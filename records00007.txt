         Gut microbiota is a determining factor in human physiological functions and health. It is commonly accepted that diet has a major influence on the gut microbial community, however, the effects of diet is not fully understood. The typical Mongolian diet is characterized by high and frequent consumption of fermented dairy products and red meat, and low level of carbohydrates. In this study, the gut microbiota profile of 26 Mongolians whom consumed wheat, rice and oat as the sole carbohydrate staple food for a week each consecutively was determined. It was observed that changes in staple carbohydrate rapidly (within a week) altered gut microbial community structure and metabolic pathway of the subjects. Wheat and oat favored bifidobacteria ( Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifodobacteriumbifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis ); whereas rice suppressed bifidobacteria ( Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis ) and wheat suppresses  Lactobaciilus, Ruminococcus  and  Bacteroides . The study exhibited two gut microbial clustering patterns with the preference of fucosyllactose utilization linking to fucosidase genes (glycoside hydrolase family classifications: GH95 and GH29) encoded by  Bifidobacterium , and xylan and arabinoxylan utilization linking to xylanase and arabinoxylanase genes encoded by  Bacteroides . There was also a correlation between  Lactobacillus ruminis  and sialidase, as well as  Butyrivibrio crossotus  and xylanase/xylosidase. Meanwhile, a strong concordance was found between the gastrointestinal bacterial microbiome and the intestinal virome. Present research will contribute to understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor, microbial populations, and the health of global humans.

       Introduction 
       The sequencing-based assessment of microbial communities in human feces has uncovered a large quantity (&gt;10 14 ) and types (&gt;1,000) of microbial species colonizing the human gut. A growing body of research has indicated that the microbial communities are associated with the digestion of dietary macronutrients, production of nutrients and vitamins and maintenance of the host immunity. Thus, the gastrointestinal microbiota can be considered a highly active metabolic organ to complement the human metabolic activities.  Wu et al. (2011)  found that two enterotypes (‘ Prevotella -type’ community and ‘ Bacteroides -type’ community) were defined among human communities in different geographical regions. The ‘ Prevotella -type’ community and the ‘ Bacteroides -type’ community were associated with fiber intake and high protein intake, respectively. The dietary fibers, proteins and peptides, which escape digestion by host enzymes in the upper gut, are metabolized by the microbiota in the colon, thus determine the microbiota in the lower reach of the gut and feces ( Macfarlane and Macfarlane, 2012 ). The metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, that are produced by gut bacterial fermentation are available to the hostenterocytes and can influence host physiological processes. The balance of the gut microbial community is a major determining factor in human physiological functions. 
       Many reports have demonstrated determining factors of the gut microbial community, these includehost genotype, diet, age, body-mass-index, disease and use of antibiotic ( Yatsunenko et al., 2012 ). It is commonly accepted that diet has a major influence on the gut microbial community. The structure of the gut microbial community can be changed by long-term consumption of a habitual diet ( Ley et al., 2006 ;  Walker et al., 2011 ;  Wu et al., 2011 ) as well as short-term consumption of certain diets ( David et al., 2014 ). Dietary alteration in the gut microbiota profile could be temporal ( David et al., 2014 ) or irreversible ( Sonnenburg et al., 2016 ). 
       In China, the dietary habit is significantly different from the western diets: Chinese diet revolves around a plant-based diet, such as cereal, vegetable, and fruit, supplemented with animal-based protein, such as dairy products, seafood and meat. The grain (wheat, rice and naked oats) is generally called staple food and accounts for a high proportion of the daily diet. In different areas of China, people have different dietary habit: the general staple food for people living south of Yangtze River is rice ( Oryza sativa  var.sinica); in the area north of the Yangtze River, people subsist chiefly on wheat ( Triticum  spp.); whereas people in the north of the Yellow River, one of the major staple food is naked oats ( Avena sativa ). The wheat, rice and naked oats contain different content of non-digestible carbohydrates (resistant starch, non-starch polysaccharides and oligosaccharides). For example, the wheat contains about 1.7% (dry matter) of non-digestible carbohydrates, mainly as xylose and arabinose, the naked oats contain 7.2% (dry matter) of arabinose, and β-glucan, whereas rice contains 0.2% non-digestible carbohydrate ( Bednar et al., 2001 ). The different grain intake may have an influence on the gut microbiota. A diet intervention study based on administration of β-glucans showed changes in the gut microbial composition ( De Angelis et al., 2015 ). The effects of carbohydrate staple diet on the gut microbial community have been little studied. A recent study comparing fecal microbiota profile of central Asian (China and Japan) and Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Thailand) speculated that non-digestible carbohydrates and meat consumption are determining dietary factors in the  Bacteroides -enterotype ( Nakayama et al., 2015 ). It is the aim of this study to investigate the effect of the three staple food grains on the gut microbial communities via diet intervention. 
       The typical Mongolian diet is characterized by a high and frequent consumption of fermented dairy products and red meat and a low level of the grain intake. The result of the diet intervention based on the type of carbohydrates for Mongolian may be more obvious than that of the Chinese. In our previous study (Sci. Bull. 61(20): 1605–1614), by using the PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing technology, we revealed the changes in intestinal microbiota of 26 Mongolian volunteers based on 16S rRNA variable regions response to staple carbohydrate. The intestinal microbiome was composed of the microbial taxonomy, microbial function and metabolic pathway. So, previous research only focused on the microbial taxonomic level couldn’t meet our further understanding of the interaction between the intestinal microbiome and diet. Accordingly, in present research the shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach was applied to generate huge sequencing reads of microbial whole genomes. Following procedure analysis involving assembling, gene prediction and pathway annotation enabled us to pay more attention to changes in intestinal microbial functional genes and metabolic pathways. Meanwhile, a robust network based on species, metabolic pathway and food nutrition was constructed for helping us understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor, microbial populations, and the health of global humans. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Study Design and Sample Collection 
         In present research, 26 Mongolian subjects (22–35 years old) started the three-week experiments on day 1 upon arrival in China. All subjects had no gastrointestinal disorder and did not take any antibiotics for three months before the experiment started and until the end of the experiment. During the experiment, dietary staple food was replaced each week (the first week: wheat, the second week: rice and third week: oat), and the amount and species of food intake for each individual was the same every day. The information was shown in the Supplementary Table  S5 . And the diet was prepared by a restaurant according to the designed recipes. All volunteers were instructed to eat only the provided foods or allowable beverages (water or unsweetened tea). They also confirmed that no remarkable changes occurred in their diet intake and no medication was taken during the experiment. The fecal samples of each individual in 4 time points (from week 0 to week 3) were collected for further sequencing. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Inner Mongolia Agriculture University (Hohhot, China). Sampling and all subsequent steps described in the Materials and Methods have been conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines. After obtaining the written informed consent, we collected habitual long-term dietary information from all participants using a food frequency questionnaire (Supplementary Table  S6 ). All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
       
       
         Metagenomic DNA Extraction 
         The QIAamp ®  DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for DNA extraction from the fecal samples. The quality of the metagenomic DNA was assessed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. All of the DNA samples were stored at –80°C until further processing. 
       
       
         Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing and Quality Control 
         The Illumina HiSeq2500 platform was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Paired-end reads were generated with 100 bp in the forward and reverse directions. The length of each read was trimmed with Sickle. This set of high-quality reads was then used for a further analysis. An average of 10.34 gigabases (Gb) of paired-end reads were obtained for each sample, totalling more than 1 Tb of high-quality data free of host genomic and adaptor contaminants. 
       
       
         Shotgun Metagenomic Reads,  De novo  Assembly, Gene Prediction, and Construction of the Non-redundant Gene Catalog 
         The Illumina reads were assembled into contigs using IDBA-UD ( Peng et al., 2012 ) with default parameters. Genes were predicted on the contigs with MetaGeneMark ( Zhu et al., 2010 ). A non-redundant gene catalog was constructed with CD-HIT ( Li and Godzik, 2006 ) using a sequence identity cut-off of 0.95, with a minimum coverage cut-off of 0.9 for the shorter sequences. This catalog contained 1,617,412 microbial genes. 
       
       
         Computation of Relative Gene Abundance 
         To assess the abundance of genes profile, reads were aligned to the gene catalog with Bowtie2 ( Langmead et al., 2009 ) using the following parameters: -p 12 -x nt -1 R1.fastq -2 R2.fastq -S R.sam. Then, for any sample N, we calculated the abundance as follows:

          xi : the number of mapped reads 
       
       
         Construction of the Taxonomic Profiling 
         We use MetaPhlAn2 ( Segata et al., 2012 ) to produce organism abundance profiling with default parameters, which relied on about 1 million unique clade-specific marker genes identified from about 17,000 reference genomes. Meanwhile, the metagenomic reads were annotated by the NCBI virus database to build the virome profile. 
       
       
         Annotation of KEGG, CAZy, and ARGs Database 
         We aligned the amino acid sequences that were translated from the gene catalog against the proteins/domains to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) databases using BLASTP ( e -value ≤ 1e-5 with a bit-score higher than 60). Each protein was assigned to the KEGG ortholog group (KO) or ARG number by the highest scoring annotated hit. CAZymes (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes) were predicted from amino acid sequences by against to family-specific HMM of CAZymes in dbCAN database ( Yin et al., 2012 ) using Hmmscan program in HMMER 3.0 package ( Eddy, 2009 ). 
       
       
         KEGG Pathway Analysis 
         Differentially enriched KO modules and pathways were identified according to the reporterscores ( Patil and Nielsen, 2005 ) from the  Z -scores of individual KOs. Accordingly, the  Z  adjusted pathway of each KEGG module and pathway was calculated as previously described ( Patil and Nielsen, 2005 ). Then, the  Z  adjusted pathway was used as the final reporter score for evaluating the enrichment of specific pathways or modules. A reporter score of &gt;2.3 (90% confidence according to the normal distribution) could be used as a detection threshold for significantly differentiating pathways. 
       
       
         Statistical Analysis 
         All statistical analyses were undertaken using the R software. PCoA and a kernel density distribution analysis were performed using the ade4 ( Zapala and Schork, 2006 ) package of R software. Differential abundance of species, genes and KOs were tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the significantly different ( p  &lt; 0.01). The heatmap was built in R using the “pheatmap” package. The correlation between the dietary components, metabolic pathways and relative genera were calculated by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and visualized by network in Cytoscape (Version 3.2.1).

         The sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the NCBI database (Metagenomic data:  SRP080787 ). 
       
     
     
       Results 
       
         Dynamic Profile of Gut Microbiome in Response to Changes in Staple Food 
         The fecal samples for all subjects were collected weekly on 4 time points, at week 0, 1, 2, and 3. Subsequently, microbial DNAs from a total of 104 fecal samples were extracted for metagenomic analysis. By employing the shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we obtained more than 1Tiga base (Tb) of pair-end reads (averagely 61,225,132 high-quality reads for each microbiota). The high-quality reads were assembled into contigs, and the genes were predicted onthe contigs. Then, a non-redundant gene catalog including 1,617,412 genes was constructed. Annotated by HMP database, thus taxonomy profile of each sample was obtained. Meanwhile, the reads were mapped to the collective gene catalog to reconstruct sample-specific gene profile, as well as the profiles for the associated KEGG database Orthologs (KO; Supplementary Table  S1 ). 
         At the taxonomy level, Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was performed based on the unweighted UniFrac ( Figure  1  ), weighted UniFrac (Supplementary Figure  S1A ) and Bray–Curtis distances (Supplementary Figure  S1B ) at the species level. No significant apparent clustering pattern was identified among samples in different time points, and the fluctuation in gut microbiota was limited by individuals. It is indicated the staple food-induced change was smaller than the inter-individual difference. This conclusion held true when the data was analyzed at microbial functional feature level (Supplementary Figure  S2 ). By extracting and comparing the first principal component of Bray–Curtis distance matrices representing taxonomic and functional features in gut community structure among subjects at each time point, we found that changed staple food rapidly altered microbial community structure and metabolic pathway ( Figure  2  ) for each individual. Then we concluded that the intestinal microbiota could be rapidly altered by staple food, however, the changes was limited at individual’s level. Additionally, in comparing the influence of the three-staple food on gut microbiome, it can be observed from the Weighted UniFrac distance between groups at different time points that the impact of wheat on intestinal microbiota was the largest, followed by rice and oat ( Figure  3  ).

         We identified differences in specific species at taxonomy level and metabolic pathway at functional level after the consumption of the respective staple food. As it is shown in  Table  1  , the species  Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides vulgatus , and  Bacteroides massiliensis  decreased significantly but the  Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum , and  Alistipes indistinctus  increased significantly when subjects consumed the wheat as staple food for one week. When rice and oat was assigned as the staple food in the second and third week, respectively,  Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Weissella cibaria , and  Rothia mucilaginosa  declined sharply in the second week whereas the  Bifidobacterium adolescentis  risen sharply in the third week. At the functional level, we calculated the reporter  Z  scores of each pathway or module by using the reporter feature algorithm ( Figure  4  ). A reporter score = 2.3 (90% confidence according to the normal distribution) was used as the detection threshold for significantly differentiating modules or pathways. In particular, we found a significant decline in the microbial biosynthesis of amino acids (including valine, leucine, and isoleucine) in the first week. In contrast, the microbial metabolism of carbohydrate kept growing during experiment. Interestingly, it exhibited a high concordance of changes in microbial capacity for fructose metabolism and glycolysis and the changes in relative content of fructose and glucose in wheat, rice and oat. And these results could be confirmed by changes in metabolic models among different staple food intake group.

         Functional Correlation of Species with Changes in the Staple Food 
         Using Wilcoxon sum  t -test, we identified species which showed significant difference in each staple food group. We focused on the correlation between functionality and changes in the staple food. The species which showed correlations included  Bacteroidesovatus, Faecalibacteriumprausnitzii, Lactobacillus ruminis, Bacteroidesstercoris , and  Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens . We determined the correlation among the species and their typical metabolic pathway/model according to Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ( R  &gt; 0.4,  Figure  5  ). Interestingly, a general positive correlation was observed between the species above and the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and the Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and a negative correlation with the FoxO signaling pathway and Cyanoamino acid metabolism.

         Concordance of the Gastrointestinal Bacterial Microbiome and Virome 
         All high-quality sequences were annotated by a virus protein database, and then we selected and constructed the phage or bacterial virus profile. A total of 144 species of phages were identified (Supplementary Table  S2 ), and the quantity of phage of  Enterobacteria, Bacteriophage, Shigella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Bacteroides, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Haemophilus, Staphylococcus, Brochothrix , and  Bacillus  accounted for more than 0.001% of the total microbiota (Supplementary Figure  S3A ). Meanwhile the correlations among the above phages were determined based on Spearman’s rank correlation (Supplementary Figure  S3B ), and a general positive correlation was found. Additionally, to test the degree of consistency between the observed clustering patterns for bacterial structure and phage structure, respectively, Procrustes analysis was performed based on the PCA matrix of bacterial genus-level organismal profile and that of genus level phage profile (Supplementary Figure  S4 ). The results revealed a strong correspondence between the two profiles above ( P  &lt; 0.001, using 10,000 Monte Carlo label permutations), which also indicated a potential synergistic interaction between the bacteria and bacterial virus in human gastrointestinal tract. 
       
       
         The Functional Specificity of Intestinal Microbiota for Carbohydrate Utilization 
         As the main component of the staple food in the present study was carbohydrate, we focused on the functional specificity of intestinal microbiota for carbohydrate utilization. The non-redundant gene catalog in our study was annotated by carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy), and a total of 383 carbohydrate metabolism related enzymes were identified (Supplementary Table  S3 ). By applying the Kruskal-Wallis test, we observed significant difference in enzymes among the different staple food groups, and these enzymes were mainly related to the metabolism of glucose (Supplementary Figure  S5 ). Meanwhile, by clustering analysis, we exhibited the correlation profile between the microbial species and the carbohydrate-active enzymes (Supplementary Figure  S6 ), and two apparent clustering patterns could be found in the profile which indicated two groups of intestinal microbiota with preference for specific carbohydrates utilization. Accordingly, we reconstruct the network between the species and their metabolic enzymes for each group ( Figure  6  ). The first group including the species of  Alistipe sputredinis, Bacteroides intestinalis, Bacteroides massiliensis, Bacteroides plebeius, Bacteroides salyersiae, Bacteroides vulgutas, Bacteroides uniformis, Butyrivibrio crossotus, Megaspha eraelsdenii, Parabacteroides merdae , and  Paraprevotella clara , and they were closely related to the carbohydrate-active enzymes of arabinofuranosidase, pectin lyase, polygalacturonaseand xylanase. The second group including the species of  Alistipesonderdonkii, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminococcus gnavus , and  Streptococcus thermophilus , and they were closely related to the carbohydrate-active enzymes of beta-glucosidase, mannosidase, trehalose phosphorylase, fucosidase, and sialidase.

         The Linear Relationship between Intestinal Microbial Phylum and Main Nutrient Elements 
         The results above based on the impacts of changes in staple food on intestinal microbiome offered us an excellent opportunity to reveal the linear relationship between intestinal microbial phylum and main nutrient elements, which was also the basic mechanism related to the interaction between the diet and gut microbiome. According to the fitted curves, we observed a declined in phylum Actinobacteria but an increase in phylum Firmicutes with the gradually increasing non-digestible carbohydrates (dietary fiber) content in diet ( Figure  7A  ). At the same time, the phylum Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria presented a positive correlation with the dietary fat and digestible carbohydrate, respectively ( Figure  7A  ).

         The Relationship between Intestinal Microbiota, Dietary Nutrition, and ARGs 
         To further understand the dietary effects on human microbiome, we annotated our non-redundant gene catalog with the ARGs database, and constructed the ARGs profile of each individuals. By merging and classifying, 290 annotated ARGs were clustered into 53 antibiotic catalog (Supplementary Table  S4 ). We found that the ARGs related to vancomycin were most abundant, followed by the ARGs related to macrolide, tetracycline, bacitracin, tigecycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, lincosamide, and aminoglycoside, which gene abundance were more than 0.001%. To describe the relationship among the dietary nutrition, microbial phylum and ARGs above, a Circos on line diagram was constructed ( Figure  7B  ). 
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       By employing the shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we described the dynamic profile of gut microbiome in response to changes in staple food. The composition of the gut microbiome can be considered as a complex trait, with the quantitative variation in the microbiome affected by a large number of host and environmental factors, each of which may have only a small additive effect, making it difficult to identify the association for each separate item. A research study of 1135 participants from a Dutch population-based cohort showed relations between the microbiome and 126 exogenous and intrinsic host factors, including 31 intrinsic factors, 12 diseases, 19 drug groups, 4 smoking categories, and 60 dietary factors ( Zhernakova et al., 2016 ). They observed that fecal chromogranin A (CgA), a protein secreted by enteroendocrine cells, was exclusively associated with 61 microbial species whose abundance collectively accounted for 53% of microbial composition. Even so, the diet and the genotype were also considered as the main force for shaping human intestinal microbiome, although it remains unclear if this is primarily driven by host genetics or by extrinsic factors like dietary intake. To address this, another recent study ( Carmody et al., 2015 ) examined the effect of dietary perturbations on the gut microbiota of five inbred mouse strains, and revealed the consumption of a high-fat, high-sugar diet reproducibly altered the gut microbiota despite differences in host genotype. Repeated dietary shifts demonstrated that most changes to the gut microbiota are reversible, which emphasize diet dominates host genotype in shaping the murine gut microbiota. Nevertheless, in the present study, we observed the staple carbohydrate-induced change was much smaller than the inter-individual difference, which indicated the complexity of the interaction between the baseline microbiota and diet change. Besides, we also found that changes in staple food rapidly altered microbial community structure and metabolic pathway for each individual. Recent research also confirmed gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet within 1 day ( David et al., 2014 ), and an animal-based diet had a greater effect on the microbiota than a plant-based diet. 
       In our previous study, the effect of subjects’ gut microbiota communities by the diet intervention of carbohydrate-rich meals composed principally of wheat, rice and oats was investigated by the PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing technology based on 16S rRNA variable region. During the diet switch within a 3-week period, the bacterial richness and diversity decreased apparently along the diet intervention. And the structure of subjects’ gut microbiota communities after the diet switch was found to be different from those before the diet switch. The previous research only focused on the changes in the microbial taxonomic level, but the intestinal microbiome including the microbial taxonomy and microbial function and metabolic pathway. Accordingly, in present research we pay more attention to the changes in intestinal microbial functional genes and metabolic pathways response to staple carbohydrate. To probe for the potential metabolic mechanism underlying the dominant species (Including  Bacteroides ovatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lactobacillus ruminis, Bacteroides stercoris , an  Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens ) which thrive in the gut environment, we analyzed the functional features in these bacteria, and revealed that these microbes were enriched in the metabolic pathway of PTS. PTS is an active sugar uptake method in low nutrient environment. The bacterial PTS is a perfect example of both the opportunistic nature of bacterial life, and their thrifty use of resources. In the present study, the up-regulation of the metabolic pathway of phosphotransferase efficiently provide the source of energy for the species involved so that they can effectively and stably proliferated in human gut. 
       The human enteric microbiome contains viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and other eukaryotic organisms ( Norman et al., 2014 ;  Virgin, 2014 ). Enteric human virome and bacterial microbiome alterations have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and changes in host behavior ( Backhed et al., 2012 ;  Lyte, 2013 ;  Norman et al., 2015 ). In the present study, we observed a robust synergistic interaction between the bacteria and bacterial virus in human gastrointestinal tract in dynamic equilibrium with all components of the microbiome. Accordingly, an emerging concept is that the virome may contain mutualistic symbiotes with some effects that benefit the host and others by modulating the population of their bacterial host. Bacteriophages regulate the bacterial microbiome via gene transfer, killing competing bacteria to allow invasion of prophage-containing bacteria to fill a partly emptied niche, or by encoding toxins that alter the host intestine to foster bacterial pathogenesis ( Duerkop and Hooper, 2013 ). 
       The ability to utilize complex dietary and host glycans is central to the survival of prominent members of the gut microbiota. Plants in the form of fruits, vegetables, and cereals are major components of the human diet ( El Kaoutari et al., 2013b ). They provide carbohydrates that are readily digested by human intestinal enzymes, as well as dietary fibers, which are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine. Carbohydrate-active enzymes encoded by the human gut microbiome catalyze the breakdown of glycoconjugates, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides to fermentable monosaccharides ( El Kaoutari et al., 2013a ). Here, we exhibited two apparent gut microbial clustering patterns with the preference of specific carbohydrates utilization. For instance, the fucosyllactose utilization was linked tofucosidase genes (glycoside hydrolase family classifications: GH95 and GH29) encoded by  Bifidobacterium  ( Milani et al., 2015 ) and the xylan and arabinoxylan utilization was linked to xylanase and arabinoxylanase genesencoded by  Bacteroides  ( Wu et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, we revealed the robust correlation between the  Lactobacillus ruminis  and sialidase as well as the  Butyrivibriocrossotus  and xylanase/xylosidase. These findings allow modeling of human gut microbiome, responding to diet change, and tailor-designed prebiotics for precision microbiota manipulation. 
       In summary, this study describes the dynamic profile of gut microbiome in 26 Mongolians in response to changes in staple food (consumed wheat, rice and oat as the sole carbohydrate) for 3 weeks, and revealed the impact of wheat on intestinal microbiota was the largest, followed by rice and oat. Accordingly, we exhibited the specificity of intestinal microbiota for carbohydrate utilizing and the linear relationship between intestinal microbiota and major nutrient elements. Meanwhile, a strong concordance was found between the gastrointestinal bacterial microbiome and the intestinal virome. Present research will contribute to understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor, microbial populations, and the health of global humans.

          Objective : Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enable measures of the corticospinal excitability (CSE). However the reliability of TMS-derived CSE measures is suboptimal due to appreciable pulse-to-pulse MEP amplitude variability. We thus calculated how many TMS–derived MEPs will be needed to obtain a reliable CSE measure in awake adult subjects, in the eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. 
          Methods : Twenty healthy adults (70% male) received 40 consecutive navigated TMS pulses (120% resting motor threshold, RMT) in the EO or EC conditions on two separate days in randomized order. 
          Results : For either the EO or EC condition, the probability that the 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from consecutive MEP amplitude measured included the true CSE, increased when the number of consecutive stimuli increased (EO:  p  = 0.05; EC:  p  = 0.001). No significant effect of RMT, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, or gender on the CSE estimates was identified. At least 34 consecutive stimuli were required to obtain a most reliable CSE estimate in the EO condition and 31 in the EC condition. 
          Conclusion : Our findings indicate that &gt;30 consecutive MEPs may be necessary in order to obtain a CSE measure in healthy adults.

       Introduction 
       Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, painless and safe method for focal cortical stimulation induced by generating high-intensity magnetic field by passing a brief intracranial electrical current through a magnetic coil (Barker et al.,  1985 ; Kobayashi and Pascual-Leone,  2003 ). When applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) and coupled with hand surface electromyography (EMG), TMS is often used to measure corticospinal excitability (CSE) as reflected in the amplitude or area under the curve of a hand muscle TMS-induced motor evoked potential (MEP). CSE is generally equated to the average MEP amplitude, resulting from multiple stimuli to the same region at identical intensities (Kiers et al.,  1993 ; Magistris et al.,  1998 ; Rösler et al.,  2002 ; Pitcher et al.,  2003 ; Darling et al.,  2006 ; Mars et al.,  2007 ; Bashir et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ; Roy Choudhury et al.,  2011 ; Lewis et al.,  2014 ; Cakar et al.,  2016 ). Yet MEP amplitudes vary considerably from pulse to pulse in individual subjects (Magistris et al.,  1998 ; Rösler et al.,  2002 ; Pitcher et al.,  2003 ; Roy Choudhury et al.,  2011 ), and this leads to compromising reliability of CSE metrics. In most protocols, 6–10 MEPs are averaged for the CSE estimate (Magistris et al.,  1998 ; Rösler et al.,  2002 ; Pitcher et al.,  2003 ; Bashir et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ; Roy Choudhury et al.,  2011 ; Lewis et al.,  2014 ). Yet number of TMS pulses and MEPs that are necessary to obtain a reliable CSE estimate is unknown? We therefore stimulated the motor cortex in healthy volunteers, and measured the number of intrinsic hand muscle MEP amplitudes that would be needed to obtain a reliable CSE estimate. 
       Since the instantaneous state of cortical motor neuron and cortical interneuron activity likely plays a role in MEP amplitude variability in TMS experiments, we obtained these measures in two conditions: awake with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), which previously have been demonstrated to modulate cortical and/or spinal motoneural output (Rossini et al.,  1991 ). 
       In the present experiment, we hypothesized to test whether the number of pulses needed to establish a CSE metric from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle representation is mediated by factor for which studies may not reliably control: activation of the visual system as defined by the EO and EC condition. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Subjects 
         Twenty right-handed control subjects (age 19–31 years; 70% males) participated in this study (Table  1 ). The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI; Oldfield,  1971 ) was administered to verify that all subjects were right-handed (right-handedness 1.93 ± 0.27). The participants had normal cognitive scores (normal range: 28–30) as indexed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al.,  2001 ).

         Participants underwent two experimental sessions separated by 1 week using a within-subjects, a crossover randomized design, during which they underwent M1 TMS with MEP monitoring in either the EO or EC condition. 
         Participants had no contraindications to receive TMS and were not taking any medication known to affect motor cortical excitability at the time of the study (Rossi et al.,  2009 ). Furthermore, neurological examination of the subjects revealed no abnormal signs to suggest any underlying neurological or psychological condition. The investigation was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Review Board (King Khalid University Hospital). All participants gave their written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. 
       
       
         Experimental Set-Up 
         The stimulation setup consisted of a frameless stereotaxic system for navigation (Visor2 ANT; Netherlands) connected to TMS system (Mag Pro X100 (MagVenture, Denmark)). All subjects had a high-resolution anatomical head magnetic resonance image (MRI) that was used to ensure stimulation accuracy during and across sessions. In each follow-up session co-registration errors to the MRI’s surface landmarks were matched to ≤3 mm. 
         Surface EMG signals were recorded from FDI muscle in which active electrodes were attached and reference electrodes were placed over the metacarpophalangeal joints. These EMG signals were band-pass filtered (8−500 Hz), amplified, displayed and stored for off-line analysis. The TMS system delivered trigger pulses that synchronized with EMG systems. 
         During the sessions participants sat on a comfortable chair with their hands in a supine position on their laps, wearing earplugs, and remaining silent to avoid speech-induced modulation of cortical (Bashir et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ). 
       
       
         TMS Protocol 
         All subjects had undergone a high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI scan before TMS session. Imaging data were fed to the navigation software (Visor2, ANT, Netherlands) for automatic 3D brain reconstruction that was used to guide navigation and deliver TMS over M1 (“hot spot”). In each TMS session, the motor cortical output was mapped carefully for the optimal representation of the FDI muscle on left hemisphere (dominant hemisphere) as previously described (Bashir et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ). 
         The TMS coil was held tangentially to the skull with the coil handle pointed 45° posterior-laterally to the sagittal plane, which the coil and the induced current on the cortex orientated perpendicularly to the anatomically defined central sulcus and induces a posterior-to-anterior current direction (Bashir et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ). 
         Each individual’s resting motor threshold (RMT) was determined as the minimum %maximal stimulation output (MSO) TMS intensity that produced at least 5 out of 10 MEPs ≥50 μV, that was obtained at that location. The site which evoked MEPs with highest amplitude (henceforth, the hot spot) was then marked on each subject’s MRI. Nearly always, the hotspot did not change; sometimes, the coil position needed a minor adjustment in roll or pitch. Forty single stimuli 4–8 s apart were delivered to the hot spot at an intensity of 120% of RMT to determine baseline MEP peak to peak amplitude for the EO and EC conditions. 
       
       
         MEP Data Analysis 
         To minimize the variability of TMS-induced individual MEPs, they were screened for artifact and for signal indicating voluntary contraction, and excluded (&lt;1%) if the root mean square EMG exceeded 5 mV during the 50-ms period immediately preceding the onset of the TMS pulse as previously described (Cuypers et al.,  2014 ). All subjects data were analyzed for 2 blocks (EO and EC) of 40 consecutive TMS stimuli at 120% RMT. The order of these two conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across participants. For each subject, the average MEPs of EO or EC was calculated for subsets of consecutive stimuli:

         The generalized estimating equation (GEE; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to determine the contribution of the EO and EC condition, as well as gender and MMSE score on the       MEPn   ¯     . To evaluate the accuracy of the MEP estimates, a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using all 40 stimuli for each subject, per condition as previously described (Cuypers et al.,  2014 ). Based on both the MEPn values and the CI, it is possible to determine whether MEPn is included in CI, yielding a binary variable (0 = not included in the CI, 1 = included in the CI) as previously described by Cuypers et al. ( 2014 ). The number of consecutive stimuli required as a function of the probability of hitting the 95% CI. 
       
     
     
       Results 
       The CSE estimates did not differ between the EO and EC conditions. The probability that MEPn fell within the CI 40  CSE estimate increased with successive TMS pulses (Figure  1 ). The GEE analysis showed that the estimate of the CI increased when the number of consecutive stimuli increased ( p  = 0.05 for EO and  p  = 0.001 for EC).

The  Y -axis shows the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (μV), while the number of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimuli ( n ) is shown on the  X -axis. White dots represent the individual (raw) MEPs, whereas the black dots represent the average of consecutive MEPs (MEPn). Dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval (CI), which is based upon all 40 stimuli. 
         
         
       
       At least 31 consecutive stimuli were required in EO and 34 in EC condition to reach a 100% probability that the average of MEP fell within the 95% CI 40  (Figure  2 , Tables  2 ,  3 ). The GEE analysis showed a not significant effect of RMT, MMSE and gender on CSE estimates (all,  p  &lt; 0.05). The interaction effect of RMT was not significant. But the age was significant with EC condition. As the age increased, the probability of 95% CI also increased. Female with EO: 29th, with EC: 24th and the male with EO: 31th, with EC condition: 34th (Table  4 ).

       Discussion 
       We demonstrate that &gt;30 stimuli are required to obtain an accurate CSE estimate when MEP measures are obtained from the FDI muscle in healthy adults. Notably, this measure is independent of RMT, and gender. This basic practical information might play a crucial role for obtaining a reliable CSE in the TMS experiments. This study showed the intra-rater reliability, as every part of the data were collected by the same rater. 
       The interpretation of our results about CSE estimates by number of consecutive stimuli might be required different for other age groups and in disease populations, because our data was obtained in healthy young subjects. Second, all subjects were informed with respect to the experimental procedures due to uncertainty about their first TMS experience; which likely caused changes in attention, and this variable may differ from study to study. Furthermore, experimental set-up (navigated TMS, different coil types and shapes), EMG hardware and signal analysis for noise elimination can affect variability and reliability of the CSE measurements. Last our measures were obtained from the CI muscle (FDI) and a different numerical result may be seen in other muscle groups. 
       It is paramount that any reliability studies, such as ours, clearly outline the extent to which its results can be generalized. We thus proposed to extrapolate from our results with qualification. Reliability and reproducibility of protocol depends on the sample, the paradigm, the TMS setup and the operator (Beckerman et al.,  2001 ). 
       The variability related to the TMS method should be similar across the laboratories, when one considers that we used stimulator and recording devices that is commonly available. This is the first TMS reliability study showing spatial stimulation stability within and between sessions using neuronavigation (Schönfeldt-Lecuona et al.,  2005 ). It is noteworthy to emphasize that the lack of controlling in pitch and roll of TMS coil just by using marked scalps or swimming caps can cause measurement error as it allows spatial drift (Julkunen et al.,  2009 ) and reduces the constancy and strength of intracranial electrical currents conveyed to a target (Cincotta et al.,  2010 ). 
       The design of TMS experiments can be improved by the present study outcome.

         Eukaryotic genomes frequently exhibit interdependency between transcriptional units, as evidenced by regions of high gene density. It is well recognized that vertebrate microRNAs (miRNAs) are usually embedded in those regions. Recent work has shown that the genomic context is of utmost importance to determine miRNA expression in time and space, thus affecting their evolutionary fates over long and short terms. Consequently, understanding the inter- and intraspecific changes on miRNA genomic architecture may bring novel insights on the basic cellular processes regulated by miRNAs, as well as phenotypic evolution and disease-related mechanisms.

       Introduction 
       Recent genome-wide projects have revealed an outstanding transcriptome diversity, especially of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as well as a wealth of regulatory mechanisms and gene product interactions that compound the molecular basis of phenotypes ( Carninci et al., 2005 ;  Mele et al., 2015 ). A notable feature that soon became clear is the interleaved nature of eukaryotic genomes, despite their typical large sizes. This means that a particular genomic region can be suited for different purposes, with an extensive overlap of transcriptional units either in sense or antisense DNA strands ( Kapranov et al., 2007 ). 
       The interleaved model opens up numerous possibilities for regulatory mechanisms. For instance, products of antisense transcription, which is believed to occur in more than 30% of gene loci in humans ( Galante et al., 2007 ), can regulate gene activity through many different ways (reviewed in  Pelechano and Steinmetz, 2013 ). In the interleaved genome, transcription units may show high interdependency, whereby neighboring or overlapping genes can be co-regulated by shared regulatory elements; yet, structural changes in the chromatin environment can also influence their expression coordinately ( Mellor et al., 2016 ). Complex transcriptional networks thus emerge from a modular architecture that can either be shaped by evolutionary advantages and constraints ( Mercer and Mattick, 2013 ), but also as a result of neutral processes ( Graur et al., 2015 ). Such interleaved architecture is particularly striking in regard to microRNAs (miRNAs). Ever since the first large-scale studies on their genomic organization ( Rodriguez et al., 2004 ), it is commonly observed that these small non-coding RNAs overlap to protein-coding genes, with vertebrate miRNAs mapping to intronic regions more than expected by chance ( Baskerville and Bartel, 2005 ;  Hinske et al., 2010 ,  2014 ;  Campo-Paysaa et al., 2011 ;  Meunier et al., 2013 ). As they comprise an essential class of gene expression regulators in basic biological processes and diseases, genomic context analyses are pivotal to uncover unique aspects of miRNA biology. Here, we discuss recent advances in this topic focusing on the importance of the genomic context to miRNA expression and their target interactions. In this framework, we highlight the evolutionary consequences for the fixation of newly emerged miRNAs and functional properties arising from miRNA–genomic context relationships over long-and short-evolutionary terms. 
     
     
       The Impact of the Genomic Context on miRNA Expression and Function 
       As any other gene, the evolutionary processes that gives rise to new miRNAs – mainly by duplication or  de novo  origin ( Berezikov, 2011 ;  Meunier et al., 2013 ) – takes place on certain regions of the genome that may overlap or not to preexisting gene loci. In a recent study,  Meunier et al. (2013)  showed that all vertebrate species analyzed (Chicken, Platypus, Opossum, Mouse, Macaque, and Human) have a significant excess of intragenic miRNAs, with on average 54% of them overlapping to introns. Curiously, the proportions of intronic miRNAs are even higher for those of recent origin, suggesting that introns are hotspots for new miRNA origination. Moreover, the transcriptional orientation of intragenic miRNAs is highly biased (∼80%) toward the same strand orientation of their host genes ( Rodriguez et al., 2004 ;  Campo-Paysaa et al., 2011 ;  Meunier et al., 2013 ;  Hinske et al., 2014 ). 
       Given the large size of vertebrate genomes, why do miRNAs apparently have such preference to emerge in intragenic regions? Which evidences support the role of natural selection shaping this pattern, and what advantages miRNAs might take from such genomic organization? To address these questions,  França et al. (2016)  investigated the patterns of emergence and expression of human miRNAs along the vertebrate evolution considering the evolutionary origin of their host genes, i.e., whether miRNAs are intergenic, mapped to old protein-coding genes (originated before fish and tetrapods divergence), or to young protein-coding genes (originated after the divergence). Similar to previous studies ( Iwama et al., 2013 ), it was shown that most human miRNAs (∼70%) have a relatively recent origin, emerging in the primate order. Though an interesting pattern was revealed, the majority of those young miRNAs are intragenic and preferentially embedded within old host genes, even when controlled by host gene length (including intronic region) and expression level. Expression breadth analyses showed that young miRNAs hosted by old genes were more broadly expressed (expression in more tissues) than their intergenic counterparts. On the other hand, miRNAs hosted by young genes showed a bias to tissue-specific expression when compared to the intergenic ones or those within old genes. The same conclusions held when a very stringent miRNA annotation provided by  Fromm et al. (2015)  was considered, since several miRBase entries do not represent bonafide miRNAs ( Chiang et al., 2010 ;  Taylor et al., 2014 ;  Fromm et al., 2015 ). It is well established that expression breadth is negatively correlated with evolutionary rates ( Wolf et al., 2009 ;  Park and Choi, 2010 ), meaning that overall conserved genes are highly and broadly expressed, whereas less conserved genes tend to have low and narrow expression. What turns out is that the expression of intragenic miRNAs is tightly coupled to their genomic environment, especially in regard to the evolutionary ages of their host genes. In a mechanistic way, this is clearly connected with the co-expression of miRNA–host gene pairs by shared regulatory elements, a very well-documented event ( Baskerville and Bartel, 2005 ;  Ozsolak et al., 2008 ;  Marsico et al., 2013 ). Hence, the maintenance of miRNAs embedded in genic regions may be indicative of some evolutionary constraint, since young and older intragenic miRNAs are biased toward host gene sense orientation, as well as preferential emergence within old host genes. In addition, same age miRNAs show differential expression breadth depending on their genomic context, a pattern that is maintained not only during recent (e.g., primates) but also over longer periods. Such pattern is observed for miRNAs originated in amniotes (e.g., chicken) or in placental mammals (e.g., mouse) presenting higher or lower expression breadth depending on the age of their host genes ( França et al., 2016 ). 
       In particular for young intragenic miRNAs, being hosted by old genes could be beneficial at least during an initial adaptive phase, because of the expression broadness achieved through a presumably favorable transcriptional environment. Instead of readily relying on the settlement of their own regulatory apparatus, young miRNAs would initially been benefited by their hosts’ regulatory elements, albeit they may acquire independent regulation afterward ( França et al., 2016 ). Supporting this notion, it has been suggested that young and middle-aged intragenic miRNAs are more likely to be regulated by shared promoters, whereas old miRNAs are frequently regulated by their independent intronic promoters ( Marsico et al., 2013 ). In addition, as old host genes provide higher expression breadth for those young miRNAs, it would, in principle, increase the opportunities for new target interactions in different tissues. From such perspective, the host transcriptional environment could facilitate the initial expression of young miRNAs and thereafter contribute to the process of miRNA functionalization. 
       The location of a gene in the genome is clearly related to its expression, as revealed by transgene insertion experiments ( Mlynárová et al., 2002 ) and global expression analyses of gene neighborhoods ( Caron et al., 2001 ;  Purmann et al., 2007 ;  Michalak, 2008 ). Nevertheless, some of the observed expression changes in gene vicinity may not be subjected to selection, but rather it would be a consequence of expression changes in a close gene under strong selection. Recently,  Ghanbarian and Hurst (2015)  demonstrated that expression changes in humans, relative to the human–chimp common ancestor, coordinately drive changes in expression of the neighbors of a focal gene, and that this effect is stronger as the distance between genes are shorter (&lt;100kbp). Therefore, the genomic context still may yield important effects on the expression, and perhaps the fixation of novel miRNAs that are not under direct selection. 
     
     
       Evolutionary Conservation and Novelties From miRNAs’ Genomic Context 
       The phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs in vertebrates is distinguished by the presence of deeply conserved and abundant clade or species-specific repertoires ( Berezikov et al., 2006 ;  Wheeler et al., 2009 ;  Meunier et al., 2013 ;  Fromm et al., 2015 ). Although the evolution of miRNA sequences have been investigated ( Lyu et al., 2014 ;  Ninova et al., 2014 ), the conserved patterns and evolutionary innovations that arose due to interspecific differences in the genomic context are largely underexplored. One of the few studies to address this issue compared the genomic location and expression of ∼100 miRNAs during developmental stages of medaka fish, zebrafish, chicken, and mouse ( Ason et al., 2006 ). It was demonstrated that spatial expression differences can be related to changes either in the miRNA location and copy number variation rather than to sequence divergence ( Ason et al., 2006 ). Actually, the miRNA genomic location is thought to influence their expression divergence, as old- and middle-aged intragenic miRNAs tend to be more similarly expressed among species than intergenic ones ( França et al., 2016 ). 
       Such kind of expression constraint linked to a conserved genomic context is clearly observed for  miR-490  and its host gene  CHRM2  ( França et al., 2016 ). Homologous sequences of  miR-490  are found across amniotes, with identical mature sequences from human to chicken. Gene order and location of  miR-490  in the second intron of  CHRM2  are also preserved ( Figure  1A  ). Although  miR-490  is annotated as intergenic in chicken, predicted transcripts with an intron overlapping  miR-490  are annotated. Expression analyses reveal a strongly conserved pattern among human, rhesus macaque, mouse, and chicken; indicating concomitant expression of  miR-490  and  CHRM2  ( Shen et al., 2015 ) with highest abundance in heart ( Figure  1A  ). The host gene is a muscarinic cholinergic receptor involved in acetylcholine-mediated cardiac chronotropic (heart rate) and inotropic (strength of muscle contraction) effects ( Brodde and Michel, 1999 ), and it has been associated with cardiomyopathy ( Zhang et al., 2008 ). Notably, dysregulation of  miR-490  is also reported in cardiac disease ( Cooley et al., 2012 ) and is involved with proliferation of human coronary artery smooth cells ( Sun et al., 2013 ), suggesting an important functional connection between  miR-490  and  CHRM2 .

            Genomic context conservation of intragenic miRNAs. (A)  The human  miR-490  embedded within  CHRM2  reveals a highly conserved pattern in terms of sequence (left panel) and expression (right panel). Alignments from the UCSC genome browser indicate the preservation of  miR-490  throughout amniotes (green bars) with few differing bases (light blue squares) and identical mature sequences (orange lines). High-phyloP base scores indicate strong purifying selection on this region.  MiR-490  and  CHRM2  are co-expressed with highest levels in heart, a pattern conserved in other species.  (B)  The human  miR-625 , encoded within  FUT8 , has homologous sequences only in primates. The expression of  miR-625  follows its host pattern, with higher levels in brain and cerebellum, possibly reflecting rapid evolution. Expression of  miR-625  in rhesus was not detected. Expression data were obtained from  Brawand et al. (2011)  and  Meunier et al. (2013)  and processed in  França et al. (2016) . Tissues are: heart (H), brain (B), cerebellum (C), kidney (K), and testis (T). 
         
         
       
       As mentioned earlier, the transcriptional environment of host genes may act as a key factor to promote the expression of newly emerged miRNAs. This phenomenon is well illustrated by the primate-specific  miR-625  encoded within  FUT8  ( Figure  1B  ). This host gene is a fucosyltransferase well-conserved throughout animals ( Costache et al., 1997 ;  Juliant et al., 2014 ) that catalyzes fucosylation of glycoproteins, which is essential for activating growth factor receptors ( Liu et al., 2011 ), while its deletion has lethal effects in mice ( Wang et al., 2005 ).  FUT8  is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues ( Mele et al., 2015 ) and  miR-625  seems to follow its host expression pattern ( Figure  1B  ). Considering the young evolutionary age of  miR-625 , its expression levels and breadth are unusually high, thus being frequently altered in different types of cancer ( Zhou et al., 2014 ;  Zheng et al., 2015 ). It is interesting that  miR-625  has emerged as a promising predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer ( Verma et al., 2015 ;  Rasmussen et al., 2016 ), exhibiting strong association with oxaliplatin (a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer) resistance ( Rasmussen et al., 2016 ). 
       Another singular feature of miRNAs is their frequent occurrence in clusters, originated through tandem or non-local duplications or by  de novo  mutations either in introns or intergenic regions ( Berezikov, 2011 ). Such genomic organization is prone to greatly affect the evolution of newly emerged miRNAs. According to  Wang et al. (2016) , members of the same cluster tend to exhibit coordinated expression and to target overlapping sets of genes. The authors proposed that clustering arrangement and by developing functions related to the pre-existing miRNAs in the same cluster would help the initial survival of these young miRNAs, until the cluster is settled up by purifying selection. Otherwise, the most usual fate of  de novo  newly emerged miRNAs would to undergo rapid degeneration. In further support of this “functional co-adaptation” model, clustered young miRNAs indeed present significant signs of adaptive changes that probably drive them to functional constraints associated with the older members of the cluster ( Wang et al., 2016 ). 
     
     
       miRNA–Target Interactions: Functional and Evolutionary Implications 
       If a recently emerged miRNA is expressed and integrated into regulatory networks through consistent and biologically relevant target interactions, it will have more chances to become functional and be retained afterward over long periods ( Chen and Rajewsky, 2007 ;  Lyu et al., 2014 ). Therefore, young miRNAs originated in a genomic context able to boost their expression in multiple tissues would favor target recognition. This idea is consistent with the previous observation that young miRNAs emerged within old host genes are expressed in more tissues and tend to have more predicted targets compared to young intergenic ones ( França et al., 2016 ). We, therefore, suggested a miRNA evolution model that takes into account not only the miRNAs themselves, but also their genomic context ( França et al., 2016 ) ( Figure  2  ). Hence, young miRNAs (or “proto” miRNAs) hosted by old genes would gain higher expression breadth benefited by their host’s transcriptional activity, thus enabling many target interactions that, at first glance, are mostly neutral ( Chen and Rajewsky, 2007 ;  Nozawa et al., 2016 ), but could be stabilized by natural selection over time. On the other hand, as young intergenic miRNAs tend to have narrower expression, and apparently less targets to interact with, they could undergo faster degeneration ( Figure  2  ). This degeneration scenario is also most likely to happen with miRNAs emerged within young hosts, because of their general tissue-specific expression signature ( França et al., 2016 ). 
       
         FIGURE 2 
         
            Model of miRNA evolution.  Young miRNAs emerged within old genes are expressed in more tissues and, therefore, could interact with diverse set of targets, possibly enhancing the chances of functionalization and fixation through time. In contrast, as young intergenic miRNAs tend to be tissue-specific (likely expressed in testis), very limited target interactions could contribute to their faster degeneration. 
         
         
       
       Evolutionary sequence conservation has been successfully introduced to reduce the number of false-positive and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in target predictions. Instead of helping identifying conserved pathways and relationships among miRNAs and their targets ( Hausser and Zavolan, 2014 ), this requirement comes with a drawback, since it can only be applied to miRNAs and target genes that have conservation data available and which are not species-specific. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that target sites identified by cross-linking immunoprecipitation data are rarely conserved between distantly related species, but extensive conservation is observed between closely related ones ( Xu et al., 2013 ). Even when considering species-specific sites, there is evidence of selective constraints compared to non-target sites across the 3′UTR region, suggesting that most of non-conserved targets might be functional at least for a short evolutionary period. A striking example of this condition is the human-specific target site for  miR-183  in the 3vUTR of the transcription factor  FOXO1 , whose regulation altered FOXO1-dependent phenotypes, such as proliferation and migration, in a species-specific manner ( McLoughlin et al., 2014 ). Despite of the recent advances on the characterization of operating mechanisms that guide miRNA–target interactions, we are only on the verge of understanding how newly emerged miRNAs in different genomic contexts are integrated into regulatory networks, as well as how their novel target interactions contribute to phenotypic plasticity. 
     
     
       Population Biology Perspective for the Genome Architecture of miRNAs 
       Population biology studies at the genome level have been proved to be promising tools, enhancing our understanding on how genetic elements are interconnected spatially and temporally ( Barrón et al., 2014 ;  Sudmant et al., 2015 ). Most of miRNA population studies have focused on the impact of single nucleotide variants localized inside the seed and the mature regions to analyze conservation patterns, target diversification, and differential disease susceptibility (e.g.,  Barbash et al., 2014 ;  Rawlings-Goss et al., 2014 ;  Gallego et al., 2016 ). Except for few studies of miRNA expression quantitative trait loci (e.g.,  Huan et al., 2015 ), the evolution of miRNA genomic architecture has not been deeply investigated using a population biology framework. 
       It is still unknown if variation in miRNAs sequence, expression, and target sites across populations are more relevant for uncovering the mechanisms of phenotypic evolution and disease than other genetic variation. On one hand, due to its folded structure and small size, miRNAs are more likely to emerge  de novo  than novel protein coding genes ( Berezikov, 2011 ). Diversification of miRNA target repertoire may be more prone to appear as result of simple sequence modifications such as direct mutation, seed or hairpin shifting, and arm switching ( Berezikov, 2011 ). Therefore, variation on miRNA-binding sites indeed can lead to phenotypic innovation, as exemplified by the lineage diversification of cichlid fishes ( Loh et al., 2011 ;  Franchini et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, as target mRNAs can be regulated subtly by several miRNAs, detecting phenotypical effects by population variation seems to be harder than for genetic variation in regulatory or coding regions. Indeed, most of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the creation of novel miRNA target sites does not correlate with phenotypic differences among humans ( Saunders et al., 2007 ). 
       Nonetheless, it is possible that genomic comparisons of different individuals can give insights on the origination process of miRNAs, as previously done for other genetic elements ( Hatcher, 2000 ;  Schlötterer, 2015 ). For instance, the basis of retrogene origination in metazoans has been recently deciphered through  Drosophila  population data. Flanking regions signatures of polymorphic retrocopies revealed that long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons have mediate their formation ( Tan et al., 2016 ). miRNAs are mostly originated  de novo  or by duplication ( Meunier et al., 2013 ), but mechanistic details on how those processes occur are still unknown. Population genomics might help uncover those components through the identification of mutational signatures attached to polymorphic miRNAs that are usually erased by time and throughout their fixation. 
       In addition, comparing fixed patterns present in different species to polymorphic states observed in a group of individuals are useful tools for contrasting genomic features driven by natural selection to patterns produced by mutation bias ( Long et al., 2013 ). Notable, this type of comparison helped to support the hypothesis in which natural selection drives retrogene duplication from the X chromosome to the autosomes in  Drosophila  and humans ( Schrider et al., 2011 ,  2013 ;  Navarro and Galante, 2015 ). Therefore, the analyses of different human populations can give further support to the adapted pattern of miRNAs organized inside old protein coding host genes. 
       Furthermore, as miRNAs expression and targeting has been shown to be implicated in a wide of human diseases ( Mendell and Olson, 2012 ), seed, and mature region variants found among ethnic populations become clinically important ( Rawlings-Goss et al., 2014 ). More specifically, there are distinct miRNA profiles in diseases between African and European descendants (e.g.,  Huang et al., 2011 ;  Heegaard et al., 2012 ) which could be responsible for differences among those populations in susceptibility to diseases, drug sensitiveness, and biomarker diagnostics ( Rawlings-Goss et al., 2014 ). Therefore, should worth investigating if ethnic group variation on miRNA genomic context have also significant role in human health. 
       From the discussion above, it turns out that the genomic context, as an outcome of natural selection, imposes evolutionary constraints to maintain the structural and functional integrity of its genetic elements. Moreover, it can also propel the evolutionary fate of new elements that arise in a suitable environment, eventually accelerating the process of functionalization. Therefore, evolutionary models tackling the 3D chromatin organization will be of extreme value to pursue the general principles that afford those processes take place throughout genomes.

         Disease outbreaks of verotoxin-producing  Escherichia coli  (VTEC) O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes associated with leafy green vegetables are becoming a growing concern. A better understanding of the behavior of VTEC, particularly non-O157 serotypes, on lettuce under stress conditions is necessary for designing more effective control strategies. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) can be used as a sanitizer to reduce the microbial load in leafy green vegetables, particularly in fresh produce destined for the organic market. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that H 2 O 2  treatment of contaminated lettuce affects in the same manner transcription of stress-associated and virulence genes in VTEC strains representing O157 and non-O157 serotypes. Six VTEC isolates representing serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, O104:H4, O111:NM, O145:NM, and O157:H7 were included in this study. The results indicate that 50 mM H 2 O 2  caused a population reduction of 2.4–2.8 log 10  (compared to non-treated control samples) in all six VTEC strains present on romaine lettuce. Following the treatment, the transcription of genes related to oxidative stress ( oxyR  and  sodA ), general stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid stress ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ), and virulence ( stx1A ,  stx2A , and  fliC ) were dramatically downregulated in all six VTEC serotypes ( P  ≤ 0.05) compared to not treated control samples. Therefore, VTEC O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes on lettuce showed similar survival rates and gene transcription profiles in response to 50 mM H 2 O 2  treatment. Thus, the results derived from this study provide a basic understanding of the influence of H 2 O 2  treatment on the survival and virulence of VTEC O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes on lettuce.

       Introduction 
       Verotoxin-producing  Escherichia coli  (VTEC), also referred to as Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing  E. coli  (STEC), often cause life-threatening diseases, such as hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) ( Croxen et al., 2013 ;  Karpman and Stahl, 2014 ;  Karmali, 2017 ). Although VTEC serotype O157:H7 is commonly identified in human diseases, non-O157 serogroups have been increasingly associated with serious outbreaks and were recently responsible for more than 50% of STEC illness in U.S. ( Luna-Gierke et al., 2014 ;  Parsons et al., 2016 ;  CDC, 2017 ). In 2015, the incidence of confirmed VTEC non-O157 infections was 40% higher than in 2012–2014 ( Huang et al., 2016 ). More than 70% of infections linked to non-O157 VTEC were caused by serotypes O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 (termed the Top 6;  Saito et al., 1998 ;  Brooks et al., 2005 ;  Folster et al., 2011 ;  Bradley et al., 2012 ;  Brown et al., 2012 ). In 2011, enteroaggregative  E. coli  O104:H4 caused the biggest outbreak in Germany. This strain produces Stx2 and is one of the most virulent strains of non-O157 VTEC ( Buchholz et al., 2011 ;  Zangari et al., 2013 ;  Karmali, 2017 ). 
       Fresh leafy green vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet due to their richness in minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals. However, leafy green vegetables can be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria such as VTEC during growth, harvesting, and transportation leading to subsequent illnesses and outbreaks ( Wachtel et al., 2002 ;  Solomon et al., 2003 ;  Islam et al., 2004 ;  Delaquis et al., 2007 ). A number of surveys have shown an increase in foodborne outbreaks linked to contaminated leafy green vegetables ( Harris et al., 2003 ;  Sivapalasingam et al., 2004 ;  Rangel et al., 2005 ;  Lynch et al., 2009 ;  Painter et al., 2013 ;  Herman et al., 2015 ). Although the contamination can be minimized by preventing produce exposure to sources of pathogenic bacteria, including contaminated water, soil, and animals, the occasional contamination of leafy green vegetables on farms by VTEC can still occur, which leads to contaminated produce entering the processing lines ( Olaimat and Holley, 2012 ). Therefore, effectively reducing the contamination during processing is crucial to ensure the safety of fresh leafy green vegetables. 
       Chlorine has been widely used as a sanitizer to reduce the microbial load in fresh-cut vegetables ( Beuchat et al., 1998 ). However, chlorine may react to form potentially carcinogenic or mutagenic products ( Hurst, 1995 ). In addition, the by-products formed when sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl—another sanitizer commonly used in the fresh produce industry) reacts with organic compounds, have been shown to increase the risk of bladder cancer ( Villanueva et al., 2004 ). Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is a potential alternative to chlorine treatment and breaks down to ecologically friendly water and oxygen ( Linley et al., 2012 ). In addition, H 2 O 2  has been approved for use in organic postharvest processing systems. As such, this sanitizer could be used for decontamination of fresh produce destined for organic market. 
       To date, several studies have been conducted on the gene expression in pure culture of  E. coli  O157:H7 under oxidative stress ( Wang et al., 2009 ;  Allen and Griffiths, 2012 ;  Mei et al., 2015 ). In addition, using H 2 O 2  as a sanitizer on fresh produce to reduce  E. coli  O157:H7 was investigated ( Sapers et al., 2000 ;  Huang et al., 2012 ). However, the survival and gene transcription of non-O157 VTEC serotypes under stress conditions on lettuce remain largely unknown. In this study, the behaviors of O157:H7 and non-O157 VTEC serotypes in response to H 2 O 2  treatment on lettuce were evaluated. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions 
         Six VTEC strains were tested in this study:  E. coli  O157:H7 (EDL933) (ATCC 700972), O26:H11 (EC20070549), O103:H2 (EC19970811), O104:H4 (NML#11-3088), O111:NM (EC20070546), and O145:NM (EC19970355).  E. coli  EDL933 was included in the present study because it is prototype O157:H7 strain. Serotypes O26, O103, O111, and O145 are predominant non-O157 serotypes worldwide, therefore strains representing these serotypes have been investigated in this study. In addition VTEC O104:H4 isolated from German outbreak was selected, because this strain is highly virulent and is linked to fresh produce outbreak. All the strains except EDL933 were of human origin.  E. coli  O157:H7 (EDL933) was isolated from raw hamburger meat linked to an outbreak of HC. Further details regarding these strains have been published previously ( Mei et al., 2015 ).  E. coli  O157:H7 (EDL933) possesses genes encoding Stx1 and Stx2, intimin gene ( eae ) and flagellin gene ( fliC ). VTEC O26:H11 (EC20070549) and O103:H2 (EC19970811) do not have  stx2  genes. VTEC strains O111:NM (EC20070546) and O145:NM (EC19970355) do not have genes encoding Stx2 and flagellin. Enteroaggregative  E. coli  strain O104:H4 (NML#113088) does not possess genes encoding Stx1 and intimin. For simplicity, VTEC strains will be referred to by their serotype as each strain has its distinct serotype. All the strains were grown in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 37°C with shaking (180 rpm) for 18 h. Subsequently 0.5 mL of 18 h culture of each VTEC strain was inoculated into 50 mL pre-warmed TSB and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with shaking (180 rpm). The bacterial cells in logarithmic phase were collected, washed twice with sterile distilled water and used to inoculate lettuce samples. 
       
       
         Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of Contaminated Lettuce 
         Romaine lettuce was purchased from a local grocery store in Guelph. The outer leaves were removed and the remaining leaves were cut into 4 × 10 cm slices. Twenty-five grams of the leaves were weighed, placed into sterile polyethylene stomacher bags, and inoculated with 5 mL of bacterial suspension (10 8  CFU/g). The leaves were massaged for 2 min to distribute the bacterial suspension evenly on the leaves. Subsequently, 195 mL of H 2 O 2  was added to the bag to achieve a final concentration of 50 mM. The negative control sample contained lettuce leaves with 5 mL of autoclaved distilled water and 195 mL H 2 O 2 . The non-treated control sample contained 5 mL of bacterial suspension and 195 mL of autoclaved distilled water. The bags were incubated at room temperature for 40 min. After incubation, 1 mL of culture was taken from each stomacher bag and serially diluted with 0.1% (w/v) buffered peptone water. Subsequently, 100 μL of each dilution was spread on cefixime/tellurite—Sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) plates in duplicate. The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C, and the CFU/mL was calculated. Additionally, 4 mL samples from controls and each stomacher bag treated with 50 mM H 2 O 2  were collected for RNA extraction. 
       
       
         RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis 
         Bacterial cells were concentrated by centrifugation before RNA extraction. After taking samples from controls and each stomacher bag treated with 50 mM H 2 O 2 , each 4 mL sample was added to 8 mL (2 volume) of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000× g  and supernatants were decanted prior to RNA extraction. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada), following the manufacturer’s instructions for Gram-negative bacteria. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from each RNA preparation using the Turbo DNA-free TM  kit (Ambion, Cambridge, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions for DNase treatments. Total RNA concentration was determined using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000 (ON, Canada). Subsequently, 0.3 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A no reverse transcriptase control (No RT) was included for each DNase-treated RNA sample. 
       
       
         Real-Time PCR 
         All stress-associated and virulence genes tested in this study are described in  Table  1  . Transcription of key stress and virulence genes ( oxyR ,  sodA ,  soxR ,  uspA ,  rpoS ,  phoA ,  dps ,  cspA ,  cspC ,  cspE ,  gadA ,  gadB ,  gadW ,  mutS  as well as  eae ,  stx1A ,  stx2A , and  fliC ) was evaluated using a comparative real-time PCR. Each 25-μL reaction contained 1 μL of reverse-transcribed cDNA, 12.5 μL of Power SYBR ®  Green PCR Master Mix, 0.25 U AmpErase ®  Uracil  N -Glycosylase (UNG; Applied Biosystems), 2.0 μM of each primer and 6.25 μL nuclease-free water. All primers used in the study were previously described ( Mei et al., 2015 ). Amplification and detection were carried out on a MX3500 ®  Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with an initial temperature of 50°C for 2 min. Following denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, reactions were cycled 40 times as follows: amplification at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s. Subsequent melt curve analysis involved heating the products to 95°C for 1 min, followed by cooling to 55°C for 30 s, and heating to 95°C while monitoring fluorescence. No template control and No RT were included for each assay and no Ct values were obtained for all negative controls after 40 cycles of PCR (data not shown). Several well-known candidate reference genes including 16S rRNA,  tufA/B ,  mdh ,  pyrC ,  gatB ,  recA ,  serC ,  frr ,  rpsU ,  udp ,  mdoG ,  rpoA , and  arcA  were tested for expression stability as previously described ( Mei et al., 2015 ). Only 16S rRNA gene expression was stable in all VTEC strains on lettuce under experimental conditions. Therefore, 16S rRNA was used as reference gene in this study to normalize the data. Serial dilutions of the cDNA template were examined with 16S rRNA primers. Using 50-fold dilutions the Ct value was around 12, and with other primers for different target genes all the Ct values were between 20 and 35. Therefore, 50-fold dilutions of cDNA samples were used in the experiment.

         Statistical Analysis 
         The effect of H 2 O 2  treatment on survival and gene transcription of VTEC strains present on lettuce was investigated by at least three independent experiments. Each biological sample was run in duplicate on real-time RT PCR. Relative mRNA levels were determined according to the method described by  Hellemans et al. (2007) . Gene transcription data were analyzed using Student’s  t -test. Data on reduction of VTEC populations on lettuce following exposure to H 2 O 2  were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. 
       
     
     
       Results 
       Treatment of contaminated lettuce with 50 mM H 2 O 2  for 40 min reduced the populations of all VTEC strains tested in this study by 2.4–2.8 log 10  ( Table  2  ). The differences in sensitivity to H 2 O 2  treatment on lettuce between VTEC O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes were not statistically significant ( P  &gt; 0.05).

       In addition, the influence of H 2 O 2  treatment on stress and virulence gene transcription of six VTEC strains on romaine lettuce was investigated. This study focused on well-known virulence genes including genes encoding intimin ( eae ), Stx genes  stx1A  and  stx2A  and flagellin genes ( fliC ) ( Figures  1  –  6  ). Transcription of key stress-associated genes such as genes involved in response to oxidative damage ( oxyR ,  sodA , and  soxR ), general stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), and starvation ( phoA  and  dps ) was investigated. The study also focused on the effects of H 2 O 2  treatment of contaminated lettuce on transcription of acid stress genes ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ), cold shock ( cspA ,  cspC , and  cspE ), and gene related to UV radiation stress ( mutS ) ( Figures  1  –  6  ). A fold change cutoff of 1.5 was applied in this study.

       In  E. coli  O157:H7 present on lettuce, the genes associated with oxidative stress ( oxyR  and  sodA ), universal stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid stress ( gadB  and  gadW ), and virulence ( stx1A ,  stx2A , and  fliC ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulated after exposure to 50 mM H 2 O 2 . The  gadA  gene was downregulated 1.9-fold and the expression of  soxR  was below the detectable level. Interestingly, two genes related to cold shock ( cspC  and  cspE ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated. Genes related to starvation ( dps ), cold shock ( cspA ), and mismatch repair (MMR;  mutS ) were also upregulated ( Figure  1  ). 
       In the case of  E. coli  O104:H4 on lettuce, H 2 O 2  treatment caused significant ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulation of genes related to oxidative stress ( oxyR  and  sodA ), general stress ( rpoS ), acid resistance ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ), and virulence ( stx2A  and  fliC ). The  uspA  gene was also downregulated. Transcription of  dps ,  cspC , and  mutS  was significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated. In addition, gene encoding cold shock protein ( cspE ) was upregulated ( Figure  2  ). 
       In  E. coli  O145:NM present on lettuce, genes related to oxidative damage ( sodA ), general stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid resistance ( gadA  and  gadW ), and virulence ( stx1A ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulated. The  soxR  and  gadB  genes were also downregulated. Only two genes ( dps  and  cspE ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated. Furthermore, genes encoding cold shock protein ( cspC ), MMR sensor ( mutS ), and intimin ( eae ) were upregulated ( Figure  3  ). 
       In  E. coli  O111:NM on lettuce, nine genes, responsible for oxidative damage ( oxyR  and  sodA ), general stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid resistance ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ) and virulence ( stx1A ), were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulated. Whereas, genes for cold shock ( cspC ) and MMR ( mutS ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated ( Figure  4  ). 
       In  E. coli  O26:H11 present on lettuce, 9 out of 17 genes, including genes associated with oxidative damage ( oxyR  and  sodA ), general stress ( uspA  and  rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid resistance ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ), and virulence ( eae ,  stx1A , and  fliC ), were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulated. Three genes,  dps  (starvation-related),  cspC  and  cspE  (cold shock-related), were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated. In addition, genes for cold shock ( cspA ) and DNA damage repair ( mutS ) were upregulated ( Figure  5  ). 
       In  E. coli  O103:H2 on lettuce, genes related to oxidative stress ( oxyR  and  sodA ), general stress ( rpoS ), starvation ( phoA ), acid resistance ( gadW ), and virulence ( stx1A  and  fliC ) were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) downregulated. In addition, two genes associated with acid resistance— gadA  and  gadB , as well as  uspA  gene were downregulated. Interestingly,  soxR  and  cspC , were significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) upregulated. Genes encoding cold shock protein ( cspA  and  cspE ), and intimin ( eae ) were also upregulated ( Figure  6  ). 
       Overall, most of the genes associated with stress and virulence were downregulated in O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes on lettuce treated with 50 mM H 2 O 2 . Only three genes, associated with cold shock ( cspC  and  cspE ) and MMR ( mutS ), were upregulated in all VTEC strains tested ( Figures  1  –  6  ). 
     
     
       Discussion 
       The effect of H 2 O 2  on the survival on lettuce of six VTEC strains, representing O26:H11, O103:H2, O104:H4, O111:NM, O145:NM, and O157:H7 serotypes, was investigated in this study. A population reduction of 2.4–2.8 log 10  was observed for all VTEC strains on lettuce following treatment with 50 mM H 2 O 2  ( Table  1  ). A previous study in our laboratory, using the same VTEC strains suspended in TSB, reported greater sensitivity to H 2 O 2 . For instance treatment, of pure broth culture of VTEC O104:H4 with 1 mM H 2 O 2  resulted in a 2.7 log reduction and 2.5 mM H 2 O 2  caused a 3.7 log reduction in population of  E. coli  O104:H4 ( Tang and Kostrzynska, 2012 ). Therefore, the results derived from these studies demonstrate that H 2 O 2  treatment is less effective in lettuce decontamination compared to its effect on reducing VTEC populations in pure cultures. Previous investigations showed that several factors, such as organic loads of fresh-cut produce ( Gonzalez et al., 2004 ), whole- or cut-leaf wash ( Nou and Luo, 2010 ), and leaf age ( Brandl and Amundson, 2008 ), can influence the efficacy of sanitizer to inactivate  E. coli  O157:H7 on fresh produce. These studies indicate that the lettuce leaves may help to protect bacteria, making it harder to eliminate pathogens from fresh-cut lettuce. Indeed, bacterial cells on lettuce may be physically sequestered from H 2 O 2  exposure. In addition, organic molecules released by fresh-cut lettuce will react with H 2 O 2  and therefore reduce the effective exposure to H 2 O 2 . Therefore, in order to choose an effective treatment to reduce the pathogens on leafy greens, it is important to understand the behavior of bacteria on lettuce under different stress conditions. 
       To get a better understanding of the response to H 2 O 2  treatment in different VTEC serotypes, in the present study, the transcription of genes related to stress and virulence in O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes on lettuce was evaluated. Different gene transcription profiles following exposure to H 2 O 2  were observed in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures ( Mei et al., 2015 ). H 2 O 2  caused dramatic downregulation of stress-associated and virulence genes in VTEC strains present on lettuce, including O157 and non-157 serotypes. Ten genes were downregulated in all six VTEC strains on lettuce ( Figures  1  –  6  ). However, only three genes were upregulated. These genes belong to different regulation systems in  E. coli  and respond to various environmental conditions by adjusting behavior accordingly to protect cells from damaging. 
       
         Anti-Oxidant System Response ( oxyR ,  sodA , and  soxR ) 
         Superoxide dismutases (SODs) and catalases are employed by  E. coli  to respond to superoxide and peroxide stress. There are three SODs, including MnSOD ( sodA ), FeSOD (sodB), and CuZnSOD (sodC), and two catalases (HPI and HPII, encoded by  katG  and  katE , respectively) in  E. coli . These SODs and catalase genes are regulated by two major oxidative stress regulons, OxyR and SoxRS ( Chiang and Schellhorn, 2012 ). In the presence of oxidative stress, OxyR can sense H 2 O 2  and be converted to the oxidized form, subsequently activating transcription of the OxyR regulon genes, such as  katG ,  dps , and  oxyR , which protect the cell from H 2 O 2  toxicity ( Storz et al., 1990a ;  Farr and Kogoma, 1991 ;  Chiang and Schellhorn, 2012 ). In this study, the transcription of  oxyR  was downregulated in all VTEC strains ( Figures  1 – 6  ), this may cause a reduction in catalase expression, increasing peroxide sensitivity. 
         SoxRS is another key regulon triggered under oxidative stress in  E. coli . It is positively regulated by superoxide-generating agents such as paraquat and constitutes a two-stage regulatory system, in which SoxR, activated as a transcriptional activator, induces the expression of  soxS  and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein regulate the transcription of the various genes important for responding to oxidative stress ( Demple and Amabile-Cuevas, 1991 ;  Nunoshiba et al., 1992 ;  Chiang and Schellhorn, 2012 ). The genes controlled by  soxRS  include  sodA  (Mn-containing SOD),  nfo  (DNA repair endonuclease IV),  micF  (antisense regulator of  ompF ), and  zwf  (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) ( Christman et al., 1985 ;  Greenberg et al., 1990 ;  Tsaneva and Weiss, 1990 ). In the present study, following exposure of VTEC strains on lettuce to 50 mM H 2 O 2 , the transcription of  soxR  in  E. coli  O103:H2 slightly increased (1.5-fold), whereas, the transcription of  soxR  decreased to below the detectable level in O157:H7. Therefore, SodA reduction may be attributed to the reduction or only slight induction of soxR.  Manchado et al. (2000)  reported that the expression of OxyR-regulated genes ( katG  and  dps ) were induced when the concentration of H 2 O 2  was from 1 to 100 μM, while the higher concentration (≥500 μM H 2 O 2 ) resulted in the upregulation of  soxS  and  sodA . That study suggests that the expression of  oxyR  or  soxRS  is dose-dependent. In addition, downregulation of soxR was also observed in VTEC broth cultures exposed to oxidative stress ( Mei et al., 2015 ), however, the transcription of  sodA  was significantly ( P  ≤ 0.05) increased in pure cultures of all VTEC strains. The inconsistent results of expression of  soxR  and  sodA  may indicate that (1) sodA can react to superoxide stress independently; (2) SoxRS is not the sole regulator of  sodA  gene. 
       
       
         General Stress Response ( uspA  and  rpoS ) and Cold Shock Response ( cspA ,  cspC , and  cspE ) 
          Escherichia coli  contains a large CspA family, consisting of nine homologous cold inducible proteins, CspA to CspI, among which, CspA is the major one produced at 10–24°C, and is negatively downregulated by cspC. Whereas, CspC and CspE are constitutively produced at 37°C and are not temperature regulated ( Yamanaka et al., 1994 ;  Etchegaray et al., 1996 ;  Phadtare and Inouye, 2001 ). It has been reported that CspC and CspE are important regulators of the expression of RpoS, a global stress response regulator, and UspA,  u niversal  s tress  p rotein A responding to various general stresses ( Nystrom and Neidhardt, 1992 ,  1994 ). In addition, RpoS-controlled genes such as  dps  and  katG  are upregulated or downregulated by the overexpression or deletion of  cspC  and  cspE  ( Phadtare and Inouye, 2001 ;  Phadtare et al., 2006 ). Therefore, CspC and CspE play important roles in the stress response of  E. coli . Upregulation of  cspC  and  cspE  in all six VTEC strains on lettuce was observed in the present study ( Figures  1  –  6  ). However,  uspA  and  rpoS  were downregulated, and a minor change in the transcription of  dps  was observed. Interestingly, the transcription of  cspC  was downregulated in broth cultures of all VTEC strains exposed to 2.5 mM H 2 O 2  at 37°C ( Mei et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, in the present study  cspC  was upregulated in VTEC strains on lettuce treated with 50 mM H 2 O 2  at room temperature. Previous investigation showed that CspC and CspE cannot be induced under some stress conditions, like 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M KCl, 5% ethanol, pH 10, pH 4, temperature of 15 or 50°C ( Phadtare and Inouye, 2001 ). It is possible that a different concentration of H 2 O 2  used for lettuce decontamination as well as environmental factors such as H 2 O 2  released from fresh-cut lettuce leaves as well as nutrients present in lettuce samples and natural microbiota contributed to the induction of  cspC  and  cspE . More interestingly, contrary results of transcription of  cspC  and  cspE  observed in response to H 2 O 2  treatment of VTEC pure cultures and in the same strains present on lettuce, suggest that VTEC may react to the same stress differently in different environments. However, it is not possible to rule out that induction of cold stress genes in present study was more of the effect of temperature change combined with peroxide treatment. Centrifugation of bacterial cells using refrigerated centrifuge, following VTEC exposure on lettuce to H 2 O 2  could influence transcription of cold shock genes. Further studies are required to gain a better understanding of the stress conditions that affect the  cspC  and  cspE  gene transcription in VTEC present on lettuce. 
       
       
         Starvation Stress Response ( phoA  and  dps ) 
         The gene  phoA , encoding alkaline phosphatase, was induced under a phosphate-limited condition, but was not synthesized in normal growth medium ( Han and Lee, 2006 ). The  phoA  is a member of  pho  regulon, regulated by a two-protein system PhoR–PhoP ( Sola-Landa et al., 2003 ). The  phoA  was significantly downregulated in all the VTEC strains on lettuce tested in this study ( Figures  1  –  6  ). Furthermore, downregulation of  phoA  was observed in most VTEC strains when pure cultures were treated with H 2 O 2  ( Mei et al., 2015 ). Therefore, further studies are needed to test, if H 2 O 2  treatment changes the sensitivity of VTEC strains to phosphate-limited condition. 
         The H 2 O 2  can cause lethality of the bacterial cells through several mechanisms. It has been proposed that the primary cause of cell inactivation by H 2 O 2  or other oxidative agents is DNA damage ( Storz et al., 1990b ). Thus, it is important for the cells to cope with stresses by inducing the production of a variety of DNA repair enzymes as well as catalases. Glutathione also acts to protect cells from oxidative stress. In addition, Dps—the  D NA binding  p rotein from  s tarved cells, protects cells during environmental stresses, including oxidative stress and nutritional deprivation ( Almiron et al., 1992 ;  Calhoun and Kwon, 2011 ). Dps protects cells from harmful oxidative radicals by DNA binding, iron storage, and by binding and oxidizing Fe ions at ferroxidase centers. Furthermore, Dps may regulate the expression of DNA repair enzymes and catalases necessary for stress resistance.  Zheng et al. (2001)  reported that the expression of  dps  considerably increased when the cells were exposed to 1 mM H 2 O 2  for 10 min. However, only minor upregulation of  dps  was observed in this study for most of VTEC strains on lettuce ( Figures  1  –  6  ). 
       
       
         Mismatch Repair Response ( mutS ) 
         MutS is a member of methylation-dependent MMR system which helps to maintain chromosome stability in  E. coli . MutS binds to the mismatches and initiates the long-patch MMR on daughter DNA strands ( Modrich and Lahue, 1996 ;  Schofield and Hsieh, 2003 ). MMR has also been shown to be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage which causes spontaneous lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG or GO;  Michaels and Miller, 1992 ;  Tchou and Grollman, 1993 ;  Lu et al., 2001 ). Studies have shown that the amount of MutS in  E. coli  remarkably decreased when cells were in the stationary phase and under starvation stress and the expression of MutS repair protein was negatively regulated by the RpoS and Hfq global regulators ( Feng et al., 1996 ;  Tsui et al., 1997 ;  Li et al., 2003 ). In the present study,  mutS  was upregulated following exposure of VTEC on lettuce to H 2 O 2  ( Figures  1  –  6  ). This upregulation may be caused by significantly downregulated expression of RpoS, which is a negative regulator of  mutS . 
       
       
         Acid Response ( gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW ) 
         Food-borne pathogenic  E. coli  must be able to survive in the extremely acidic environment of the stomach and resist very low pH (1.5–3.0) for several hours ( Peterson et al., 1989 ). Previous studies have shown that a total of 12 genes comprise an acid fitness island, including a glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system and three transcriptional regulators (GadE, GadX, and GadW) of the GAD enzymes, which renders  E. coli  the ability to survive strong acidic stress ( Hommais et al., 2001 ,  2004 ;  Ma et al., 2002 ;  Bergholz et al., 2007 ;  Mates et al., 2007 ).  E. coli  produce two isozymes of GAD encoded by the  gadA  and  gadB  genes, which are induced by GadX at any pH, while GadW represses expression of  gadX . GadW activates the expression of  gadA  and  gadB  only in the absence of GadX ( Ma et al., 2002 ;  Tucker et al., 2003 ). In addition, it has been reported that the expression of  gadA  and  gadBC  were induced when bacteria were cultured in acidified medium, treated with acetate, and during entry into stationary phase ( Selinger et al., 2000 ;  Arnold et al., 2001 ;  Tucker et al., 2002 ). However, the expression of regulators GadX and GadW, under the same conditions, were unknown. In the present study,  gadA ,  gadB , and  gadW  were significantly downregulated in all six VTEC strains on lettuce ( Figures  1  –  6  ). We suspect that the expression of  gadX  was also downregulated in response to H 2 O 2 , which subsequently resulted in the downregulation of  gadA  and  gadB . Furthermore, the results indicate that following H 2 O 2  treatment, VTEC on lettuce may become more sensitive to acid stress, which decreases the viability of pathogens under low pH. 
       
       
         Virulence Factors (Encoded by  eae ,  stx1A ,  stx2A , and  fliC  Genes) 
         Production of Stx is the definitive virulence factor of VTEC O157:H7 and non-O157 serotypes ( Croxen et al., 2013 ;  Scheutz, 2014 ;  Smith et al., 2014 ;  Franz et al., 2015 ). Stx produced by VTEC can be classified into two types Stx1 and Stx2. There are three subtypes of Stx1 (a, c, d) and seven subtypes of Stx2 (a, b, c, d, e, f, g). Although both toxins could cause bloody diarrhea and HUS, a specific subset of  stx2  subtypes ( stx2a ,  stx2c , and  stx2d ) have a higher association with HC and HUS than  stx1  subtypes or other  stx2  subtypes ( Scheutz, 2014 ). Stx are encoded on bacteriophage genomes that are integrated into bacterial chromosome. As such, the biology of the Stx-encoding phages influences the expression of  stx1  and  stx2 . Production and release of toxins depend on induction of these bacteriophages ( Croxen et al., 2013 ;  Scheutz, 2014 ). Amongst the VTEC strains tested in this study,  E. coli  O157:H7 produced both Stx1 and Stx2,  E. coli  O104:H4 produced only Stx2, and the remaining four strains produced only Stx1. In this study, both  stx1A  and  stx2A  genes were dramatically downregulated in all VTEC strains on lettuce following exposure to H 2 O 2  ( Figures  1  –  6  ). 
         Many VTEC strains produce attaching and effacing (AE) lesions, which are controlled by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE;  Croxen et al., 2013 ;  Scheutz, 2014 ). Although AE lesions are not essential for bloody diarrhea and HUS, the majority of strains implicated in these syndromes are LEE-positive. Intimin, encoded by  eae  ( E. coli  attaching and effacing) gene, is responsible for intimate adhesion of VTEC to the intestinal epithelium and formation of AE lesions. Intimin binds to the cell receptor Tir, which is translocated by the pathogen to the enterocyte via a type III secretion system ( Croxen et al., 2013 ). The presence of  eae  gene is strongly correlated to the presence of genes encoding many other virulence factors ( Franz et al., 2015 ). In addition, VTEC strains with  eae  and  stx2  genes have been associated with HUS and bloody diarrhea ( Scheutz, 2014 ). In the present study, the transcription of  eae  (except for  E. coli  O104:H4 which is LEE-negative) changed only slightly following H 2 O 2  treatment ( Figures  1  –  6  ). Thus, further studies about  eae  regulation and the intimin-related virulence of VTEC strains under different stress conditions are needed. 
         Production of flagella is another contributor to the pathogenicity of VTEC ( Gyles, 2007 ). Flagella are mainly responsible for motility, chemotaxis, and secretion of virulence factors. The key structural component of the flagellum filament is encoded by the  fliC  gene. In our studies, the transcription of  fliC  was dramatically downregulated in all four motile VTEC strains on lettuce treated with H 2 O 2  ( Figures  1  –  6  ). In addition,  fliC  was downregulated in pure broth cultures exposed to H 2 O 2  ( Mei et al., 2015 ). These results suggest that H 2 O 2  treatment affects motility of VTEC strains. 
       
     
     
       Conclusion 
       H 2 O 2  treatment caused less dramatic reduction in VTEC populations on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures, which indicates that VTEC are protected from H 2 O 2  on leafy greens. Consequently higher concentration of H 2 O 2  or other sanitizers are required to reduce and eliminate VTEC on lettuce. As such, the results derived from this study showed the importance of food matrix in studying the effect of sanitizers on survival rate of VTEC. In addition, VTEC strains on lettuce showed similar transcription patterns (regardless of serotype) in response to treatment with 50 mM H 2 O 2.  The transcription of genes related to oxidative stress, general stress, acid stress and some virulence genes were significantly downregulated in six VTEC serotypes. Consequently, VTEC strains on lettuce may become more sensitive to acid stress following H 2 O 2  treatment. Interestingly, different gene transcription patterns in response to H 2 O 2  were observed in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures ( Mei et al., 2015 ). Particularly,  sodA  gene encoding manganese SOD was significantly upregulated in pure cultures of all VTEC serotypes, however, this gene was downregulated in the same strains present on lettuce. In addition, Stx genes were upregulated in broth culture of  E. coli  O157:H7 and downregulated in most VTEC serotypes (including O157:H7) on lettuce following H 2 O 2  treatment. It is possible that factors released from fresh-cut lettuce leaves and natural microbiota present in lettuce samples contributed to different gene transcription patterns in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to broth cultures.

         Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle paralysis determined by the degeneration of motoneurons in the motor cortex brainstem and spinal cord. The ALS pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclear, despite the wealth of studies demonstrating the involvement of several altered signaling pathways, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. To date, the proposed therapeutic strategies are targeted to one or a few of these alterations, resulting in only a minimal effect on disease course and survival of ALS patients. The involvement of different mechanisms in ALS pathogenesis underlines the need for a therapeutic approach targeted to multiple aspects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can support motoneurons and surrounding cells, reduce inflammation, stimulate tissue regeneration and release growth factors. On this basis, MSC have been proposed as promising candidates to treat ALS. However, due to the drawbacks of cell therapy, the possible therapeutic use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by stem cells is raising increasing interest. The present review summarizes the main pathological mechanisms involved in ALS and the related therapeutic approaches proposed to date, focusing on MSC therapy and their preclinical and clinical applications. Moreover, the nature and characteristics of EVs and their role in recapitulating the effect of stem cells are discussed, elucidating how and why these vesicles could provide novel opportunities for ALS treatment.

       Introduction 
       Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, first described by the neurobiologist Jean-Martin Charcot in the 1870s and which became initially known as Charcot’s sclerosis. In the USA, the disease is also known as Lou Gehrig disease, in honor of the baseball player who developed the disease in the 1930s. ALS has an incidence of 2–3/100,000 and a prevalence of 6–7/100,000 in Europe (Costa and de Carvalho,  2016 ), making it the most common motoneuron disease in human adults (Cleveland and Rothstein,  2001 ). In 90%–95% of cases there is no apparent genetic link (sporadic ALS, sALS), while the remaining 5%–10% of cases have a family history (familial ALS, fALS). 
       In general, the first symptoms appear at the mean age of 50 years for fALS, and 60 years for sALS, even if the onset can occur in very young individuals or in elderly people (Costa and de Carvalho,  2016 ). The disease is more common in males than in females, with an incidence of 1.5:1 (Zarei et al.,  2015 ), although the incidence in men and women is about the same in fALS. The disease is fatal within 2–5 years after clinical onset; about 50% of patients die within 30 months from symptom onset, while about 10% of patients may survive for more than a decade (Forsgren et al.,  1983 ; del Aguila et al.,  2003 ). 
       Both sALS and fALS are characterized by selective degeneration of both upper motoneurons in the primary motor cortex, and lower motoneurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. However, some groups of motoneurons, including those that control pelvic muscles (Onuf’s nucleus in the sacral spinal cord) and eye movements (oculomotoneurons), are spared by the pathology. The reasons of this differential motoneuron vulnerability remain unknown (Comley et al.,  2015 ). 
       The familial and sporadic forms of the disease appear clinically indistinguishable. Although the motoneuron degeneration is the main hallmark of the disease, ALS can be classified according to the district of symptom onset. Limb onset is the most common presentation of ALS, with progressive muscle weakness and wasting, body weight loss, fasciculations, emotional lability and cognitive dysfunction. In the bulbar onset, representing approximately 30% of ALS cases, the disease starts with difficulties in speech and swallowing (dysarthria and dysphagia), followed by limb symptoms (Pratt et al.,  2012 ). 
       In sALS, the occurrence of the disease could be also due to a gene-environment interaction; sALS has been associated with “susceptibility” genes, that may trigger the cascade of neurodegeneration interacting with environmental risk factors. Susceptibility genes could also play a role in fALS, (Zufiría et al.,  2016 ). Mutations in susceptibility genes could potentially contribute to the development of the disease only in the presence of other genetic or environmental factors. In persons with a susceptibility genotype, the exposure to specific environmental risk factors may increase the risk for the disease. 
       Concerning genetic predisposition, epigenetics, and in particular defects in histone homeostasis (acetylation and deacetylation), have been implicated in ALS. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze acetylation and deacetylation, respectively, of histone proteins Lys residues. The interplay between HATs and HDACs alters the net balance of histone acetylation levels, thereby remodeling chromatin structure, as indicated by transcriptional dysregulation that occurs in both ALS murine models and patients (Janssen et al.,  2010 ). Although a role of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of ALS has been documented, it remains to be clarified whether the involved epigenetic alterations could be related to environmental factors. 
       Among the risk factors for ALS, lifestyle, including smoking and dietary factors, and physical activity have been hypothesized. In particular, some ALS patients have a higher level of physical fitness and a lower body mass index compared with healthy controls (Armon,  2003 ; Turner,  2013 ). Moreover, environmental risk factors combined with working conditions (construction workers, carpenters, farm workers, laboratory technicians and athletes) could potentially increase the risk for ALS due to exposure to heavy metals, solvents, pesticides and chemicals which could contribute to trigger ALS pathogenetic mechanisms (Ingre et al.,  2015 ). 
       In a geographical area which includes part of Japan, Guam, Kii Peninsula of Japan and Guinea the prevalence of the disease is 50–100 times higher than in any other part of the world. This increased incidence is ascribed to exposure to a neurotoxic amino acid, β-methylamino-L-alanine, as indicated by the higher concentration of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord tissues of ALS patients than in healthy controls (Pablo et al.,  2009 ). 
       Viral infections have also been considered as a potential risk factor for ALS: exposure to viruses such as enterovirus, herpesvirus and retrovirus may play an important role in the disease, as reported in studies of blood, serum, muscle and post-mortem brain tissue of ALS patients. In these tissues a significant increase of the expression of the virus and the ability to form virus-like particles were revealed (Berger et al.,  2000 ; Oluwole et al.,  2007 ; Alfahad and Nath,  2013 ). 
       Another important factor to consider is the relationship between ALS and other medical conditions. Several studies suggest a strong association of head trauma, metabolic diseases, autoimmune pathology and neuroinflammation (Chen et al.,  2007 ; Turner et al.,  2013 ). 
       Altogether these data point to a substantial impact of non-genetic factors on ALS. The identification and knowledge of these factors would be highly relevant for understanding the etiopathogenesis of the sporadic form of the disease in persons with a susceptibility genotype. 
       About 5%–10% of ALS is familial, with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner, although in most affected families it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with fALS present an earlier age of onset compared to the sporadic form, and the penetrance, severity, progression and duration of disease vary in different gene mutations and different mutations in the same gene (Chen et al.,  2013 ). 
       More than 20 gene mutations have been identified in fALS, which include: Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), fused in sarcoma (FUS)/translocated in sarcoma and ubiquitin 2 (Kaur et al.,  2016 ). It has been recently reported that the hexarepeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) is the most common inherited cause of fALS (40% of cases; Zufiría et al.,  2016 ). 
       Mutations in the SOD1 gene were the first to be identified in ALS: they occur in up to 20% of fALS cases and in 1%–4% of sALS cases and, to date, more than 150 mutations have been found (Chen et al.,  2013 ). Three different isoform of SOD metalloenzymes are encoded in the human genome: the cytoplasmic Cu/Zn SOD (SOD1), the mitochondrial Mn SOD (SOD2) and the extracellular Cu/Zn SOD (SOD3). Each isoform is a product of distinct genes and has a distinct subcellular localization, but all require metals for their activity and catalyze the same reaction: the dismutation of toxic superoxide anion radical (O 2  − ), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a single unpaired electron produced by cellular respiration, into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The toxicity of H 2 O 2  is then removed by glutathione peroxidase or catalase, which generates water and oxygen. Therefore, SODs enzymes provide an important antioxidant defense in cells exposed to oxygen (Fukai and Ushio-Fukai,  2011 ). 
       The human SOD1 isoform, whose gene is located on chromosome 21 (locus 21q22.1), is a small gene consisting of five exons and four introns encoding for a homodimeric enzyme, each monomer formed by 153 amino acids (15.8 kDa) which form eight antiparallel beta strands. The protein contains one copper and one zinc atom: the first is fundamental for SOD1 activity, while zinc plays a role in the structural stability of the enzyme (Rosen et al.,  1993 ). 
       The SOD1 mutations can be localized on the beta strand, determining structural protein instability, or in the metal-binding sites, determining the lack of Cu and/or Zn, conformational dysfunction and alteration of protein interactions. In both instances, the destabilization of the structure can lead to the formation of aggregates (Kaur et al.,  2016 ). 
       The majority of SOD1 mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant form of the disease (ALS1) and G93A, alanine at codon 4 changed to valine (A4V), H46R and D90A are the most commonly reported ALS mutations. The G93A mutation (glycine 93 changed to alanine) is a rare mutation, but is the most studied as it was the first to be used in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. The A4V is the most prevalent mutation in the USA and D90A (aspartic acid at codon 90 changed to alanine) is the most common in Europe (with either dominant or recessive inheritance). 
       Gene mutations can cause a dominant gain of function, resulting in an increase of SOD1 activity, with an excessive production of H 2 O 2 , or in a dominant loss of function with a decrease in enzyme activity which results in insufficient degradation of ROS (Kaur et al.,  2016 ). 
       The main pathogenetic mechanisms involved in motoneuron degeneration in ALS and the main therapeutic strategies proposed to date are here summarized. This review article also focuses on the application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as treatment for ALS, reporting results obtained in  in vivo  models of the disease and in clinical trials. Moreover, extracellular vesicles (EVs) as possible mediators of a therapeutic effect of stem cells will be discussed, underlying their potential use for ALS treatment. 
     
     
       Pathogenetic Mechanisms in ALS 
       The identification of molecular mechanisms by which motoneurons degenerate in ALS is crucial for understanding disease progression and for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Although SOD1 mutations have been linked to ALS since more than two decades, the mechanisms underlying the mode of action of mutant SOD1 and the subsequent neurodegeneration/neurotoxicity are still unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed in this regards and it seems likely that the combination of mechanisms, rather than a single mechanism, contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS, pointing to a multifactorial pathogenesis (Figure  1 ). 
       
         Figure 1 
         
            Pathogenetic mechanisms involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  The pathophysiological mechanism of the disease appears to be multifactorial and several mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration. An increase of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the synaptic cleft (glutamate excitotoxicity), due to the impairment of its uptake by astrocytes, leads to an increased influx of Ca 2+  ions in the motoneurons. The increased levels of Ca 2+  ions, which in physiological conditions could be removed by mitochondria (calcium homeostasis), remain high in the cytoplasm due to mitochondrial dysfunction and can cause neurodegeneration through activation of Ca 2+ -dependent enzymatic pathways contributing to oxidative stress. Mutant misfolding proteins (such as superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) form intercellular aggregates, contribute to an increase of oxidative stress, contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and could lead to the accumulation of neurofilaments (NFs) and dysfunction of axonal transport. Moreover, activated astrocyte and microglia release inflammatory mediators and toxic factors, contributing to neurotoxicity. 
         
         
       
       
         Mitochondrial Dysfunction 
         Mitochondrial damage is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are the most important organelles for energy production, cellular respiration and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, they produce high level of ROS and play a key role in apoptosis, opening the permeability transition pore and allowing the release of cytochrome c, which leads to the activation of the caspase cascade. For these reasons, structural and biochemical alterations of mitochondria can be linked to many aspects of ALS pathogenesis. 
         Morphological alterations in mitochondria, such as vacuolated and dilated organelle with disorganized cristae and membranes, fragmented network and swelling, were observed in spinal motoneurons and skeletal muscle of both sALS and fALS patients and in the murine model of the disease (SOD1(G93A) mice; Boillée et al.,  2006a ; Sasaki and Iwata,  2007 ; Magrané and Manfredi,  2009 ). The formation of vacuoles is due to expansion of the mitochondrial intermembrane space and consequent distention of membranes (Higgins et al.,  2003 ). 
         Although the mitochondria have own SOD protein (SOD2), the cytoplasmic SOD protein (SOD1) is also present, at low levels, in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and in their matrix (Bergemalm et al.,  2006 ). The deposit of misfolded mutant SOD1 in mitochondria may alter the physiological function of these organelles in the cell metabolism. Abnormal production of ATP and ROS, dysfunction in energy homeostasis and calcium homeostasis, alteration of apoptosis triggering, as well as altered mitochondrial transport along axons have been reported in ALS transgenic mice and patients (Pasinelli et al.,  2000 ; Mattiazzi et al.,  2002 ; Menzies et al.,  2002 ; Damiano et al.,  2006 ). Concerning energy homeostasis and ATP deficits, mutant SOD1 causes a decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes I and IV which are associated with defective energy metabolism (Wiedemann et al.,  1998 ). Another key function of mitochondria concerns the regulation of cytosolic calcium levels: several studies reported a loss of Ca 2+  binding proteins in motoneurons of ALS patients related to the presence of mutant SOD1 (Bernard-Marissal et al.,  2012 ; Mattson,  2013 ), which leads to reduced calcium uptake from the cytoplasm, increasing the sensitivity to excitotoxicity. 
         Moreover, mitochondria are required in areas with high demand of ATP and calcium homeostasis, such as synaptic terminals. Therefore, transport of mitochondria to these areas is of primary importance, and defects in mitochondrial axonal transport lead to metabolic alterations in neurons (Magrané and Manfredi,  2009 ; Mòrotz et al.,  2012 ). 
         Altered protein expression in mutant mitochondria has also been reported (Fukada et al.,  2004 ; Kirby et al.,  2005 ; Lukas et al.,  2006 ). Since the majority of proteins required for the function of this organelle are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported in the mitochondria, mutant SOD1 associated to the mitochondrial surface could prevent protein import (Liu et al.,  2004 ). 
       
       
         Glutamate Excitotoxicity 
         Glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal and diffuses across the synaptic cleft, activating specific postsynaptic receptors and triggering action potentials. This neurotransmitter acts on different receptors on the dendrites of the postsynaptic motoneuron, such as α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The depolarization of neuronal membranes after activation of neuronal glutamate receptors activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, allowing calcium to enter the cell. 
         After release from the presynaptic neuron, glutamate is removed from the synaptic cleft by several glial and neuronal cell transporter proteins, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs; Sundaram et al.,  2012 ). The concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is thus finely regulated, avoiding excitotoxicity: an excessive or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors results in degeneration and eventually death of the involved neurons (Shaw and Eggett,  2000 ). A sustained elevation of intracellular calcium levels triggers enzymatic and mitochondrial damages that lead to the formation of ROS and activates several destructive biochemical processes, determining excitatory damage and neuronal degeneration (Ilieva et al.,  2009 ; Vucic et al.,  2014 ). Therefore, the rapid removal of glutamate is required to prevent neuronal toxicity. In particular, the isoform 2 of the astroglial glutamate transporter (EAAT2) is involved in keeping the amount of glutamate below excitotoxic level in the nervous system. 
         Before the identification of the genetic links of fALS, glutamate excitotoxicity was one of the first hypotheses proposed as pathogenetic mechanism of ALS (Bendotti and Carrì,  2004 ). The motor cortex and spinal cord of ALS patients and transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse models were found to have reduced EAAT2 level, probably due to the presence of aberrant EAAT2 mRNA or to cleavage of the EAAT2 transporter. This leads to an increase of synaptic glutamate concentration and an over-stimulation of glutamate postsynaptic receptors, determining excitotoxic neuronal degeneration (Lin et al.,  1998 ; Zarei et al.,  2015 ). The loss of functional EAAT2 was also observed in affected brain regions of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (Guo et al.,  2003 ). To establish whether loss of functional EAAT2 in ALS was a primary cause of neuron degeneration or a consequence of cell damage, transgenic mutant SOD1 mice overexpressing EAAT2 (EAAT2/G93A double transgenic mice) were generated to investigate whether supplementation of EAAT2 loss would delay or rescue the disease. Mice with an increased EAAT2 expression showed a delay in motoneuron degeneration and disease progression. Since no change in lifespan was found comparing EAAT2/G93A mice with SOD1(G93A) mice, it was concluded that loss of EAAT2 may contribute to motoneuron degeneration in ALS but is not the principal cause (Guo et al.,  2003 ). 
         Moreover, the selective vulnerability of motoneurons in ALS may be due to a higher permeability to calcium of these cells compared with other neurons, probably caused by a defect in RNA editing of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA, which renders this receptor more permeable to calcium (Kawahara et al.,  2004 ). 
       
       
         Oxidative Stress 
         Free radicals or ROS are natural products of oxygen metabolism. The term oxidative stress is used when the production of ROS is higher than the capacity of cells to remove them. This leads to the accumulation of ROS, which causes irreversible damage to cell structures and macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA and RNA. 
         SOD1 is the major enzyme to prevent oxidative damage and to reduce superoxide leakage from mitochondria. Mutations in this gene can cause alterations in the activity of the protein leading to cytotoxicity. 
         Early studies suggested that mutations in the SOD1 gene cause a complete loss of protein function (Deng et al.,  1993 ). Subsequently,  in vitro  experiments demonstrated that mutant human SOD1 proteins (such as the G37R mutation) are active and stable, promoting neural apoptosis in a dominant manner (Borchelt et al.,  1994 ; Rabizadeh et al.,  1995 ). These studies suggest ALS pathogenesis may involve not only a decrease/loss in the enzymatic function of SOD1, but is also probably due to a dominant toxic gain of function of the enzyme. It has been proposed that mutant SOD1 could revert its normal antioxidant activity producing toxic superoxide: the mutated protein could take electrons from other cellular antioxidants and donate them to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide and making SOD1 the source of oxidative stress (Beckman et al.,  2001 ; Liochev and Fridovich,  2003 ). Increased levels of free radicals and of oxidative damage were found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and urine samples of ALS patients (Zarei et al.,  2015 ) and could be due to an altered geometry in the active site of the mutated SOD1, which allows entry of reducing substrates. 
         Oxidative stress in ALS may also derive from a defective oxidative phosphorylation (Bacman et al.,  2006 ), as reported from studies of CSF in transgenic mice and in patients, in which ROS produced from defective oxidative phosphorylation, such as 3-nitrotyrosine, were found in high concentration (Tohgi et al.,  1999 ). Moreover, this study combined the increase of ROS with mitochondrial dysfunction and provided an example of how different pathogenetic mechanisms of ALS may be inter-related. 
       
       
         Protein Aggregates 
         Protein aggregates are a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s diseases and ALS. These aggregates derive from the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which oligomerize and aggregate, gaining toxic properties (Julien,  2001 ). Inclusions rich in mutated SOD1 proteins have been found in tissues from both sALS and fALS cases, as well in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice (Boillée et al.,  2006a ). 
         The structure of SOD1 in the aggregates is not clear, but it seems that the protein is disulfide-reduced and lacks both copper and zinc atoms. The aberrant accumulation of mutated proteins is also related to a lack of their degradation, resulting in aggregates consisting of mutated SOD1 and other mutated proteins related to ALS, such as TDP43 or FUS. 
         TDP43, an RNA-binding protein, is normally located in the nucleus, where it regulates transcription, splicing and mRNA transport. This protein is necessary for the prevention of DNA damage (Hill et al.,  2016 ). TDP43 aberrant protein inclusions have been reported in 80% of ALS cases and it seems that the cytoplasmic accumulation is due to mutations in the 3′ UTR region of the genes, which lead to overexpression and altered location of the protein (Neumann et al.,  2006 ; Coan and Mitchell,  2015 ). As TDP43, FUS is a nuclear protein. The accumulation of TDP43 and FUS in the cytoplasm is probably due to mutations which prevent their shuttles to the nucleus (Dormann and Haass,  2011 ). 
         Protein inclusions in ALS contain also other components, such as chaperones, mitochondrial proteins, ubiquitin and neurofilaments (NFs). Moreover, the aberrant accumulation of ubiquitin and of ubiquinated and misfolded proteins could affect the normal function of the proteasome machinery, impairing normal protein degradation and leading to further protein accumulation, degeneration and death of motoneurons. 
       
       
         Accumulation of Neurofilaments 
         Accumulation and/or aggregation of NFs in the cell bodies and axons, and abnormal location of phosphorylated NFs in the cell body are typical pathological hallmarks of ALS. NFs are the major intermediate filaments in neurons; they are the most abundant cytoskeletal components of large myelinated axons and control the axonal caliber. NFs are formed by the co-polymerization of light (NF-L, 65 kDa), medium (NF-M, 95 kDa) and heavy (NF-H, 115 kDa) subunits. NF-L is necessary for filament assembly, whereas NF-M and NF-H form links with other NFs in the axon (Julien,  1999 ). Also α-internexin is an integral component of NFs in the CNS, in particular during axon elongation (Yuan et al.,  2006 ). 
         The mechanisms leading to the formation of NF aggregates in ALS are still unclear. Mutations in NF genes occur in fALS and sALS and seem to be correlated with abnormal phosphorylation of NFs. Phosphorylation of NF-H and NF-M usually occurs only in the axon and the rate of NF transport is inversely correlated to their phosphorylation state. The abnormal phosphorylation could alter the axonal transport of NFs, determining their accumulation in the cell bodies and proximal axon. This accumulation could be at the basis of defects in axonal transport of other cellular components important for cell survival, such as mitochondria (Xiao et al.,  2006 ). 
         The aggregation of NFs could also be due to their altered stoichiometry: overexpression or downregulation of NF subunits in murine models of ALS provoke NF accumulation (Perrot and Eyer,  2009 ). Transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice which overexpress the NF-L subunit exhibit excessive accumulation of NFs in the perikarya and proximal axon of motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, accompanied by proximal axonal swelling and subsequent degeneration (Xu et al.,  1993 ).  In situ  hybridization revealed a consistent reduction in NF-L mRNA levels in degenerating spinal motoneurons of ALS patients (Tomkins et al.,  1998 ; Al-Chalabi et al.,  1999 ; Wong et al.,  2000 ), while NF-L deficiency accelerates motoneuron degeneration in transgenic mice (Xu et al.,  1993 ), indicating the importance of NF protein stoichiometry in the distribution and aggregation of NFs. 
         Surprisingly, overexpression of both NF-L and NF-H subunits significantly slowed down disease progression in mouse models of ALS. Double transgenic mice (SOD1(G93A) gene and NF-L or NF-H genes) showed a significant delay in disease progression and an extension of survival compared with SOD1(G93A) mice (Kong and Xu,  2000 ), suggesting a protective effect of NF accumulation. The mechanism of this protection is unclear, but perikaryal accumulation of NFs rather than their axonal deficiency could be responsible in slowing down the disease. 
         The abnormal organization of NF seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, although the relationship between their accumulation and motoneuron neurodegeneration remains unclear. Despite the correlation of some mutations of NF genes with ALS disease, specific mutations in NF genes have not been identified, indicating that probably NF gene mutations are not a common cause of ALS but could represent a risk factor for selective motoneuron vulnerability. 
       
       
         Neuroinflammation 
         A common characteristic of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases is the neuroinflammatory response, characterized by activated microglia, astrogliosis and infiltrating immune cells in the sites of neuronal injury. Although ALS involves the selective death of motoneurons, different lines of evidence have shown that neuronal injury is non-cell-autonomous but depends on a finely regulated dialog between motoneurons and glial cells. Deregulated communication between neurons and glial cells compromises neuronal homeostasis and survival, and the involvement of mutant glia in motoneuron degeneration is well documented. The expression of mutant SOD1 gene limited to motoneurons is not sufficient to cause disease in transgenic mouse model of ALS, leading to suppose that their degeneration requires the participation of non-neuronal cells (Clement et al.,  2003 ). Non-mutated motoneurons surrounded by glial cells carrying a SOD1 mutated gene develop the pathological phenotype, while mutated motoneurons surrounded by wild-type glia show a healthy phenotype (Clement et al.,  2003 ). Moreover, the replacement of mutant SOD1 in glial cells with wild-type glia delays the disease and prolongs the survival of ALS mice (Lee et al.,  2012 ). Thus, damaged glia and neurons act together contributing to the process of neurodegeneration and to disease progression. 
         In the CNS, microglial cells are the resident macrophages and represent the first line of defense against infection or injury, monitoring the extracellular environment and interacting with neurons and astrocytes. These cells have immunological properties, with both neuroprotective and neurotoxic potential. After CNS injury, microglial activation is a major component of neuroinflammation. In particular, in ALS the interaction between motoneurons and microglia initially protects neurons. When motoneuron damage worsens, motoneurons and astrocytes release misfolded proteins (such as mutated SOD1) and other toxic molecules that stimulate the activation of microglial cells, which switch from an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective to a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype (Appel et al.,  2011 ; Zhao et al.,  2013 ). Microglial activation includes activated microglia (M1) and alternatively activated microglia (M2). M1 microglia are cytotoxic and secrete ROS, proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic molecules, mediating motoneuron death (Almer et al.,  1999 ; Elliott,  2001 ). Studies in SOD1 transgenic mice have shown that the replacement of mutant SOD1 microglia with wild-type microglia, as well as the specific reduction of the expression of mutant SOD1 gene in these cells, significantly reduce motoneuron degeneration and extend the lifespan of the animals (Beers et al.,  2006 ; Boillée et al.,  2006b ). This points to an involvement of microglial cells in neurodegeneration, underlining that mutant SOD1 microglia acquire a M1 toxic phenotype promoting disease progression. 
         Unlike the M1 phenotype, M2 microglia produce high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors that enhance the protection and survival of motoneurons. The upregulation of M2 markers in the spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) mice demonstrated that in the early stage of the disease microglia display an M2 phenotype which promotes repair and regeneration. During disease progression, damaged motoneurons induce microglial cells to release ROS and proinflammatory cytokines and to acquire an M1 phenotype leading to further neurotoxicity (Zhao et al.,  2013 ). Activated microglia increase during disease progression due to their interaction with the cell microenvironment at different stages of the disease, which plays a key role in determining a neuroprotective or neurotoxic function of microglia. 
         Astrocytes are the largest glial cell components of the CNS and play many important functions in maintaining and supporting neurons. Reactive astrogliosis has been implicated in neurodegeneration and in the progression of ALS. One of the most important functions of astrocytes in supporting neurons is to maintain low concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft through EAAT2 glutamate receptors. In patients with sALS and fALS, as well as in SOD1 mice, astrocytes downregulate the EAAT2 transporter, determining a less efficient uptake of glutamate and contributing to excitotoxicity (Howland et al.,  2002 ). Other studies have shown that, upon activation, an insufficient release of neurotrophic factors and the release of neurotoxic factors from astrocytes are involved in neurodegeneration (Komine and Yamanaka,  2015 ). This was also indicated by analyses of astrocytes in post-mortem tissue of ALS patients, which revealed an upregulation of 22 genes encoding chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines and components of the complement cascade, which could exacerbate neural damage and loss of already compromised neurons (Zhao et al.,  2013 ). Moreover, the selective removal of the mutant SOD1 gene from astrocytes, or the transplantation of healthy astroglial cells, slowed down the disease progression, attenuated motoneuron loss and increased the lifespan in SOD1 transgenic mice (Lepore et al.,  2008 ; Yamanaka et al.,  2008 ), indicating the involvement of astroglial cells in the neurodegeneration process. 
       
     
     
       Therapeutic Approaches in ALS 
       Given the complexity of ALS pathogenesis, to date there is no effective treatment to cure or significantly ameliorate the quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, several therapeutic strategies have been proposed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life of ALS patients. 
       
         Pharmacological Therapy 
         The only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is riluzole (2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxy benzothiazole, also known as rilutek), that acts as an inhibitor of glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, thus limiting glutamate excitotoxicity. Moreover, riluzole has other neuroprotective pharmacological actions, including the modulation of the NMDA ionotropic receptors, inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels and inhibition of the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ–aminobutyric acid (Gurney et al.,  1998 ).  In vitro  studies have demonstrated that riluzole protects motoneuron cell lines from glutamate stress, blocking excitotoxic damage (Doble,  1997 ). Neuroprotection has also been observed  in vivo  in models of ALS, in which treatment with the drug before the onset prolongs survival and slows neurodegeneration, improving motor performance of the treated animals (Gurney et al.,  1998 ). However, the clinical use of riluzole (100 mg daily) prolongs the life of patients by 3 months, although the results obtained in clinical trials are often controversial (Miller et al.,  2012 ). The beneficial effect is very modest: only a small beneficial effect in both bulbar and limb functions but no effect on muscle strength were found (Musarò,  2013 ). In some studies, the neuroprotective effect of riluzole was examined in combination with other drugs. Rasagiline is an antiapoptotic drug which reduces oxidative stress (by inhibition of monoamine oxidase B) and preserves mitochondrial membrane potential. The combined treatment of rasagiline with riluzole determined a dose-dependent improvement in motor performance and extended survival in SOD1(G93A) mice more than treatments in which rasaligine was administered alone (Waibel et al.,  2004 ). Given the modest efficacy and the high cost, doubts persist about the clinical administration of these drugs and additional studies are needed to improve their clinical effect. 
         Since loss of neurotrophic support to motoneurons has been proposed as mechanism contributing to ALS, several studies have reported that increased levels of growth factors (such as insulin-like growth factor 1, glial cell line derived growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic factors) have a positive effect in experimental models of the disease (Gould and Oppenheim,  2011 ), promoting neuron hypertrophy and survival. In particular, in animal models, the efficacy of growth factors delivered by viral-mediated gene (to stimulate the secretion of specific trophic factors to target cells) or by directed infusion of the trophic factors in the spinal cord or in the brain provided a modest benefit slowing down disease progression and increasing survival of the animals (Boillée et al.,  2006a ). However, human trials based on the use of neurotrophic factors showed modest or no effects (Beghi et al.,  2011 ). 
         These pharmacological strategies are directed against one or a few altered mechanisms involved in ALS and their use has only a minimal impact on the disease course. Probably, for an efficient therapeutic approach it could be helpful to counteract different pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the disease. For this reason, since the transplantation of stem cells and gene therapy can act via multiple mechanisms, in the last years an increasing interest has been addressed to these therapeutic approaches. 
       
       
         Gene Therapy 
         ALS can be caused by dominant mutations in SOD1 that give toxic property to the mutant protein. Since the complete absence of the SOD1 gene does not cause the disease in mice (Reaume et al.,  1996 ), the SOD1 gene silencing has been regarded as an interesting possibility to limit the course of the pathology. In particular, a lentivirus encoding for a RNA silencing (siRNA) that catalyzes the selective degradation of SOD1-mRNA was used in this approach. The injection of this virus in the muscle or directly in the spinal cord of transgenic mouse models of ALS reduced SOD1 expression delaying the neurodegeneration, but data about the slowing down of the disease progression and survival are controversial (Ralph et al.,  2005 ; Raoul et al.,  2005 ). Moreover, this approach could be used only for a familial form of ALS and not for sALS which represents the majority of cases. 
         An antisense oligonucleotide directed to SOD1-mRNA was found to decrease the concentration of SOD1 mRNA and related protein in the spinal cord, prolonging survival in the SOD1(G93A) rat model of the disease (Smith et al.,  2006 ). After this encouraging result, to date the only clinical trial performed in phase I has shown the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of this antisense oligonucleotide (Miller et al.,  2013 ). Despite the small number of patients, the study showed that the intrathecal administration of antisense oligonucleotide is safe and well-tolerated. However, antisense oligonucleotides do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and, to cure ALS patients, they should be delivered directly to the CNS (O’Connor and Boulis,  2015 ), which is difficult to achieve. Moreover, this type of treatment requires a constant infusion of repeated doses of the antisense nucleotide. Gene therapy requires to be optimized for a successful approach to neurodegenerative diseases. 
       
       
         Stem Cell Therapy 
         Stem cells are becoming a promising therapeutic approach to neuronal replacement and regeneration, becoming a source of great hope and expectation for patients affected by different neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. The use of stem cells as therapeutic approach is of great interest given their ability to home to damaged sites, stimulate tissue repair and regeneration, and direct their differentiation in response to extracellular signals (Faravelli et al.,  2014 ). 
         Stem cells are a group of cells with the ability of self-renewal and to differentiate in many cell types. They are usually divided in two major subtypes: embryonic stem cells (ESC), originated from the inner cell mass of blastocyst and that possess the ability to produce all the three germ layers; adult stem cells, specialized cells that can differentiate into many cell types of different organs, usually determined by the germ layer of origin (Meamar et al.,  2013 ). Among the different stem cell types, the most common used for neurological diseases are: ESC, neural stem cells (NSC), MSC and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). The best source of stem cells should be chosen on the basis of their biological features to survive, migrate to the damaged tissues, engraft and differentiate (Faravelli et al.,  2014 ). 
         The main objectives of the treatment with stem cells are cellular replacement and neural protection. The first objective would be achieved by the stem cell differentiation into specific cell subtypes involved in the disease, with the purpose to replace dead cells. The second objective involves the use of stem cells based on their ability to release trophic factors and to remove neurotoxic molecules, providing a local support in the microenvironment of the damaged area, acting as neural protectors. 
         Among the different types of stem cells used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, MSC seem to have aroused the highest interest as promising candidates (Baglio et al.,  2012 ). MSC can be isolated from a variety of fetal and adult tissues, such as skeletal muscle, placenta, umbilical cord, blood and adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is gaining increasing interest because it is available in large amount from liposuction, allowing autologous transplantation of adipose-derived MSC (ASC). 
         There are several technical advantages in the application of MSC. First of all, their isolation is safe and easy, their expansion  in vitro  is simple and it was demonstrated, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , that they can differentiate in neural-like, glial-like and astrocytic-like cells (Marconi et al.,  2013 ; Haidet-Phillips and Maragakis,  2015 ). MSC are less susceptible to tumoral changes and do not require immunosuppressive treatment to prevent rejection given the possibility of autologous transplantation. Moreover, as the other stem cells, after transplantation and migration, MSC are attracted to the damaged area, where they increase the release of neurotrophic factors (Meamar et al.,  2013 ). 
         Several studies have provided evidence for the efficacy of MSC in  in vivo  models of ALS, demonstrating that their injections can delay the death of motoneurons, decrease the inflammatory response and may prolong survival of the animals. Results of some preclinical studies in  in vivo  models of ALS with MSC are reported in Table  1 .

         Due to the positive results obtained in  in vivo  models of the disease, in the last years numerous cell-based clinical trials for ALS have used MSC, and have reported the feasibility, safety and immunological effects of administration of MSC to ALS patients (Table  2 ).

         However, despite stem cell-mediated therapy represents a new promising approach to cure ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders, to date no significant effects on the disease progression have been obtained compared to placebo-treated controls and key issues need to be solved before extensive clinical translation. First, it is necessary to identify the delivery of the cells to the CNS using standardized protocols and considering the route of administration, the dose of cells, the timing and the number of cell-injections. Moreover, given the high proliferative capacity of stem cells, the oncogenic transformation of transplanted cells should be prevented and their immunorejection avoided. 
         After the demonstration that only a small proportion of injected stem cells can reach, engraft and differentiate in the site of injury, the idea that the beneficial effect of stem cells is indirect and most probably depends on their paracrine activity is becoming more pervasive (Baglio et al.,  2012 ; Maumus et al.,  2013 ; Lai et al.,  2015 ). Stem cells produce a large spectrum of EVs which contain cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteins and nucleic acids, and can exert significant effects on cells, mediating cell-cell communication. These observations led to the hypothesis that stem cells exert their beneficial effect through the secretion of EVs which enhance the repair of the damaged area releasing their content. Thus, EVs could be used as a novel cell-free therapeutic approach, avoiding all the risks associated with the use of cells. 
       
     
     
       Extracellular Vesicles 
       Intercellular communication plays a fundamental role in multicellular organisms. It can be mediated through a direct contact between cells or by the secretion of molecules, such as growth factors, chemokines and cytokines, exerting their effect on cells in their proximity. In the last decades, a novel mechanism of cell communication has been proposed and involves intercellular transfer of EVs. These vesicles represent a vehicle to transfer membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, lipids and nucleic acids between cells, becoming an integral part of the intercellular microenvironment and playing a role in many physiological and pathological processes. 
       EVs are spherical particles enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer. They can be distinguished on the basis of their size (ranging from 30 nm to 1000 nm in diameter), lipid and protein composition, sedimentation rate, flotation density on a sucrose cargo and biogenesis pathway (Maumus et al.,  2013 ; Lai et al.,  2015 ). According to the biogenesis, morphology, protein compositions and size, EVs are classified as microvesicles and exosomes. 
       
         Microvesicles 
         Microvesicles (also known as shedding vesicles) range from 150 nm to 1000 nm in diameter, although the size ranges of microvesicles and exosomes may overlap, especially when vesicles are isolated from biological fluids (György et al.,  2011 ). Microvesicles are released by budding from the plasma membrane through a process dependent on intracellular calcium concentration, calpain and cytoskeleton reorganization, unlike exosomes, whose release is independent of cell calcium influx (Maumus et al.,  2013 ). Calcium ions are responsible for the changes in phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane, which is of primary importance for the formation of cytoplasmic protrusions (Biancone et al.,  2012 ). Microvesicles are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer and contain proteins, lipids and nucleic acids depending on the cell of origin. A typical characteristic of these vesicles is that they usually contain proteins associated with lipid rafts and cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ceramide and phosphatidylserine (Biancone et al.,  2012 ). 
       
       
         Exosomes 
         Exosomes are EVs produced by almost all cell types, with a diameter ranging from 30 nm to 100 nm and a flotation density of 1.10–1.18 g/ml (Lai et al.,  2015 ). They are present in many biological fluids, including urine, saliva, blood, amniotic fluid and CSF, as well as in a conditioned medium of cell culture (Kourembanas,  2015 ). The most commonly used techniques for their isolation are represented by ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration and immunoprecipitation, although many isolation kits are currently available (Maumus et al.,  2013 ; Raposo and Stoorvogel,  2013 ). 
         The morphology of exosomes is described as “cup shaped” after visualization by transmission electron microscopy. They are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer and contain many characteristic proteins, lipids and functional RNAs, in particular mRNAs and microRNA (miRNAs) that can be transferred between cells. Concerning protein composition, exosomes from different cell types present typical endosome-associated proteins (as GTPase and Alix) or membrane proteins (as tetraspanin CD63, CD9, CD81 and heat-shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90) involved in their biogenesis, transport and fusion (Raposo and Stoorvogel,  2013 ). 
         The cargo and composition of exosomes are unique and depend in part from the cell of origin and its physiological state (Jarmalavičiūtė and Pivoriūnas,  2016 ). Exosomes derived from diseased cells are usually implicated in the spread of pathological processes or in the propagation of diseases, while exosomes derived from stem cells can be used as therapeutic tools (Jarmalavičiūtė and Pivoriūnas,  2016 ). Many studies on the biochemical composition of exosomes have been performed. The results on the composition of exosomes in terms of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids are reported in the database ExoCarta  1  , recently incorporated in another database, Vesiclepedia, which includes data from all types of EVs (Mathivanan et al.,  2012 ; Raposo and Stoorvogel,  2013 ). 
         Some of the properties (such as size and morphology) of exosomes overlap with those of microvesicles, but exosomes are the only class known to have an endosomal origin, distinguishing them from other vesicles. Exosomes originate from invagination and endocytosis of the plasma membrane. These early endosomes mature through a series of transformation and changes in protein content to become late endosomes. The membranes of late endosomes give rise to vesicles ranging from 30 to100 nm in size (exosomes), contained in multivesicular bodies which during this phase have incorporated proteins (from plasma membrane and Golgi complex), lipids and nucleic acids (Zhang et al.,  2016 ). The multivesicular bodies can be degraded in lysosomes or can be fused with the plasma membrane, releasing exosomes in the extracellular environment. 
         Released exosomes can act in a paracrine or endocrine manner, modifying the behavior of adjacent or distant cells. The role of exosomes in physiological and pathological processes depends on their ability to interact with recipient cells to deliver their content. In particular, the vesicles can be internalized by recipient cells by endocytosis, by fusion or after contact with surface receptors (Raposo and Stoorvogel,  2013 ; Kourembanas,  2015 ). 
       
       
         Functions of Extracellular Vesicles in Intercellular Communication 
         Once secreted from the cells, exosomes and microvesicles can interact with adjacent or distant recipient cells and deliver their cargo, modulating their activities. In addition to providing biologically active molecules, EVs protect these molecules against degradation until they reach the target site, and facilitate their uptake from the recipient cells. The uptake can be direct, by fusion with the target cell or by endocytosis, or indirect, mediated by receptor binding. The fusion of EVs with the plasma membrane determines the direct release of the content of EVs inside the cells, while, with the other mechanisms, EVs remain within the endosome until they fuse with the endosome membrane, releasing their content into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, endosomes can fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of the vesicles and their content (Turturici et al.,  2014 ). 
         The proteins and functional RNAs contained in the EVs are implicated in many biochemical and cellular processes, such as communication, inflammation, tissue repair and regeneration, cell differentiation, as well as metabolism (Lai et al.,  2015 ). 
         The cargo, and therefore the functions, of EVs depend on the phenotype of the cell of origin. Nevertheless, it has been shown that a selective enrichment of specific molecules occurs: some proteins and, above all, functional RNAs are preferentially sorted to EVs and released through them (Li et al.,  2013 ) and the selective fate of molecules into the EVs is finely regulated in both physiological and pathological conditions. During development, secreted EVs contain morphogens (such as sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid), playing an important role in developmental signaling and morphogenesis (Greco et al.,  2001 ). EVs also contain bioactive lipids that can stimulate cytokine secretion, induce chemotaxis or inhibit apoptosis (Turturici et al.,  2014 ). EVs released from tumor cells contain molecules which stimulate proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis (Turturici et al.,  2014 ). Moreover, in this case, cells release EVs containing caspase-3 and Fas ligand, allowing tumor cells to escape from apoptosis and immunosurveillance. 
         Concerning EVs secreted from stem cells, it was hypothesized that they can be involved in self-renewal and the pluripotency typical of these cells, and that they can play key roles in signaling within the stem cell niche. 
         Recently, more attention has been given to the ability of EVs to transfer genetic information between cells, in particular mRNAs and miRNAs. Intercellular communication based on these functional RNAs require the selectively compartmentation of RNAs in an appropriate vehicle, the protection from circulating RNAses, and the ability of RNA to retain the capability to control gene expression. For these reasons, EVs represent an optimal candidate for genetic exchange between cells, modulating the behavior of recipient cells. Exosomes released from MSC may regulate neurite outgrowth and neural plasticity by the transfer of miRNA-133b (Xin et al.,  2012 ). Exosomes obtained from bone marrow-MSC (BM-MSC) contain miRNA-21 and miRNA-222 which are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Collino et al.,  2010 ). This indicates that the biological effects on the neighboring cells can be, in part, regulated by shuttled-RNA of EVs. 
       
       
         Therapeutic Applications of Exosomes 
         Since exosomes and microvesicles can transfer biological information over long distance, increasing attention has been paid to these vesicles as promoters of suppressors of pathological processes. As exosomes are smaller than microvesicles and capable to cross the BBB, here we will focus on the use of exosomes as a potential therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. 
         There is evidence that infusion of exosomes isolated from neuroblastoma or primary neurons into the brain ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease course in a mouse model, sequestering intracerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide (Yuyama et al.,  2015 ). 
         Another cellular source to obtain exosomes is represented by MSC and several studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of these exosomes. In particular, exosomes derived from MSC isolated from dental pulp protected dopaminergic neurons against neurodegeneration induced by 6-hydroxy-dopamine oxidative stress, reducing the production of ROS and consequently apoptosis, indicating a potential therapeutic use of exosomes in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (Jarmalavičiūtė et al.,  2015 ). Another study reported that exosomes isolated from adipose tissue-MSC decrease the levels of Aβ in an  in vitro  model of Alzheimer’s disease, thanks to the high level of neprilysin (an important protein for the proteolysis of Aβ, whose activity and expression decrease during the disease) contained in the exosomes (Katsuda et al.,  2013 ). The neuroprotective effect of exosomes obtained from ASC was also demonstrated in human neuroblastoma cell line and primary murine hippocampal neurons after an oxidative insult (Farinazzo et al.,  2015 ). Moreover, exosomes derived from BM-MSC have been used to improve recovery and neuroregeneration after stroke and traumatic brain injury (Xin et al.,  2013 ; Zhang et al.,  2015 ). 
         We recently demonstrated that exosomes isolated from ASC exert a neuroprotective effect in an  in vitro  model of ALS (Bonafede et al.,  2016 ). In this study, we used the motoneuron-like cell line NSC-34 transiently and stable transfected with different SOD1 point mutations to mimic the behavior of ALS motoneurons, and H 2 O 2  as pathological insult. The presence of exosomes increased ALS motoneuron survival, probably counteracting the apoptosis pathway, underlining their possible therapeutic application to ALS. Another study demonstrated the possible application of ASC derived exosomes in ALS, reducing mutant SOD1 aggregation and restoring mitochondrial protein function (Lee et al.,  2016a ). Moreover, exosomes derived from ASC ameliorated the disease progression in an  in vitro  model of Huntington’s disease, reducing huntingtin protein aggregates and the level of apoptotic proteins (Lee et al.,  2016b ). Altogether, these studies indicate a protective beneficial role of exosomes in different neurodegenerative diseases. 
         Increasing evidence suggests that exosomes display anti-inflammatory properties, reducing the number of activated inflammatory microglial cells, supporting oligodendrocytes and protecting neurons (Zhuang et al.,  2011 ; Pusic et al.,  2014 ). Moreover, exosomes injected intranasally are transported rapidly to the brain, where they can be taken up by microglial cells (Zhuang et al.,  2011 ). Since, as stated above, neuroinflammation is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases, the suppression of the neuroinflammatory response and the possibility to reach easily the CNS are of great importance for the treatment of these pathologies. 
         The increasing attention to the use of exosomes for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases derives from the capability of exosomes to cross the BBB, the physiological barrier that separates the brain parenchyma from circulating blood in the CNS. As mentioned before, current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are often symptomatic and do not halt the degenerative processes; the main problem for the cure of these pathologies is the inability of cells and drugs to cross the BBB. Recent studies have reported that exosomes, unlike microvesicles, can cross the BBB: the hypothesis is that exosomes are internalized by endothelial cells and, through the release of specific cargo, they affect the integrity of cell junctions increasing permeability between cells and allowing a massive entry of vesicles in the CNS (Zhou et al.,  2014 ; Tominaga et al.,  2015 ; Jarmalavičiūtė and Pivoriūnas,  2016 ), where they could exert neuroprotective actions (Figure  2 ). 
         
           Figure 2 
           
              Hypothetical mechanisms of action of exosomes.  Exosomes interact with the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) modifying the integrity of cell junctions and increasing the permeability between cells. This mechanism allows a massive entry of vesicles in the central nervous system (CNS). Once in the CNS, exosomes could interact directly on motoneurons (arrows) modulating different biological processes (such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, gene expression and oxidative stress) or indirectly modifying the local motoneuron environment, acting on glial cells that decrease the release of toxic factor and inflammatory mediators (dotted arrows). These direct and indirect mechanisms of action of exosomes could counteract the pathological mechanisms involved in the disease. 
           
           
         
         In this regards, we recently set up a protocol to label exosomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and the use of labeled exosomes, which allows their detection by magnetic resonance imaging, could be useful to verify this hypothesis (Busato et al.,  2016 ). 
       
     
     
       Conclusions and Future Perspectives 
       The scientific interest on MSC as potential therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases is due to their ability to migrate to damaged tissues, differentiate and contribute to reparative processes (Faravelli et al.,  2014 ). Besides these characteristics, ASC are also easily available and can be used for autologous transplantation, avoiding possible cell rejection (Marconi et al.,  2013 ). These properties make ASC a candidate for cell therapy based on cell replacement and cell differentiation. These features have led different research groups to use ASC as possible therapy for ALS. In a study on the effects of ASC systemic administration in a murine model of ALS we have demonstrated that the treatment delayed signs of motor deterioration although a limited amount of ASC in the site of injury was detected (Marconi et al.,  2013 ). Since the beneficial effects of ASC could be due to paracrine activity rather than to their engraftment, the scientific community has shifted the focus from cells to EVs, which, thanks to their content, can recapitulate the ASC effects and could potentially provide the basis for a non-cell-based therapy for the treatment of ALS. This innovative therapy would be easy to transfer to ALS patients since the EVs would be obtained from autologous ASC and would preserve the immune properties of their origins, avoiding immunogenic reaction. 
       In view of a possible application of EVs to ALS, a disease in which the BBB is not disrupted, the vesicles need to cross the BBB to reach the site of injury and, among EVs, exosomes have the required characteristics. To test the effects of exosomes in ALS, we have recently demonstrated that the administration of exosomes in an  in vitro  model of ALS exerts a neuroprotective effect following an oxidative insult, supporting the idea that exosomes can recapitulate and ameliorate the neuroprotective effect of stem cell therapy (Bonafede et al.,  2016 ). 
       The evaluation of the exosomes content, in terms of proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs, and their correlation with a specific cellular pathway involved in ALS, could pave the way to explain their mechanism of action. Moreover, the understanding of the involved pathways could lead to the generation of engineered cells which release exosomes enriched with specific molecules. This could lead to a targeted exosome therapy in ALS.

         Photoferrotrophy, the process by which inorganic carbon is fixed into organic matter using light as an energy source and reduced iron [Fe(II)] as an electron donor, has been proposed as one of the oldest photoautotrophic metabolisms on Earth. Under the iron-rich (ferruginous) but sulfide poor conditions dominating the Archean ocean, this type of metabolism could have accounted for most of the primary production in the photic zone. Here we review the current knowledge of biogeochemical, microbial and phylogenetic aspects of photoferrotrophy, and evaluate the ecological significance of this process in ancient and modern environments. From the ferruginous conditions that prevailed during most of the Archean, the ancient ocean evolved toward euxinic (anoxic and sulfide rich) conditions and, finally, much after the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, to a predominantly oxic environment. Under these new conditions photoferrotrophs lost importance as primary producers, and now photoferrotrophy remains as a vestige of a formerly relevant photosynthetic process. Apart from the geological record and other biogeochemical markers, modern environments resembling the redox conditions of these ancient oceans can offer insights into the past significance of photoferrotrophy and help to explain how this metabolism operated as an important source of organic carbon for the early biosphere. Iron-rich meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes can be considered as modern analogs of the ancient Archean ocean, as they present anoxic ferruginous water columns where light can still be available at the chemocline, thus offering suitable niches for photoferrotrophs. A few bacterial strains of purple bacteria as well as of green sulfur bacteria have been shown to possess photoferrotrophic capacities, and hence, could thrive in these modern Archean ocean analogs. Studies addressing the occurrence and the biogeochemical significance of photoferrotrophy in ferruginous environments have been conducted so far in lakes Matano, Pavin, La Cruz, and the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu. To date, only in the latter two lakes a biogeochemical role of photoferrotrophs has been confirmed. In this review we critically summarize the current knowledge on iron-driven photosynthesis, as a remains of ancient Earth biogeochemistry.

       Introduction 
       Photosynthesis is the main primary production process fueling life on Earth. It requires light as energy source, inorganic carbon to be fixed, and a source of electrons ( Hamilton et al., 2016 ). While oxygenic photosynthesis is currently the dominant process for fixing inorganic carbon into organic matter, this has changed during the history of life ( Olson and Blankenship, 2004 ). Very different conditions existed on early Earth ( Canfield et al., 2006 ), as the chemical environment (e.g., the availability of electron acceptors and donors for biogeochemical processes) and, consequently, the favored biogeochemical processes, differed in the ancient biosphere from those currently prevailing. Even though rates of marine primary production were much lower in these primitive seas than in modern oceans, the most active ecosystems were probably driven by cycling of H 2  and Fe(II) ( Canfield et al., 2006 ), though other photo- and chemolithoautotrophic processes could also have contributed [e.g., non-photosynthetic Fe(II) and sulfide oxidation]. Still, the early appearance of photosynthesis enhanced biological productivity by orders of magnitude compared to metabolisms based on acetogenesis and methanogenesis as the ancestral forms of carbon and energy metabolisms ( Sleep and Bird, 2008 ;  Sousa et al., 2013 ). Some modern ecosystems (the so-called “analogs,”  Burns et al., 2009 ) still show determinant similar features (i.e., redox conditions, iron and sulfur chemistry) to those predominating on ancient Earth, and offer opportunities to study the processes that sustained microbial life in the primitive biosphere. Photoferrotrophs, which use Fe(II) as an electron donor and light as an energy source for inorganic carbon fixation ( Widdel et al., 1993 ), as well as their biogeochemical role in modern and ancient ferruginous systems, are particularly addressed in this review. 
     
     
       Evolution of the Biogeochemical Conditions in Ancient Oceans 
       Once liquid water appeared on Earth around 4.3 Ga ago ( Mojzsis et al., 2001 ), life could emerge and develop in the oceans of the Archean (4 to 2.5 Ga ago) not later than around 3.8 Ga ago ( Mojzsis et al., 1996 ) as evidenced from biologically fractionated organic carbon ( Nutman et al., 2016 ), or even earlier ( Abramov and Mojzsis, 2009 ). The energy required for inorganic carbon fixation was available from sunlight, and from the oxidation of inorganic chemical substrates by chemolithoautotrophs using inorganic electron acceptors. Both photo- and chemolithoautotrophy were, consequently, an option for primary production on the primitive Earth ( Canfield et al., 2006 ). The advent of photosynthesis, however, relieved life from its dependence on the co-occurrence of reduced and oxidized inorganic compounds, as required for chemolithoautotrophy. Indeed, their co-availability is often limited by a high chemical reactivity; i.e., if oxidized and reduced substances readily react chemically, their availability for microbially mediated energy-gaining redox processes diminishes. In this context, light offers the advantage of being an energy source that is not dependent on such co-availability, therefore extending the potential niches for life colonization, although in water columns its availability is also limited to the surface photic layers. 
       Photosynthesis appeared in the early Archean ( Olson, 2006 ;  Fischer et al., 2016 ), and photosynthetic microbial mats populated benthic environments of oceans shores by around 3.4 Ga ago ( Tice and Lowe, 2004 ), though stromatolites formed around 3.7 Ga ago have also been recently reported ( Nutman et al., 2016 ). It is generally recognized that anoxygenic photosynthesis evolved before the more complex cyanobacterial-type oxygenic photosynthesis ( Xiong et al., 2000 ;  Xiong, 2006 ;  Schopf, 2011 ;  Gupta, 2013 ). The latter is thought to have appeared around 2.75 Ga ago ( Buick, 2008 ), but isotope-based and other data suggest that it may have been present even much earlier ( Rosing and Frei, 2004 ;  Planavsky et al., 2014 ). Some studies, for instance, provide evidence that oxygen was already present in the late Archean (ca. 2.7 Ga) surface environment, supporting oxidative elemental cycling ( Anbar et al., 2007 ;  Kendall et al., 2010 ;  Stolper et al., 2010 ;  Crowe et al., 2013 ;  Lalonde and Konhauser, 2015 ;  Frei et al., 2016 ). These oxygen traces or the consequences of these oxidative processes could have resulted from abiotic reactions such as CO 2  photodissociation ( Lu et al., 2014 ) and H 2 O 2  disproportionation ( Haqq-Misra et al., 2011 ), but also from biological processes like benthic oxygenic photosynthesis ( Lalonde and Konhauser, 2015 ). Atmospheric oxygen accumulation, however, did not occur at a global scale before the Great Oxidation Event around 2.33 Ga ago ( Bekker et al., 2004 ;  Kaufman et al., 2008 ;  Konhauser et al., 2009 ;  Lyons et al., 2014 ;  Luo et al., 2016 ). Instead multiple evidences suggest that photoferrotrophy could have been a relevant photoautotrophic process in the ancient biosphere. 
       During most of Earth history the ocean was anoxic, and its chemistry was influenced ( Figure  1  ) by the activity of microbial life ( Blake et al., 2010 ). Reduced iron [Fe(II)], of hydrothermal origin ( Klein, 2005 ), from biologically processed continental sources ( Li et al., 2015 ), and/or released by tectono-magmatic events ( Konhauser et al., 2007a ), dominated the mesophilic ( Hren et al., 2009 ;  Blake et al., 2010 ;  Poulton and Canfield, 2011 ), sulfur-poor ( Shen et al., 2003 ;  Crowe et al., 2014b ) Archean ocean chemistry ( Figures  1  ,   2  ). From these ferruginous conditions a transition toward a more sulfidic (euxinic) ocean occurred from the late Archean to the Mesoproterozoic ( Poulton et al., 2004 ;  Canfield et al., 2008 ;  Reinhard et al., 2009 ), though sulfide was likely spatially confined to parts of the ocean ( Reinhard et al., 2013 ). Modern analogs of these ancient euxinic environments still exist, such as the Black Sea (e.g.,  Overmann et al., 1992 ;  Meyer and Kump, 2008 ), or sulfide-rich meromictic ( Noguerola et al., 2016 ) and holomictic (e.g.,  Camacho and Vicente, 1998 ;  Camacho et al., 2000 ,  2001 ;  Camacho, 2006 ) lacustrine basins. In this sulfide-richer environment of the Proterozoic, sulfide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis acquired a more relevant role as a primary production process ( Kharecha et al., 2005 ;  Johnston et al., 2009 ). However, ferruginous conditions probably persisted in some zones of the oceans throughout the Proterozoic ( Poulton and Canfield, 2011 ) and even transiently dominated again deep-water chemistry in the Neoproterozoic ( Canfield et al., 2008 ;  Planavsky et al., 2009 ,  2011 ), though these deep layers were probably aphotic. Later on, during the Phanerozoic (0.54 Ga ago), the ocean became fully oxygenated ( Holland, 2006 ;  Hamilton et al., 2016 ;  Figure  1  ). In any case, during the first stages of life, reduced iron dominated ocean chemistry, and microorganisms with iron-based metabolisms were likely important biogeochemical actors on the primitive Earth ( Poulton and Canfield, 2011 ;  Kendall et al., 2012 ;  Llirós et al., 2015 ).

Deep anoxic water, rich in dissolved Fe(II) of hydrothermal origin, is transported onto the continental shelf, where Fe(II) gets oxidized. The produced oxides precipitate from solution toward the seafloor, in association with diverse components such as silica, carbonates or organic matter. The oxidation mechanisms are still unknown and could include a chemical reaction with dissolved O 2 , a UV-light mediated photo-oxidation (less probable), a biological iron-oxidation by anoxygenic photosynthesis using Fe(II) as electron donor, or a combination of the above mentioned processes. Illustration compiled from  Konhauser et al. (2002 ,  2007a ),  Kappler et al. (2005) ,  Canfield et al. (2006) ,  Severmann et al. (2008) ,  Blake et al. (2010) , and  Tangalos et al. (2010) . 
         
         
       
       In contrast to euxinic conditions, which can be identified in the geological record by a set of proxies (trace metals, isotopes, and lipid biomarkers), the identification and mineralogical characterization of sedimentary iron enrichments are used to reveal ferruginous deposition conditions ( Poulton and Canfield, 2011 ). Banded iron formations (BIF) are rocks of alternating layers rich  in silica  with layers rich in iron oxides ( Posth et al., 2008 ;  Walter, 2011 ;  Frei et al., 2016 ). BIF occur in geological records of several periods of the Archean (4 Ga to 2.5 Ga) and the Proterozoic (2.5 Ga – 0.54 Ga), especially between the Neoarchean (late Archean) and Early Paleoproterozoic – the Siderian – (2.7–2.4 Ga,  Pecoits et al., 2015 ). Both chemical and biological processes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for BIF genesis in the different time periods ( Figure  2  ). These include ( Cairns-Smith, 1978 ;  Johnson et al., 2008 ;  Posth et al., 2013 ): (i) Fe(II) photo-oxidation by UV light ( François, 1986 ;  Klein, 2005 ), or by photochemically produced H 2 O 2 , although the significance of these processes seems rather low ( Konhauser et al., 2007a ;  Pecoits et al., 2015 ); (ii) chemical oxidation by dissolved oxygen of photosynthetic origin ( Holland, 2006 ;  Kump, 2008 ), and, hypothetically, could even include; (iii) abiotic oxidation of Fe(II) by microbially produced oxidized compounds such as nitrogen oxides (e.g.,  Klueglein and Kappler, 2013 ), though the sufficient availability of these oxides to support a visible contribution of this mechanism is yet to be shown. However, (iv) direct oxidation by microbial processes ( Garrels et al., 1973 ;  Hartman, 1984 ;  Li et al., 2011 ;  Posth et al., 2013 ;  Czaja et al., 2013 ;  Chan et al., 2016 ), mainly iron-oxidation by anoxygenic phototrophs using Fe(II) as electron donor, seems an attractive mechanism for early BIF formation, particularly for the time before oxygenic photosynthesis appeared on Earth ( Ehrenreich and Widdel, 1994a ;  Konhauser et al., 2002 ,  2005 ,  2007a , b ,  2011 ;  Kappler and Newman, 2004 ;  Kappler et al., 2005 ;  Croal et al., 2009 ;  Fru et al., 2013 ;  Li et al., 2013 ;  Eickhoff et al., 2014 ;  Sun et al., 2015 ).

       Iron is the most abundant metal on Earth, and among the most abundant elements in the Earth’s crust ( Kendall et al., 2012 ). Under circumneutral pH conditions Fe(II), particularly in its ionic form (Fe 2+ ), it is rapidly oxidized by oxygen to highly insoluble Fe(III) oxides. As a consequence iron can become a limiting nutrient for primary producers in vast areas of the well-oxygenated modern ocean, where iron concentration is typically &lt;1 nM ( Martin and Fitzwater, 1988 ). Under anoxic reduced conditions Fe(II) is the dominant iron form. Ionic Fe 2+  is several orders of magnitude more soluble than Fe(III) ( Stumm and Morgan, 1995 ;  Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003 ) and can reach high concentrations in ferruginous water columns ( Table  1  ) and in the pore water of freshwater sediments (e.g.,  Bravo et al., 2015 ). In sulfur-rich environments iron reacts with dissolved sulfide forming highly insoluble iron-sulfide minerals (e.g.,  Zopfi et al., 2004 ).

       The biological significance of iron is based on its redox behavior, with Fe(III) and Fe(II) as main oxidation states, making it a suitable electron donor or acceptor, respectively, for different dissimilatory processes ( Ehrenreich and Widdel, 1994a ;  Straub et al., 2001 ,  2004 ;  Lovley et al., 2004 ;  Weber et al., 2006 ) that greatly influence the iron cycle on Earth. These microbial processes include: (i) anaerobic ferric iron reduction with organic matter and H 2 , perhaps the first respiratory process on Earth (e.g.,  Vargas et al., 1998 ;  Lovley et al., 2004 ); (ii) anaerobic nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidation (e.g.,  Straub et al., 2004 ;  Weber et al., 2006 ); (iii) aerobic chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms that oxidize Fe(II) with oxygen (e.g.,  Emerson and Weiss, 2004 ;  Chan et al., 2016 ) and; (iv) Fe(II) photosynthesis, where photoferroautotrophic microorganisms use light energy (photo-) and the reducing power of Fe(II) (-ferro-) to fix inorganic carbon (-autotrophic), according to  Widdel et al. (1993) :

       Anoxygenic photosynthesis with Fe(II) as electron donor using exclusively photosystem I has been proposed as being the earliest type of photosynthetic process ( Des Marais, 2000 ;  Xiong et al., 2000 ;  Raymond et al., 2003 ). While there is currently no supporting evidence from genomic studies ( Frigaard and Bryant, 2008 ;  Gupta, 2013 ) that photoferrotrophy evolved prior to anoxygenic photosynthesis with other electron donors, such as sulfide or hydrogen, the ancient environmental conditions suggest that Fe(II)-photosynthesis was an important metabolic process in the iron-rich Archean oceans, prior to the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of enzymes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis support the existence of anoxygenic phototrophs prior to oxygenic phototrophs ( Xiong et al., 2000 ;  Xiong, 2006 ;  Gupta, 2013 ), although horizontal gene transfer between photosynthetic organisms complicates the phylogeny ( Raymond et al., 2003 ). Before demonstrating its occurrence, photoferrotrophy was hypothesized as a possible autotrophic metabolism for different types of phototrophic prokaryotes ( Olson and Blankenship, 2004 ;  Olson, 2006 ). Some authors suggested the possibility that both cyanobacteria (e.g.,  Cohen, 1984 ,  1989 ;  Cohen et al., 1986 ;  Pierson and Olson, 1989 ;  Pierson et al., 1999 ) and green sulfur bacteria ( Garcia-Gil et al., 1990 ) could perform anoxygenic photosynthesis with Fe(II) as electron donor. In spite of their capacity for anoxygenic photosynthesis ( Cohen et al., 1975 ,  1986 ), and its crucial role on Earth biogeochemistry, no evidence for the occurrence of photoferrotrophy has been provided so far for modern cyanobacteria ( Trouwborst et al., 2007 ;  Swanner et al., 2015 ;  Hamilton et al., 2016 ). 
       Anoxygenic photosynthesis using Fe(II) as electron donor was unequivocally demonstrated, for the first time, in purple bacteria, some of which were able to grow either photoautotrophically and/or photoheterotrophically ( Widdel et al., 1993 ;  Ehrenreich and Widdel, 1994b ). In the meantime, photoferrotrophy has been detected in bacteria of different phylogenetic groups and either from freshwater or marine origin, including representatives of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB, Gammaproteobacteria), purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB, Alphaproteobacteria), and green sulfur bacteria (GSB, Chlorobi). Even though most of these anoxygenic phototrophs are able to use several types of electron donors commonly found in anaerobic environments (e.g., H 2 S and H 2 ;  Bryant and Frigaard, 2006 ;  Camacho, 2009 ), there are some specific strains that have been demonstrated to perform Fe(II)-dependent anoxygenic photosynthesis ( Croal et al., 2009 ). These include strains phylogenetically related to PSB, such as the freshwater  Thiodictyon  sp. ( Croal et al., 2004 ;  Hegler et al., 2008 ), and the marine species  Rhodovulum iodosum  and  Rhodovulum robiginosum  ( Straub et al., 1999 ;  Wu et al., 2014 ); freshwater PNSB such as  Rhodobacter ferrooxidans  sp. strain SW2 ( Ehrenreich and Widdel, 1994b ;  Hegler et al., 2008 ),  Rhodomicrobium vannielii  ( Heising and Schink, 1998 ), and  Rhodopseudomonas palustris  ( Jiao et al., 2005 ;  Jiao and Newman, 2007 ); as well as a freshwater species of GSB,  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  ( Heising et al., 1999 ). Although the PNSB  Rhodobacter capsulatus  is also capable of oxidizing Fe(II) in presence of light, this is not a real photoautotrophic process ( Caiazza et al., 2007 ;  Kopf and Newman, 2012 ) and can be considered as a Fe(II) detoxification mechanism ( Poulain and Newman, 2009 ). 
       The best studied photoferrotrophs are purple non-sulfur bacteria (e.g.,  Widdel et al., 1993 ;  Eickhoff et al., 2013 ;  Wu et al., 2014 ). When comparing PSB with PNSB, rates of Fe(II) photooxidation are influenced by the response to light (e.g., light saturation) of each photoferrotrophic species. This was shown by  Kappler et al. (2005) , comparing the iron photoxidation of the purple sulfur bacteria  Thiodictyon  sp. and the purple non-sulfur bacteria  Rhodobacter ferrooxidans .  R .  ferrooxidans , with lower saturation intensity, is able to efficiently oxidize iron at rates of about 32 pmol Fe(II) h -1  cell -1  at 20°C, circumneutral pH and under light saturation conditions ( Hegler et al., 2008 ). Photoferrotrophs display mechanisms preventing cell encrustation with oxidized iron ( Miot et al., 2009 ;  Saraiva et al., 2012 ;  Wu et al., 2014 ). 
       Presumably, photoferrotrophs use a periplasmic c-type cytochrome for cyclic electron flow and other iron-oxidoreductases for linear electron transfer ( Bird et al., 2011 ). In  Rhodopseudomonas palustris , the  pio  (phototrophic iron oxidation) operon is essential for phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation, as it encodes, apart from a membrane transport protein, for small high-potential redox proteins such as  Pio C and cytochrome  c  2  ( Jiao and Newman, 2007 ). The latter is essential for cyclic electron flow, whereas  Pio C linearly transfers electrons from iron ( Bird et al., 2014 ). Operons related to phototrophic iron oxidation are also described for other purple non-sulfur bacteria, such as the  foxEYZ  operon from  R. ferrooxidans  SW2 and  R. capsulatus , also coding for proteins of similar functions as those encoded by the  pio  operon of  R. palustris  ( Croal et al., 2007 ;  Saraiva et al., 2012 ). 
       Green sulfur bacteria are among the most ancient photosynthetic organisms ( Gupta, 2013 ;  Gauger et al., 2016 ). Although it has been hypothesized that several  Chlorobium  species could perform Fe(II)-dependent anoxygenic photosynthesis in lakes (e.g.,  Garcia-Gil et al., 1990 ),  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  (both strains KoFox and KB) is so far the only GSB species whose photoferrotrophic ability has been demonstrated. While all other GSB species can use various sulfur compounds as electron donors, genomic analyses revealed that  C. ferrooxidans  has apparently lost most genes involved in oxidation of sulfur compounds ( Frigaard and Bryant, 2008 ).  Heising et al. (1999)  showed that strain KoFox was able to grow photoferroautotrophically in co-culture with  Geospirillum  sp. strain KoFum; whose fermentation of fumarate to organic acids enhanced Fe(II) oxidation by KoFox. Among other possible explanations, acidification of the medium by organic acids could be responsible for this enhancement as this could increase the solubility and hence the bioavailability of iron. Growth of photoferrotrophic KoFox is stimulated by the presence of silica, which is possibly due to its influence on iron chemistry, mediating encrustation patterns and cell–mineral interactions and reducing iron toxicity ( Posth et al., 2010 ;  Gauger et al., 2016 ). On the other hand,  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  strain KoFox is able to oxidize Fe(II) at very low light intensities, with saturation at &lt;50 lux compared to saturations of 400 lux for  R. ferrooxidans  and 800 lux for  Thiodictyon  ( Hegler et al., 2008 ). The capacity of GSB to present spectral modifications in their pigments ( Borrego et al., 1997 ;  Chew et al., 2007 ) and grow under a very dim light (e.g., &lt;0.0005% of surface irradiance,  Overmann et al., 1992 ;  Manske et al., 2005 ), enable GSB to thrive in deep zones of anoxic ferruginous basins where Fe(II) is available and light availability is still sufficient for a “frugal” photosynthesis ( Ormerod et al., 1993 ), making these organisms good candidates for performing photoferrotrophy in current Archean ocean analogs. 
       Although the possibility of manganese-oxidizing photo-synthesis has also been proposed ( Olson, 1970 ), even as a possible previous step to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis ( Johnson et al., 2013 ;  Fischer et al., 2016 ), so far no phototrophic Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium has been found and supporting evidences for manganese-oxidizing photosynthesis are “highly tenuous” ( Jones and Crowe, 2013 ). Even chlorinic photosynthesis –biologically mediated photolytic oxidation of aqueous chloride to form halocarbon or dihalogen products, coupled with CO 2  assimilation-, has been proposed as a potential metabolism on exoplanets under conditions that may approximate to the terrestrial Archean ( Haas, 2010 ). 
     
     
       Photoferrotrophy in Modern Water Columns: Occurrence and Significance 
       Apart from the information preserved in the geological record, knowledge about the metabolisms supporting life on ancient Earth, e.g., anoxygenic photosynthesis, can be gained by studying environments that are considered as “modern analogs” of different states of the ancient ocean ( Burns et al., 2009 ). Most meromictic lakes and other permanently stratified water bodies are euxinic, i.e., anoxic and sulfidic, below the chemocline ( Zadereev et al., 2017 ). Sulfidic basins of stratified lakes and closed seas might resemble the sulfidic ocean of the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic. Contrastingly, sulfide poor anoxic layers of iron-rich stratified (often meromictic) lakes are the most similar modern environments to the iron-rich Archean oceans, where photoferrotrophy could have played a crucial role in governing the biogeochemistry and providing energy to drive microbial growth and evolution ( Llirós et al., 2015 ). Ferruginous water columns are rare, largely unexplored ecosystems of which only freshwater representatives exist today because of the high sulfate concentrations in the modern ocean. In recent years, a few lakes have been described and studied as possible Archean ocean analogs providing insights on how ancient photoferrotrophs could flourish in the Archean ocean and on their possible role in its biogeochemistry.  Koeksoy et al. (2016)  reviewed the biogeochemical characteristics of some of these environments and paid special attention to iron chemistry and the usefulness of such systems to interpret Precambrian BIF deposition. 
       According to the current knowledge, the most appropriate Archean ocean analogs are natural iron-rich meromictic lakes. Meromictic lakes show a permanent stratification whose bottom water (monimolimnion), which has higher concentrations of dissolved salts ( Imboden and Wüest, 1995 ), does not mix with the overlaying waters due to the water density gradient and other factors linked to climate, lake morphometry and water flow ( Boehrer et al., 2009 ). In iron-rich meromictic lakes the high monimolimnetic iron concentrations contribute to the water column stability, which drove  Kjensmo (1967)  in his seminal manuscripts to use the term “iron-meromixis”. However, the strongest density gradient in these lakes is commonly owed to dissolved compounds other than iron (e.g., calcium bicarbonate,  Rodrigo et al., 2001 ). In stratified iron-rich lakes the interface between oxic and anoxic water bodies, the oxycline, is accompanied by a steep gradient of iron forms, the so-called “ferrocline” ( Bravidor et al., 2015 ). In addition to iron meromictic lakes, temporally stratified lakes have also been proposed as possible study sites as ancient ocean analogs. Specifically, these are the holomictic man-made gravel Lake Vechten in the Netherlands ( Koeksoy et al., 2016 ), as well as dimictic iron-rich Boreal Shield lakes (lakes L227 and L442 from the Experimental Lake Area in Canada) where molecular microbial and stable isotope data suggest that these lakes may be also good candidates to be studied as analogs of ancient oceans ( Schiff et al., 2016 ). 
       In  Table  1   we summarized the basic characteristics of most of the currently described meromictic ferruginous lakes. Mining lakes were excluded because of the acidic pH and strongly different biogeochemical conditions ( Boehrer et al., 2009 ). The best studied ferruginous systems are the lakes Pavin (France), Matano (Indonesia), La Cruz (Spain) and the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Even though most of these lakes show maximum iron concentrations largely overpassing those estimated for the Archean ferruginous oceans ( Table  1  ), iron concentrations at the photic anoxic zones of the lakes are lower, likely with higher resemblances to those estimated for the Archean ocean ( Holland, 2004 ;  Canfield, 2005 ;  Canfield et al., 2005 ). However, although it can be stated that iron was present at relatively high concentrations, there is a high uncertainty in the estimation of the iron concentrations in the Archean ocean, so only categorical comparisons can be made with some confidence. On the other hand, some of these iron-rich lakes are also known to accumulate high concentrations of methane and CO 2  in the bottom waters ( Crowe et al., 2011 ), which might cause catastrophic limnic eruptions, similar to what occurred in the African Lakes Nyos and Lagos ( Zhang and Kling, 2006 ;  Katsev et al., 2017 ). 
       
         Lake Pavin 
         Lake Pavin is a meromictic circular crater lake in the French Central Range (Massif Central) ( Bura-Nakic et al., 2009 ). Its permanent chemocline starts at 60 m depth and below the anoxic iron-rich monimolimnion extends to the lake bottom. In summer, a thermal stratification additionally occurs ( Aeschbach-Hertig et al., 2002 ). 
         Although sulfide is detectable in the anoxic waters, the high iron concentrations (maximum of up to 1200 μmol l -1 ) cause most of the sulfide to be in the form of colloidal iron sulfide ( Bura-Nakic et al., 2009 ). Meanwhile, isotope studies showed that most of the iron isotope variability observed in sedimentary pyrite can be tied to water column cycling foremost to the oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron ( Busigny et al., 2014 ). In fact, the sulfur cycle is one of the main active element cycles in this lake with (potentially chemolithoautotrophic) Epsilonproteobacteria (and apparently also non photosynthetic sulfur bacteria) playing a key role in the oxidative phase of the sulfur cycle ( Biderre-Petit et al., 2011a ). 16S rRNA gene sequences highly resembling the microaerophilic iron oxidizer  Gallionella ferruginea  were also abundantly retrieved in the upper part of the chemocline ( Lehours et al., 2007 ). Interestingly a highly diverse community of unicellular eukaryotes, mainly heterotrophic and mixotrophic microbes that could benefit from the abundant and diverse prokaryotic community ( Lehours et al., 2005 ,  2007 ) was found in the permanently anoxic zone of Lake Pavin ( Lepère et al., 2016 ). Methane is produced in the anoxic zone of the lake though mainly in the sediments, most of it not reaching the atmosphere, as a consequence of being oxidized mainly by aerobic methanotrophs ( Lopes et al., 2011 ), such as  Methylobacter  ( Biderre-Petit et al., 2011b ). 
         Although Lake Pavin has been considered as an Archean ocean analog, phototrophic iron oxidation has not been studied in detail in this lake. It is expected, however, that photoferrotrophy is of negligible importance due to the relatively great depth of the chemocline. Instead, most research on microbial mediated Fe-transformations in this lake has focused on facultative (e.g., fermentative) iron-reducing microorganisms (e.g.,  Lehours et al., 2009 ,  2010 ). 
       
       
         Lake Matano 
         The deep (590 m) stratified Lake Matano, being the largest, deepest, and oldest ferruginous basin known on Earth ( Crowe et al., 2014a ), was the first modern Archean ocean analog extensively studied as a possible environment where photoferrotrophy could occur ( Crowe et al., 2008a ). This tectonic lake, which covers 164 km 2 , is the headwater lake of the five morphologically diverse Malili lakes located on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. Lake Matano and the even larger Lake Towuti, whose ferruginous sediments have also been recently studied ( Vuillemin et al., 2016 ), are the biggest lakes in this lacustrine district. Despite weak temperature and vertical salinity gradients, stratification persisted over centuries in Lake Matano, aided by the low temperature fluctuations in this equatorial area during the year, and by the steep morphometry of the lake basin. Water renewal in the monimolimnion is estimated to take several hundred years ( Katsev et al., 2010 ,  2017 ). A quasi-permanent deep pycnocline (and chemocline) located at about 100–120 m separates an oxic upper layer from bottom waters, which are poor in sulfur but rich in methane and reduced iron, with Fe(II) originating from the Fe-rich soils in the catchment ( Crowe, 2008 ). 
         Phosphorus limitation controls primary production in the oxic layers of Lake Matano ( Crowe et al., 2008b ), which allows light penetration to the chemocline at 100 m depth, where reduced iron is available for a potential photoferrotrophic activity. Low-light adapted GSB containing bacteriochlorophyll- e  thrive in the photic chemocline of Lake Matano. Initial calculations based on sulfide availability suggested that the population densities of GSB could not be maintained by sulfide-dependent anoxygenic photosynthesis alone. Accordingly,  Crowe et al. (2008a)  proposed that a photoferrotrophic metabolism was implied to sustain their growth. However, GSB in Lake Matano are light limited and direct evidence for a photoferrotrophic activity could not yet be provided. Instead, more recent estimations ( Crowe et al., 2014a ) showed that the “slow growth and C-fixation rates suggest that the Lake Matano GSB can be supported by sulfide even though it only accumulates to scarcely detectable concentrations.” Moreover, barcoding community data demonstrate that GSB in this lake are related to known sulfide-oxidizing phototrophs ( Bryant et al., 2012 ) rather than to Fe(II)-oxidizing GSB. Since either photoheterotrophic growth or the use of H 2  as an electron donor could also support growth additionally to that provided by sulfide- or iron-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis, the possible occurrence of photoferrotrophy in the water column of Lake Matano would require stronger evidences. 
         Although apparently lower than previously reported (e.g.,  Crowe et al., 2011 ), active methanogenic degradation of organic matter occurs in Lake Matano, causing high methane accumulation in the anoxic bottom waters ( Crowe et al., 2011 ). Even though, recent modeling ( Kuntz et al., 2015 ) estimated that most organic carbon sinking to deep layers is buried in the sediments, ca. 9% is estimated to be degraded via methanogenesis and less than 3% could be degraded by anoxic ferric iron respiration. Part of the methane produced by both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenens (dominated by members of the order  Methanomicrobiales ;  Crowe et al., 2011 ) is oxidized at the chemocline. Meanwhile, anaerobic methane oxidation may be coupled to the reduction of Fe, and/or Mn ( Jones et al., 2011 ) (hydr)oxides or nitrogen oxides ( Sturm et al., 2016 ). As in the ancient oceans, the possible co-occurrence of photoferrotrophy, methanogenesis and iron-mediated anaerobic methane oxidation, establishes Lake Matano as a modern analog potentially harboring the main microbial metabolisms that were driving life in ancient Earth. 
       
       
         Lake La Cruz 
         Lake La Cruz (Laguna de la Cruz) is an iron-rich, biogenic meromictic lake located in the karstic system of Cañada del Hoyo (Cuenca, Central-Eastern Spain). The lake became meromictic around 1660 ( Julià et al., 1998 ;  Romero-Viana et al., 2010 ) and is located in a doline (sinkhole) with steep walls protecting the lake from winds. The lake is small, with a surface area of 0.017 km 2 , a maximum diameter of 136 m, and a maximum depth of 21 m. A monimolimnion rich in Ca 2+ , and Fe 2+ , as well as in HCO 3  - , CO 2  and CH 4 , is located in the deepest part of the lake, below a permanent chemocline starting at around 16 m. A seasonal thermal stratification develops in the warmest period and a temporary chemocline then appears from late spring to early summer above the permanent chemocline ( Rodrigo et al., 2001 ). Steep chemical gradients are found both at the bottom of the metalimnion (seasonally) and, permanently, at the stable chemocline (which extends from 16 to 18 m) that separates the mixolimnion from the monimolimnion ( Figure  3  ). The very low sulfide concentrations (&lt;0.2 μmol l -1  at the chemocline,  Oswald et al., 2016 ) compared to the high concentrations of dissolved reduced iron in the hypolimnion and the monimolimnion makes Lake La Cruz a potential Archean ocean analog were photoferrotrophy could occur.

         Surface waters of Lake La Cruz are depleted in nutrients as stratification advances, then phytoplankton becomes nutrient limited, thus increasing water transparency ( Picazo, 2016 ). Light penetrates selectively to deep layers, where sharply stratified planktonic populations of primary producers develop along the physical and chemical gradients of the water column ( Figure  3  ). In the oxic and microaerobic layers the photosynthetic planktonic assemblage is dominated by phycoerythrin-containing picocyanobacteria, resulting in a deep chlorophyll maximum at the bottom of the metalimnion during stratification ( Camacho et al., 2003 ;  Camacho, 2006 ), where light availability is around 1% of surface irradiance. Photosynthetic sulfur bacteria, both purple and green, thrive deeper within the anoxic iron-rich, sulfide-poor, waters of the hypolimnion and the monimolimnion ( Rodrigo et al., 2000 ;  Romero et al., 2006 ) ( Figure  3  ), being dominated by the PSB  Lamprocystis purpurea  and the GSB  Chlorobium clathratiforme  ( Casamayor et al., 2012 ), with the concomitant presence of  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  ( Walter et al., 2014 ). Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, including some linked to the iron cycle ( Walter, 2011 ), support important rates of dark inorganic carbon fixation that even exceed the contribution of anoxygenic photosynthesis to total carbon fixation in the lake ( Picazo, 2016 ). Nevertheless, inorganic carbon fixation in the lake is by far dominated by oxygenic photosynthesis, with the highest rates of inorganic carbon fixation ( Figure  3  ) occurring at the oxic-anoxic interface during the thermal stratification period ( Camacho et al., 2017 ). 
         Fe(III) has low concentrations along the water column of Lake La Cruz. Soluble Fe(II), however, is much more abundant in the anoxic waters, being oxidized in both the seasonal and the permanent chemoclines ( Figure  3  ). Aside of the possible chemical reaction with photosynthetically produced O 2  and the oxidation by microaerophilic chemotrophs in the upper part of the chemocline, photoferrotrophy likely occurs in anoxic waters.  Walter et al. (2014)  demonstrated that, in the anoxic photic zone,  in situ  inorganic carbon photoassimilation (measured in presence of DCMU, an inhibitor of the oxygenic photosynthesis thus avoiding oxygen release) was significantly higher in Fe(II) amended additions compared to non-amended batches and with those where sulfide or nitrate were added ( Figure  4A  ). This was observed only in the presence of light, which supports that photoferroautotrophic processes do occur. Moreover, longer incubations of these anoxic samples in a climatic chamber with Fe(II) additions and DCMU also resulted in Fe(II) oxidation only when exposed to light ( Figure  4B  ). Similarly, an enrichment culture of  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  showed the same behavior ( Figure  4C  ). The occurrence of light-dependent anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) in all these experiments represented the first consistent demonstration of photoferrotrophic activity at the chemocline of a modern Archean ocean analog. However, in Lake La Cruz photoferrotrophs ( C. ferrooxidans)  represent only a minor fraction of the anoxygenic phototrophic population, with the majority apparently thriving on sulfur cycling, despite the very low sulfur content in the ferruginous anoxic waters of the photic zone. This majority could potentially follow a similar metabolic path as that described in Lake Matano ( Crowe et al., 2014a ), within a cryptic sulfur cycle supported by the low concentrations of sulfide available at the chemocline where the low light availability could be co-limiting growth of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. Additionally, nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizers have also been found to be active at the chemocline, where they coexist with potential competitors, such as the photoferrotrophs who also utilize reduced iron, as well as with potentially syntrophic organisms ( Walter, 2011 ). The coexistence of phototrophic and nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizers could be explained by a day-night niche separation with only nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizers oxidizing Fe(II) in darkness and phototrophs dominating Fe(II) oxidation in daylight ( Melton et al., 2012 ).

         The major biogeochemical processes operating in the lake are summarized in  Figure  5  . The presented model integrates the iron, carbon, sulfur, and oxygen microbial cycles, including the metabolisms thought to have existed in the late Archean ocean ( Walter, 2011 ). Lake La Cruz thus represents an analog of the late Archean ocean, with oxygenated surface layers hosting oxygenic photosynthesis, overlying a ferruginous anoxic water column holding anoxygenic sulfide-dependent photosynthesis and anoxygenic photoferrotrophy, and with organic sediments where methanogenesis is the main organic mineralization pathway.

Below the epilimnion and metalimnion (1), the chemocline compartment (2) could be an analog to a Neoarchean ferruginous open ocean. However, as neither the deep monimolimnion nor the sediment compartment (3) demonstrate any Fe(III) accumulation it could also be an analog to the euxinic ocean margins characterizing the Neoarchean ocean. All processes from compartment (2) are established along the chemocline. The boundary between compartment (2) and (3) is conceptual and would be situated few centimeters above the sediment. Regular lines indicate biological processes, curved arrows illustrate diffusion/sedimentation processes and broken lines represent chemical processes.

         Lake Kivu 
         Lake Kivu ( Descy et al., 2012 ) is a large (2370 km 2 ), deep (485 m), tropical meromictic lake located between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. This lake, of tectonic origin, is the highest of the East African Rift Lakes. This is a very active geological volcanic area with hydrothermal influences on lake deep water layers, which slightly disturb the meromictic conditions ( Katsev et al., 2017 ) created by the vertical salinity gradient originated by salt inputs coming from subaquatic groundwater discharges ( Schmid and Wüest, 2012 ;  Ross et al., 2015 ). The mixolimnion is separated from the monimolimnion, where hydrogen sulfide accumulates to concentrations of ca. 0.3 mM ( Pasche et al., 2011 ;  Llirós et al., 2015 ), by a permanent chemocline located at ∼65 m ( Llirós et al., 2012 ). Large amounts of methane and CO 2  accumulate in the deep monimolimnion, with the corresponding risk of limnic gas eruptions ( Zhang and Kling, 2006 ;  Hirslund, 2012 ). However, methanotrophs, mainly close relatives of type X CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria ( Pasche et al., 2011 ), very actively oxidize methane ( Morana et al., 2015b ), mostly aerobically in the oxycline, driving low methane release to the atmosphere ( Morana et al., 2015a ;  Zigah et al., 2015 ). Nutrient availability in upper layers is low, with average mixolimnetic chlorophyll-a concentrations of 2.2 mg m -3 . Phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms during the dry season and by cyanobacteria, mainly phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria ( Sarmento et al., 2008 ) during the rainy season, with total phytoplankton biomass of 143–278 g C m -2  y -1  ( Darchambeau et al., 2014 ). The microbial communities of Lake Kivu have been studied in several basins of the lake ( Llirós et al., 2010 ,  2012 ,  2015 ;  Plasencia et al., 2010 ), and their stratified distribution suggest well-defined functional specialization ( Inceoğlu et al., 2015a ), with highest microbial richness in the anoxic zone ( Inceoğlu et al., 2015b ). Brown-colored species of GSB permanently developed at 11 m depth in Kabuno Bay and sporadically in the anoxic waters of the main basin ( Llirós et al., 2012 ,  2015 ). 
         Kabuno Bay, where  in situ  photoferrotrophy has been reported ( Llirós et al., 2015 ), is separated from the main basin by a shallow (∼7 m) volcanic sill that restricts water exchange with the main basin. Kabuno Bay, with a maximum depth of 150 m, has a steep pycnocline around 10 m depth ( Katsev et al., 2014 ), with a very narrow oxycline and a ferruginous water column below with up to 1.2 mM of Fe(II) deriving from hydrothermal sublacustrine sources ( Llirós et al., 2015 ). Light penetrates well into the Fe(II)-rich, sulfide poor (0.6 μM maximum in the illuminated chemocline), anoxic waters, with GSB comprising up to 30% of the total microbial community in the chemocline. Anoxygenic phototrophs also include PSB and  Chloroflexi , though being less abundant. The Bchl- e -containing GSB were isolated and sequenced, being closely related to  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  strain KoFox (DSM strain 13031). Anoxygenic phototrophs largely dominated CO 2  fixation in the illuminated redoxcline of Kabuno Bay ( Morana et al., 2016 ). Light-dependent Fe(II) oxidation rates of up to 100 μmol Fe l -1  d -1  have been reported ( Llirós et al., 2015 ) at the chemocline, much higher than those reported for lakes Matano and La Cruz ( Table  1  ), and the photoferrotrophic contribution to CO 2  fixation in the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu by these anoxygenic phototrophs was significant. A tightly coupled pelagic Fe-oxidation-reduction cycle was observed, with much higher rates than those of sulfate reduction and potential sulfide oxidation ( Llirós et al., 2015 ). Actually, rates of photoferrotrophy in the Kabuno Bay water column (3.4 mol C m -2  yr -1 ) are within the range of those modeled for global photoferrotrophic production in Earth’s early ferruginous oceans (1.4 mol C m -2  yr -1 ) ( Llirós et al., 2015 ). Contrasting to  C. ferrooxidans  KoFox, the Kabuno Bay GSB isolate appears to be specifically adapted to the pelagic habitat, contains Bchl- e  (conferring low-light adaptation) instead of Bchl- c , and grows in pure culture instead of in co-culture. Incubation experiments with the Kabuno Bay isolate also demonstrate its capacity to grow photoferrotrophically under very low light conditions (i.e., 0.64 μ E m -2  s -1 ) apparently oxidizing Fe(II) at a rate of 1.4 mmol l -1  d -1  ( Llirós et al., 2015 ). 
       
     
     
       Some Concluding Remarks and Perspectives 
       Our knowledge on photoferrotrophy and its past and current significance has tremendously increased in the last decade. We now have evidence from pure cultures as well as from environmental studies that this metabolism could have been a significant process in the early times of our planet, but also that it remains as a relict example of how this primitive Earth may have been functioning during hundreds of millions years. These advances likely place photoferrotrophy among the oldest photosynthetic processes on Earth, probably playing an important biogeochemical role during most of the Archean Eon. It has also been demonstrated that oceans evolved from predominantly reduced to the current oxidized conditions. Interestingly, these primordial anoxic ferruginous conditions still prevail in environments such as the iron-rich meromictic lakes. The study of these modern analogs of primitive oceans has revealed that in many of them GSB related to  Chlorobium ferrooxidans  are the main photoferrotrophs, but also that the current ecological and biogeochemical significance of photoferrotrophy is minor. Moreover, even when photoferrotrophs are abundant in an anoxic, iron rich, natural environment, sulfur driven anoxygenic photosynthesis still plays an important or dominant role despite the typically very low sulfide concentrations in ferruginous systems. This, in addition to the fact that bacterial anoxygenic photosynthesis is restricted to small compartments of the modern biosphere, implies that the current ecological relevance of Fe(II)-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis is circumstantial. Exploring photoferrotrophy, however, provides insights into how photosynthesis appeared on Earth and how it progressively shaped the biogeochemistry of our planet.

         Diverse communities of bacteria colonize plant roots and the rhizosphere. Many of these rhizobacteria are symbionts and provide plant growth promotion (PGP) services, protecting the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing plant productivity by providing access to nutrients that would otherwise be unavailable to roots. In return, these symbiotic bacteria receive photosynthetically-derived carbon (C), in the form of sugars and organic acids, from plant root exudates. PGP activities have been characterized for a variety of forest tree species and are important in C cycling and sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. The molecular mechanisms of these PGP activities, however, are less well-known. In a previous analysis of  Pseudomonas  genomes, we found that the bacterial transportome, the aggregate activity of a bacteria's transmembrane transporters, was most predictive for the ecological niche of Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere. Here, we used  Populus tremuloides  Michx. (trembling aspen) seedlings inoculated with one of three  Pseudomonas fluorescens  strains (Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6) and one  Pseudomonas protegens  (Pf-5) as a laboratory model to further investigate the relationships between the predicted transportomic capacity of a bacterial strain and its observed PGP effects in laboratory cultures. Conditions of low nitrogen (N) or low phosphorus (P) availability and the corresponding replete media conditions were investigated. We measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of  P. tremuloides  seedlings and correlated  P. fluorescens  strain-specific transportomic capacities with  P. tremuloides  seedling phenotype to predict the strain and nutrient environment-specific transporter functions that lead to experimentally observed, strain, and media-specific PGP activities and the capacity to protect plants against nutrient stress. These predicted transportomic functions fall in three groups: (i) transport of compounds that modulate aspen seedling root architecture, (ii) transport of compounds that help to mobilize nutrients for aspen roots, and (iii) transporters that enable bacterial acquisition of C sources from seedling root exudates. These predictions point to specific molecular mechanisms of PGP activities that can be directly tested through future, hypothesis-driven biological experiments.

       Introduction 
       Forest ecosystems are major components of the biosphere and contribute extensive ecosystem services. Trees form a significant storage sink in the global carbon (C) cycle, facilitate water fluxes in the hydrologic cycle, and provide wood and fiber for human consumption. The provision of these benefits depends upon the supply and utilization of resources (carbon dioxide, water, nutrients, and light) to and by the tree. However, photosynthesis and primary productivity are often limited by nutrient availability (Houlton et al.,  2008 ; Reich et al.,  2009 ; St. Clair et al.,  2009 ), which, in turn, affects the ecological roles and economic output of forests. 
       The plant rhizosphere hosts a large and diverse community of microbes whose interactions with roots and soils influence ecosystem productivity (Lambers et al.,  2009 ; Morgan et al.,  2010 ; Cumming et al.,  2015 ). 
       Interaction between roots and plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria specifically play critical roles in enhancing the acquisition of nutrients from soils for the plant host and enhance host niche breath and stress resistance (Rodriguez and Fraga,  1999 ; Barea et al.,  2005 ; Compant et al.,  2010 ). While some aspects of the resource exchange underlying PGP interactions have been described (Morgan et al.,  2005 ; Lambers et al.,  2009 ; Frey-Klett et al.,  2011 ), an increased understanding of these interactions would enhance potential management applications, such as biofuel feedstock production, soil remediation, and C sequestration activities. 
        Pseudomonas fluorescens  is commonly found soil bacteria and abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in  Populus  rhizosphere samples (Gottel et al.,  2011 ; Brown et al.,  2012 ). Many  P. fluorescens  strains are categorized as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR; Cook et al.,  1995 ). These benefits may be accrued from changes in nutrient availability in the rhizosphere, alterations in host hormonal balance increasing stress resistance, and/or changes in the community of microbes interacting with plant roots (Frey-Klett et al.,  2011 ; Cumming et al.,  2015 ). Some proposed molecular mechanisms for PGP activity include the export of organic acids and siderophores that facilitate dissolution of P in soils (Kurek et al.,  2013 ; Giles et al.,  2014 ; Pastor et al.,  2014 ) and the secretion of phosphatases and phytases that mineralize organic P in the plant rhizosphere (Giles et al.,  2014 ; Pastor et al.,  2014 ).  Pseudomonas  strains have nutrient environment-dependent PGP effects on a variety of crop and tree species, including  Solanum lycopersicon  (Pastor et al.,  2014 ),  Nicotiana tabacum  (Giles et al.,  2014 ),  Oryza sativa  (Habibi et al.,  2014 ), and  Malus domestica  (Kurek et al.,  2013 ). These strain-specific effects on plants can be, in significant part, attributable to differences in  Pseudomonas  transportomes (Silby et al.,  2009 ; Larsen et al.,  2015 ). Transportome is defined here as the relative capacity to transport specific substances across the cell membrane as a function of the set of transmembrane transporters in the genome. An investigation of these differential transportomic capacities of PGP strains and of their correlation with measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of  Populus tremuloides  seedlings would highlight potential molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizosphere community's specific contributions to plants' acclimation to stress, C sequestration capacity, and the maintenance of productivity under suboptimal conditions. 
       We have evaluated the effect of four different strains of  Pseudomonas  on  P. tremuloides  (trembling aspen, “aspen”) seedlings in replete media and under conditions of low nitrogen (N) and low phosphorus (P). The evolutionarily distinct  Pseudomonas  strains we chose for this study were Pf0-1, Pf-5, SBW25, and WH6 (Paulsen et al.,  2005 ; Silby et al.,  2009 ; Kimbrel et al.,  2010 ; Loper et al.,  2012 ). Sixteen phenotypic measures of aspen seedlings were collected and computational models of  Pseudomonas  metabolism related to each strain genome were generated. By identifying significant correlations between seedling phenotype colonized by a  Pseudomonas  strains with strain-specific transportomic capacities under different nutrient stress conditions, we were able to predict molecular mechanisms of strain and nutrient stress-specific PGP. 
     
     
       Methods 
       
         Aspen seedling and  Pseudomonas  resources 
          P. tremuloides  Michx. and strains of  P. fluorescens  were cultured together in a laboratory model system. Aspen seeds were obtained from the National Tree Seed Center, Natural Resources Canada, Fredericton NB, Canada. The four  Pseudomonas  strains used in this study were  P. protegens  Pf-5 [ATCC (American Type Cell Culture) Catalog# BAA-477],  P. fluorescens  Pf0-1 (Garbeva et al.,  2011 ),  P. fluorescens  SBW25 (Preston et al.,  2001 ), and  P. fluorescens  WH6 (Banowetz et al.,  2008 ). 
       
       
         Aspen seedling- Pseudomonas  vertical plate cultures 
         Aspen seedling- Pseudomonas  communities and non-inoculated aspen controls were grown in a vertical plate system under three nutrient regimes: replete, low nitrogen (N), and low phosphorus (P). Experiments were performed using 12 replicate vertical plates per treatment and 8 aspen seedlings per plate for a total of 180 plates and 1,440 aspen seedlings. All data are reported as averages of seedling values from each replicate vertical plate. 
         Aspen seeds were surface sterilized by washing once with 2% Tween and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite followed by several washes of sterile water. Sterilized seeds were soaked in sterile water in the dark overnight and germinated in jars (Sigma product # V8630) containing 1% Phytablend (Caisson Laboratories, Inc.) for 10 day. Jars were maintained in a growth chamber with 14/10 h light/dark cycle with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 200 μmol m −2  s −1 , temperature regime of 25/20°C, and constant 75% relative humidity before being transferred to the vertical plates (Petri Dishes 150 × 15 mm). 
         Following the 10 d germination period, seedlings were transferred to a vertical plate system with one of three nutrient treatments. Replete media contained 4 mM NH 4 NO 3 ,1 mM CaSO 4 , 1.5 mM K 2 SO 4 , 0.5 mM MgSO 4 , and 1.5 mM KH 2 PO 4 . Low-N media substituted 150 μM NH 4 NO 3  (3.75% of replete media concentration) and low-P media substituted 25 μM KH 2 PO 4  (1.67% of replete media concentration). Solution pH was adjusted to 5.6 with 0.1 N NaOH in each case. Each vertical plate (150 × 15 mm) contained 100 ml of solidified media with half removed to create a headspace for seedling shoots. Washed autoclaved cellophane membrane (Promega, Gel Drying Film, REF V7131) was placed on the half medium. Seedlings were transferred carefully from the germination jars to the cellophane membrane. Each plate contained 8 seedlings, placed at 15 mm intervals. The plates were incubated at a 75° angle in the growth chamber under conditions noted above. 
         After 1-week incubation, seedlings were inoculated with the  Pseudomonas  strains. For inoculation into vertical plates,  Pseudomonas  cultures were grown overnight in LB liquid media at 27°C. Bacterial pellets were collected and washed with sterile 10 mM MgSO 4 . Pellets were re-suspended in 0.25-strength Johnson's nutrient solution (1.2 mM NO3, 100 μM P, 0.4 mM NH4, 0.5 mM K, 0.2 mM Ca, 0.1 mM Mg, 0.1 mM SO4, 50.5 μM Cl, 20 μM Fe, 20 μM B, 2 μM Mn and Zn, and 0.5 μM Cu, Na, Co, and Mo. Solution pH was adjusted to 5.6 with 0.1 N HCl; Desai et al.,  2014 ) at an estimated bacterial cell concentration of ~1.0 × 10 9  (OD 600 nm = 1.0). Each seedling root was inoculated with 10 μl of bacterial suspension (~10 7  cells) or with 10 μl of sterile Johnson's solution. Seedlings were harvested 35 days following bacterial inoculation for phenotype measurements. As in previously published experimental results (Anith et al.,  2004 ; Rojas-Tapias et al.,  2012 ; Majeed et al.,  2015 ), the biomass of bacteria was not collected at the end of incubation and the presence of bacteria was considered only as an experimental treatment in subsequent analyses. 
       
       
         Aspen seedling phenotype assays 
         A total of 16 phenotypic measurements were collected from aspen seedlings at the end of the experiment. These included shoot dry weight (mg), shoot length (mm), number of leaves, leaf chlorophyll (Chl) concentration (μg mg −1  FW), chl a/b ratio, shoot anthocyanin concentration (μg mg −1  FW), shoot       NO   3  −      concentration (mg g −1  DW), shoot P concentration (mg g −1  DW), root dry weight (mg), root branching (integer value), root length (cm), number of rootlets, root anthocyanin concentration (μg mg −1  FW), root total N (%), root       NO   3  −      concentration (μg g −1  DW), and root P concentration (mg g −1  DW). Experiments were harvested after 35 days of co-culture. All plates were visually inspected for bacterial or fungal colonies and contaminated plates were discarded. Plant phenotypes corresponding to physical parameters such as shoot length, number of leaves, root length, root branching, and number of rootlets were measured on all seedlings in at least 10 replicate plates per treatment. 
         Phenotypes that entailed destruction of the samples, such as dry weight (shoot and root), leaf chl, chl a/b ratio, shoot anthocyanin, shoot       NO   3  −     , shoot P, root anthocyanin, root total percent N, root       NO   3  −     , and root P were measured on 3 replicate plates per treatment. For dry weight measurements, 4 seedlings were collected from each replicate plate, dried at 65°C for 72 h, and shoot and root tissues separately weighed. Dry tissue was also used for measuring P, and total N concentrations (below). Other biochemical assays (leaf chl, chl a/b ratio, shoot anthocyanin, shoot       NO   3  −     , shoot P, root anthocyanin, root total percent N, root       NO   3  −     ) were performed using two seedlings per plate per treatment. 
         Chlorophyll was extracted from whole shoots using cold methanol and quantified according to Porra et al. ( 1989 ). Anthocyanins were extracted from root and shoot tissue separately with acidified methanol (1% HCl) and quantified according to Neff and Chory ( 1998 ). All assays were adjusted relative to the original protocols to reflect lower biomass amounts and analyzed using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). 
         For analysis of tissue       NO   3  −      concentration, dry root or shoot tissue (~10 mg dry weight) was ground and suspended in 300 μl d·H 2 O and kept at 50°C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, samples were centrifuged, and 100 μl of supernatant was collected. The nitrate in samples was converted to nitrosalicylic acid by reaction with salicylic acid in concentrated sulfuric acid, and its concentration was then determined spectrophotometrically (Lastra,  2003 ). Total tissue N was determined on dried root (~5 mg dry weight) by combustion with a Carlo Erba NA 1,500 elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba Strumentazione, Milan, Italy) using acetanilide as a standard. To determine the P concentration of plant root and shoot tissue, dried tissue was ashed at 475°C for 2.5 h, dissolved in 200 μl of 50% concentrated HCl (Sigma ACS reagent), and the crucible rinsed with 800 μl of d·H 2 O and combined with the digest. The resulting 1-ml digests were vortexed until clear, and 100 μl of sample diluted with 100 μl d·H 2 O was used to detect inorganic P using the malachite green method (Martin et al.,  1999 ). 
       
       
         Analysis of aspen seedling phenotypes 
         Seedling phenotypes were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA, with the factors being “community” (no bacteria, Pf0-1, Pf-5, SBW25, WH6; 4° of freedom) and “media” (replete, low N, and low P media; 2° of freedom) using “MeV” (v4.5.1,  http://www.tm4.org/mev.html ). Thresholds for significance were  p  &lt; 0.05, based on 10,000 permutations. 
         A matrix of Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) scores between all pair-wise aspen phenotype measurements across all experimental conditions was generated to identify strong positive and negative correlations between seedling phenotypic measures (95th and 5th percentile of PCC scores, respectively). Strong correlations were visualized as a network (Cytoscape v2.8.0,  http://cytoscape.org ). 
         Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed on seedling phenotypic data. Seedling phenotype were clustered by hierarchical clustering and grouped by PCA using Euclidian distance in R (R v3.0.3). Important principal components (PCs) were considered to be those whose variance exceeded what would be observed if variance were distributed equally across all PCs. Relevant loading values in important PCs from PCA analysis were considered to be those whose absolute value exceeded (1/number of PCs) 0.5 . 
       
       
         Transportomic modeling 
         Transportomic capacity of  Pseudomonas  strains was calculated as Predicted Relative Transmembrane Transport (PRTT) scores, as described in Larsen et al. ( 2015 ). Briefly all four  Pseudomonas  strains were re-annotated for transporter and sensor functions to insure uniformity of annotations across strains using a custom database of 164,321 protein sequences, annotated with any of 891 KEGG Orthology (KO) annotations (Table  S1 ). Transporter/sensor annotations are associated with one or more of 272 possible ligands. Function was ascribed to a bacterial protein if BLAST-N alignment with &gt;20% sequence similarity and  e  &lt; 1e −100 . PRTT is a metric that quantifies the relative capacity of a bacterium to transport a ligand across its membrane as a function of the number of genes annotated with transporter functions in its genome. A positive PRTT score indicates an increased relative capacity for transmembrane transport of a specific ligand in the transportome in one bacterium relative to the average transportomic capacity of a set of bacteria. A negative PRTT score indicates a decreased relative capacity for transmembrane transport of a ligand. A PRTT score alone does not necessarily indicate the direction of transport, i.e., import or export, and requires consideration of specific protein annotations. Note that ligand identifications are drawn from the ontology of KEGG compounds and may contain redundant or overlapping terms (e.g., “iron” and “Fe2+”) necessitating additional investigation into the specific transporter proteins or annotations. Table  S2  contains the necessary information for readers to make the required associations between ligand, annotation, and predicted  Pseudomonas  protein. 
       
       
         Correlations between aspen seedling phenotypes and transportomes 
         Statistically significant correlations between significantly different phenotypes and transportomic models were identified. As the transportomic models are dependent only upon  Pseudomonas  genomic annotation, the matrix of PRTT scores associated with a  Pseudomonas  strain is the same regardless of media condition. Three sets of correlations were considered: Phenotypes significant by community for all media types; phenotypes significant for community-media interaction for only low N stress condition; and phenotypes significant for community-media interaction for only low P stress condition. Statistical significance of the correlations was assigned using a bootstrap approach, randomly re-ordering phenotypes 5,000 times, and determining the frequency at which absolute value of bootstrapped correlations was greater than absolute value of initial correlations. This frequency was expressed as a  p -value and a significance threshold of  p  ≤ 0.05 was used. 
         As it is expected that this correlation network will contain false positive interactions, the network was reduced by filtering for edges in the network between nodes that are significantly enriched for specific strain, media condition, or direction of correlations (calculated as a cumulative hypergeometric distribution,  p  &lt; 0.05). The filtered network is comprised of 14 aspen seedling phenotypes and 103  Pseudomonas  transported ligands, connected by 122 statistically significant correlation edges. All subsequent analysis was performed using this filtered network. 
       
     
     
       Results 
       
         Aspen seedling phenotypic analysis 
         Aspen seedling phenotypes were assessed under five “community” conditions (no bacteria, Pf0-1, Pf-5, SBW25, WH6) and three “media” conditions (replete, low N, and low P). A summary of collected quantitative phenotypes can be found in Table  1  and the complete set of collected data can be found in Table  S3 . Representative seedling vertical plate cultures are pictured in Figure  1 . By two-way ANOVA, media composition differentiated 14 (88%) phenotypic characters, 12 (75%) separated by  Pseudomonas  community, and 8 (50%) by the interaction of media and community (Table  1 ). In aspen seedlings without  Pseudomonas , N and P limitation led to 52 and 53% reductions in total seedling biomass, respectively (Table  1 ). Thus, it is clear that nutrient resources limited aspen growth in the delivered low N and P treatments. In addition, the inoculation with four  P. fluorescens  strains resulted in 42% (shoot) and 33% (root) average biomass increases relative to non-bacterial controls in replete nutrient conditions (Table  1 ), indicating that, in aggregate, the  Pseudomonas  strains confer PGP benefits.

              Impact of PGPB on aspen seedlings under conditions of low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) . Aspen seedlings inoculated with bacterial strains indicated on the left and grown under replete (4 mM N, 1.5 mM P) or nutrient limiting conditions (low N 150 μM, low P 25 μM) indicated on the top of the image. 
           
           
         
         
           Low N and P conditions alter pigments in aspen seedlings 
           Three phenotypic measures were solely influenced by media treatment (total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a/b, root anthocyanin; Table  1 ). Considering average values across the 5 community treatments, total chlorophyll in seedlings grown with low N was 57% of that in seedlings grown with replete media but the chlorophyll a/b ratio did not change. In contrast, total chlorophyll in low P derived seedlings was intermediate between replete and low N plants, yet the chlorophyll a/b ratio was ~75% of that in the other media treatments (Table  1 ). Root anthocyanin concentration was strongly stimulated by both N limitation (3.1-fold) and P limitation (3.2-fold) across all treatments. This effect was particularly strong in non-bacterial aspen seedlings where anthocyanin concentration increased 7.2-fold in low N and 5.4-fold in low P relative to replete condition (Table  1 ). However, in replete media the presence of  Pseudomonas  strains increased 2- to 3-fold root anthocyanin accumulation (Table  1 ). These observations suggest that anthocyanin accumulation in aspen seedling roots can be induced by multiple environmental cues including nutrient limitation and the presence of bacteria. 
         
         
            Pseudomonas  affects P acquisition in aspen 
           Shoot P was the only phenotype solely influenced  Pseudomonas  community (Table  1 ). Across media conditions, seedlings co-cultured with Pf-5 and Pf0-1 exhibited 1.6- and 2-fold greater shoot P content relative to seedlings without bacteria, respectively; SBW25 and WH6 did not differ from non-bacterial aspen (Table  1 ). Root P accumulation decreased 3.7-fold in non-bacterial seedlings grown with low P relative to replete media. Co-culture of seedlings with all  Pseudomonas  strains elevated root P concentration relative to non-bacterial seedlings, with strongest effect for strains WH6 (2.1-fold) and Pf0-1 (2.2-fold). Taken in aggregate, total P accumulation (μg plant −1 , calculated as Root DW × Root P + Shoot DW × Shoot P) was significantly greater in all  Pseudomonas -colonized plants compared to non-bacterial plants and exhibited strain-specific differences in the order Pf0-1 (28.9) = Pf-5 (22.5) = WH6 (18.8) &gt; SBW25 (12.4) &gt; non-bacterial control (7.3). 
         
         
            Pseudomonas  co-culture and media have a combinatorial effect on aspen seedling phenotypes 
           Most aspen phenotypes responded to combinations of media and  Pseudomonas  community or their interaction (Table  1 ), indicating that PGP bacteria mediate aspen response to abiotic resource availability. PCA of seedling phenotypic data identified five PCs that together accounted for 80% of the total variance (Figure  S1 ). The first two PCs, which account for 43% of the variance (Table  S4 ), can be linked to specific culture conditions. The first PC includes six phenotypic characters (leaf chlorophyll concentration, leaf count, shoot length, shoot dry weight, root %N, and root length; Figure  2 ), highlighting shoot-root tradeoffs as aspen seedlings increased root elongation as a N acquisition strategy. The second PC also includes root growth relationships and seedling N nutrition, specifically feedbacks between tissue       NO   3  −      accumulation and root architecture (Figure  2 ). PC3 separates anthocyanin responses and root P, suggesting this PC encompasses aspen stress-response to P acquisition. Graphically, PCA clustering of data indicates a distinct grouping of data, with low N, low P, and presence of  Pseudomonas  each having distinctive effects on aspen seedling phenotypes (Figure  2 ).

                Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of aspen seedling phenotypes . A scatter plot of the first two PC is shown. Each point is a single observation, drawn from average values of individual seedlings on a vertical plate. Shape indicates culture condition: no bacteria are circles, Pf-5 are triangles, Pf0-1 are crosses, SBW25 are × 's, and WH6 are diamonds. Nutrient condition is indicated by color: replete media is black, low N media is blue, and low P media is red. In PCA plot, blue, red, and black labels have been added to highlight the effects of colonization by bacteria and the effects of nutrient stress. Labeled arrows are the eigenvectors associated with seedling phenotype measure. 
             
             
           
         
         
           Pseudomonads provide strain-specific benefits to aspen seedlings 
           Patterns of aspen seedling shoot and root architecture and biomass (Table  1 ) indicate that Pseudomonads generally increase C allocation to roots under both N and P limitation relative to non-bacterial seedlings, and these changes, while variable among strains, may underpin PGP effects. Strain SBW25 promoted an increase in several seedling shoot phenotypes (chlorophyll, number of leaves, shoot length, shoot DW) in replete media condition. However, these positive effects were not observed under nutrient limitation where seedlings co-cultured with SBW25 performed similarly to non-bacterial seedlings. Under N limiting conditions, root length increased markedly (2.1-fold) and root mass decreased slightly (0.76-fold) in non-bacterial seedlings relative to replete conditions. For seedlings grown in low N media and inoculated with Pf0-1, WH6, and Pf-5, and to a lesser extent with SBW25, root mass was increased (up to 3-fold) and root length declined (up to 0.76-fold) relative to non-bacterial seedlings. Low N also reduced shoot length (0.5-fold) and shoot mass (0.38-fold) in non-bacterial seedlings relative to replete conditions. Under N limitation, Pf-5, Pf0-1, and WH6 restored shoot length and shoot mass to levels greater than that of the non-bacterial control in replete media. 
           Under P limitation, root length and root mass of non-bacterial seedlings decreased 0.57- and 0.38-fold, respectively, relative to replete conditions. Strain Pf-5 was the most efficient at increasing root length (2.3-fold) and root mass (4.5-fold) under low P compared to non-bacterial treatments. Strains Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6 also had positive effects, restoring root length and mass above the non-bacterial control with replete media (Table  1 ). Low P also reduced shoot mass (0.57-fold) and shoot length (0.84-fold) in non-bacterial seedlings relative to replete conditions. Strain WH6 maintained shoot mass under low P to levels similar to that observed for  Pseudomonas -treated seedlings in replete media. Of note, these strains did not affect shoot length under P limitation. Together, these observations suggest that  Pseudomonas  treatments increase resource allocation to root and shoot in a strain-specific manner under N and P limitation. These PGP effects and alleviation of stress likely result from multiple and strain-specific PGP mechanisms functioning under different resource environments. 
         
       
       
          Pseudomonas  strains have unique transportomic capacities 
         While statistically significant differences in aspen phenotypes suggest  Pseudomonas  strain-specific beneficial effects that depend on nutrient availability, the statistical analysis does not provide information on the molecular mechanisms underpinning these beneficial effects. The relative transportomic capacity of  Pseudomonas  strains Pf-5, Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6 were quantified using PRTT-scores. There are 199 ligands in the calculated  Pseudomonas  transportome, and the complete set of PRTT-scores can be found in Table  S4  and is summarized as a hierarchical cluster and heat map in Figure  3 . 
         
           Figure 3 
           
              Heat map and hierarchical cluster of   Pseudomonas   strain PRTT-scores . In this heat map, rows are  Pseudomonas  strains and columns are specific ligands. Values in heat map are PRTT-scores. 
           
           
         
         Different  Pseudomonas  strains can be distinguished by their unique profile of strongest transportomic capacity, defined here as having a PRTT-score for a specific ligand that is at least 2-fold greater than the average PRTT score for the other strains. 
         
           
             Pf0-1: Mangenese, lipopolysaccharide, putrescine, microcin, iron, Fe 2+ , Fe 3+ , chloramphenicol, hemolysin, mineral and organic ion transporters, and spermidine. 
           
           
             Pf-5: Pores ion channels, L-arginine, L-ornithine, zinc cation, sorbitol, glycine, trimethylamine-n-oxide, n-acetylglucosamine, tungstate, lactose, alpha-glucoside, teichoic acid, sulfate, tetracycline, maltodextrin, l-threonine, and SN-glycerol 3-phosphate. 
           
           
             SBW25: L-glutamine, nickel, nickel 2+ , L-leucine, glucose, L-arabinose, peptide, ribose, sodium cation, cytosine, thymine, electrochemical potential-driven transporters, spermidine, putrescine, uracil, L-isoeucine, L-valine, dimethyl sulfoxide, fructose, multidrug transporters, xylose, l-aspartate, l-glutamate, adenine, nucleoside, formate, ascorbate, and oxalate. 
           
           
             WH6: Cobamide coenzyme, peptide, ABC-2 type and other transporters, fructose, L-aspartate, L-glutamate, nitrate, nickel, nickel 2+ , ribose, mannose, L-proline, unknown transporters, gluconate, lipoprotein, cytosine, and thymine. 
           
         
         With 29 ligands, WH6 has the most unique transportomic capacities relative to the other strains. 
         From the hierarchical cluster (HCL) figure of PRTT-scores (Figure  3 ), the transportomic capacity of Pf-5 and Pf0-1 are more similar to one another than the other strains and WH6 and SBW25 are more similar to one another than the others. The transportomic capacities that distinguish Pf-5 and Pf0-1 from WH6 and SBW25 (by  t -test,  p  &lt; 0.05) are for the ligands galactarate, 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic, trehalose, C4-dicarboxylate, lactate, drug transporters, cadaverine, D-allose, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, dehydroshikimate, shikimate, and iron. 
       
       
         Aspen seedling phenotype and  Pseudomonas  transportome correlation networks 
         In order to identify potential mechanisms by which the observed  Pseudomonas  strain-specific differences in aspen seedling phenotypes might be linked to differential transportomic capacities, we considered the correlation network generated between observed aspen seedling phenotype measurements and predicted  Pseudomonas  transportomes. 
         
           Aspen seedling phenotypes are not independent of one another 
           Intuitively, it seems likely that all aspen seedling phenotypes are not independent of one another. For example, root length and root dry weight might reasonably be expected to correlate, as might be number of leaves and above ground shoot dry weight. To better understand how  Pseudomonas  transportomic capacity might be linked to aspen seedling phenotypes, we first considered how those seedling phenotypes might be interdependent on one another by constructing a correlation network between phenotypic measurements (Figure  4 ). This network is comprised of 16 nodes and 11 edges. Chlorophyll a/b, shoot P, root N, and rootlets do not appear in the set of significantly correlated phenotypes. The network is comprised of three connected subnetworks: mostly belowground phenotypes, aboveground phenotypes, and anthocyanins. In the aboveground network, shoot dry weight, leaf count, stem length, and chlorophyll concentrations are positively correlated. Root and shoot anthocyanins are positively correlated. The belowground subnetwork is comprised entirely of negative correlations between root phenotypes and between root architecture (branching, length, and dry weight) and shoot       NO   3  −      concentration. 
           
             Figure 4 
             
                Network of correlated aspen seedling phenotypes . In this network, nodes are measured seedling phenotypes, solid edges indicate strong positive correlations, and dashed edges indicate strong negative correlations. The phenotypes for root and shoot P concentration do not correlate strongly with any phenotypes. 
             
             
           
         
         
           Correlations networks between aspen seedling phenotypes and  Pseudomonas  transportomes predict molecular mechanisms of PGP 
           Possible mechanisms linking changes in seedling phenotype to relative, differential transportomic capacity of co-cultured  Pseudomonas  strains were sought by identifying significant correlations between transportomic capacity (expressed as PRTT-scores, and available in Table  S5 ) and phenotypes (Table  S2 ). The initial network (Table  S6 ) is comprised of a completely connected network with 143  Pseudomonas -transported ligands, 15 aspen seedling phenotypes, and 219 statistically significant ( p  &lt; 0.05) correlations between ligands and phenotypes. Edges are categorized as positively or negatively correlated, with the majority (80%) of statistically significant edges being positive correlations. Ligands were categorized by the  Pseudomonas  strain with the highest PRTT-score for that ligand. Highest PRTT-score ligands were fairly evenly distributed between Pf0-1 (21%), Pf-5 (23%), WH6 (26%), and SBW25 (30%). 
           The complete correlation network was refined to include only enriched interaction classes (Table  2 ) and the resulting network was comprised of 14 phenotypes and 103  Pseudomonas  transportomic functions, linked by 131 interactions (Figure  5 ). Predictions of molecular mechanisms of PGP in subsequent Discussion Section utilize this, refined network in analyses.

       Discussion 
       Interactions between aspen seedlings and  Pseudomonas  strains under varying nutrient environments provide insight into how PGP benefits of this rhizobacteria could be linked to the annotated function of transmembrane transporter proteins. Key observations include: (i) low N and low P induce stress in non-bacterial seedlings under these experimental conditions; (ii)  Pseudomonas  can ameliorate nutrient limitation in strain and media-specific fashions; (iii)  Pseudomonas  strains have unique transportomic capacities; and (iv) there are significant correlations between aspen seedling phenotype and  Pseudomonas  transportomes. From these analyses, it becomes possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms underlying strain and media-specific effects of  Pseudomonas -aspen PGP interactions. 
       
         Analysis of phenotype-transportome correlation network identifies potential PGP mechanisms 
         There are two principle mechanisms by which  Pseudomonas  provides PGP effects to aspen seedlings that can be inferred from analysis of the correlations between  Pseudomonas  transportomic capacity and seedling phenotypes. Pseudomonads may: (i) increase the availability of nutrients to the seedlings; and/or (ii) influence root architecture through release of regulatory compounds. 
         
            Pseudomonas  increase nutrient acquisition to aspen seedlings 
           Organic acids (e.g., citrate, malate, and oxalate) exuded by roots mobilize mineral nutrients for uptake by plant roots (Jones and Darrah,  1994 ). These benefits are best expressed when exudates alter mineral solubility equilibria in the rhizosphere. The balance between organic acid transport and utilization by rhizobacteria may similarly contribute to nutrient dissolution and promote both root and shoot growth by increasing nutrient availability. In the current study, the transport systems of the  Pseudomonas  strains exporting organic acids and other siderophores are predicted to contribute PGP benefits. However, Pf0-1, which had the highest PRTT score for organic acid transport, did not confer a growth advantage to aspen seedlings relative to other strains, although tissue P concentrations were high (Table  1 ). In our experimental system, bacterial release of nutrients may not drive seedling response because the nutrients are all provided in inorganic soluble forms and are presumably available to the plant. The availability of other ions not measured in aspen, such as Fe 2/3+ , may be altered by siderophores released by  Pseudomonas  and may have benefited aspen growth (Tian et al.,  2009 ; Shen et al.,  2012 ). 
         
         
            Pseudomonas  influences aspen seedling root architecture 
           Pseudomonads had a significant effect on aspen root architecture (root branching, rootlets) and shoot biomass independent of media condition. The strongest effects on  Pseudomonas  root architecture were by SBW25 for root branching ( p -value 3.9 × 10 −3 ) and WH6 for rootlets ( p -value 2.4 × 10 −11 ), and these effects may have contributed to the shoot biomass gains in both SBW25 ( p -value 3.0 × 10 −4 ) and WH6 ( p -value 3.1 × 10 −3 ; Table  1 ). Changes in root architecture may have two consequences to PGP: increasing root branching and rootlets promotes nutrient uptake by increasing the root surface area for absorption and may also provide a more favorable environment for  Pseudomonas  growth. 
           Molecules with potential transporters in the  Pseudomonas  transportomes that have been shown to influence root morphology include several of the sugars (Baskin et al.,  2001 ; Stevenson and Harrington,  2009 ), polyamines (Couee et al.,  2004 ), and glutamate (Walch-Liu and Forde,  2007 ). These molecules and related compounds could be produced and released by  Pseudomonas  or alternatively produced by the plant and taken up and utilized by  Pseudomonas . Both of these processes may take place simultaneously into the rhizosphere of aspen and play roles in increasing root growth and surface area.  Pseudomonas  may take up and utilize a variety of photosynthetically-derived sugars commonly found in the root exudates (e.g., glucose, xylose, galactose, and fructose; Walker et al.,  2003 ; Carvalhais et al.,  2013 ) enhancing its ability to grow and survive in the rhizosphere.  Pseudomonas  may additionally produce auxin (Larsen et al.,  2015 ) or alter auxin levels/signaling pathways in the host root (Walch-Liu and Forde,  2007 ), which would alter patterns of lateral root development (Salazar-Henao et al.,  2016 ). From analysis of interaction network (Figure  5 ), root biomass is also predicted to be influenced by the transport of the possible regulatory compounds tryptophan, phenylalanine, nicotinamide, and lipopolysaccharides by  Pseudomonas . Tryptophan is a known plant growth promoter that interacts with root-associated bacteria (Hassan and Bano,  2015 ). Tryptophan is also a precursor to auxin biosynthesis (Zhao,  2012 ) and may mediate root architecture change through this pathway. Phenylalanine induces secondary metabolism in plants (Basha et al.,  2006 ; Koca and Karaman,  2015 ). Nicotinamide is a plant stress-associated compound that can induce and regulate secondary metabolic accumulation and induce plant defense responses (Takeuchi et al.,  1975 ; Mohamed et al.,  1989 ; Hashida et al.,  2007 ). Interestingly, several of the sugars for which there are transporters in  Pseudomonas  have complex effects on anthocyanin accumulation in  Arabidopsis  when supplemented in the media (Stevenson and Harrington,  2009 ). In our study the observed increase of anthocyanin concentrations in replete media (presumed non-stressed) aspen seedling co-cultured with  Pseudomonas  may reflect the plant response to the differential metabolism of some of these sugars by  Pseudomonas . 
           In our vertical plate system, increased root growth and surface area should increase aspen seedlings access to nutrients. In the media, both       NO   3  −      and H 2       PO   4  −      are soluble and limitations to their diffusion in agar are expected to be small. Nonetheless, while phenotypes such as tissue concentrations of       NO   3  −      and P did not reflect beneficial effect of  Pseudomonas  (Table  1 ), total P accumulation in aspen seedlings co-cultured with  Pseudomonas  increased by 1.7- to 3.9-fold and final seedling biomass was correlated to rootlet formation. It thus appears that one of the PGP effects of  Pseudomonas  is enhanced nutrient acquisition related to altered root architecture, as reported previously (Frey-Klett et al.,  2011 ). 
         
         
            Pseudomonas  enhances colonization of the rhizosphere 
           Some compounds transported by  Pseudomonas  may directly stimulate or repress the defense response of aspen seedling roots. Markers of pathogenicity (octopone, nopaline, glucosamine, and rhamnose) are all negatively correlated with shoot length in low P conditions (Figure  5 ). Rhamnose (Santhanam et al.,  2016 ) and nopaline and octopine (Lippincott and Lippincott,  1970 ) are pathogenicity-related markers associated with root crown galls. Glucosamine is a component of chitin that may induce plant defense responses (Nurnberger and Brunner,  2002 ) and glucosame is also a nitrogenous compound known to be rapidly taken up by plant root (Roberts,  1970 ). Proline, predicted to influence shoot biomass, has been observed to induce stress tolerance in basil (Rady et al.,  2016 ). 
           Other compounds that may be transported by systems coded in the  Pseudomonas  transportome may mediate positive interactions and/or facilitate colonization between bacteria and roots. Transport of lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, and fucose are all correlated with seedling biomass (Figure  5 ). Lipoproteins are essential to forming biofilms and colonizing plant roots (Campisano et al.,  2006 ; Ghafoor et al.,  2011 ) and lipopolysaccharides are known mediators between plant roots and soil bacteria (Duijff et al.,  1997 ; Reitz et al.,  2000 ; Fedonenko et al.,  2001 ). Lipopeptides are regulatory compounds in  Pseudomonas -root interactions that influence antimicrobial activity, motility, and biofilm formation (Song et al.,  2014 ). Fucose is a component of plant root mucilage (Roy et al.,  2002 ) and is known to promote interactions with rhizosphere community (Northcote and Gould,  1989 ). 
         
       
       
         Conclusions and future studies 
         We sought to uncover potential molecular mechanisms underlying rhizobacterial plant growth promotion effects under conditions of limited N and P using a laboratory model of aspen seedlings and four strains of  Pseudomonas , Pf-5, Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6. We demonstrated that our nutrient limited conditions produced measurable stress responses in aspen seedlings and that those responses were alleviated by  Pseudomonas  in a strain and media-specific fashion. We propose that the alleviation of nutrient stress by  Pseudomonas  is due to three classes of ability functions: to mobilize nutrients, to direct aspen seedling root structure, and to successfully colonize the rhizosphere. These mechanisms are potentially linked to the transport of specific ligands, which can be traced back to specific genes and proteins for transporters and sensors in  Pseudomonas . These results will lead directly to future specific, hypothesis-driven biological experiments to validate predicted PGP transportomic mechanisms.

         The marine mixotrophic ciliate  Mesodinium rubrum  is known to acquire chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleomorphs, and nucleus from its cryptophyte prey, particularly from species in the genera,  Geminigera  and  Teleaulax . The sequestered prey nucleus and chloroplasts are considered to support photosynthesis of  M. rubrum . In addition, recent studies have shown enlargement of the retained prey nucleus in starved  M. rubrum  and have inferred that enlargement results from the fusion of ingested prey nuclei. Thus far, however, little is known about the mechanism underlying the enlargement of the prey nucleus in  M. rubrum . Here, we conducted starvation and refeeding studies to monitor the fate of prey nuclei acquired by  M. rubrum  when feeding on  Teleaulax amphioxeia  and to explore the influence of the retained prey nucleus on photosynthesis of  M. rubrum . Results indicate that enlargement of the prey nucleus does not result from fusion of nuclei. Furthermore, the enlarged prey nucleus does not appear to divide during cell division of  M. rubrum . The presence of a prey nucleus significantly affected photosynthetic performance of  M. rubrum , while the number of retained chloroplasts had little influence on rate of carbon fixation. We interpret results within the context of a model that considers the dynamics of ingested prey nuclei during division of  M. rubrum .

       Introduction 
        Mesodinium rubrum  (= Myrionecta rubra ) is a common ciliate in coastal waters worldwide, where it sometimes causes red tides ( Taylor et al., 1971 ;  Lindholm, 1985 ). It is an obligate mixotroph, requiring both light and prey uptake for sustained growth and survival ( Gustafson et al., 2000 ;  Yih et al., 2004 ;  Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ). Growth of  M. rubrum  is to a large extent phototrophic and closely linked to irradiance ( Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Johnson et al., 2006 ;  Smith and Hansen, 2007 ;  Moeller et al., 2011 ). Under culture conditions,  M. rubrum  feeds specifically on cryptophytes belonging to the genera  Geminigera  and  Teleaulax  ( Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ;  Park et al., 2007 ;  Myung et al., 2011 ;  Hansen et al., 2012 ;  Raho et al., 2014 ). 
       It has long been known that  Mesodinium rubrum  contains chloroplasts of cryptophyte origin ( Taylor et al., 1971 ;  Hibberd, 1977 ). Recent studies have shown that these chloroplasts are genetically similar to the prey on which  M. rubrum  is fed, indicating that chloroplasts are sequestered from the prey ( Johnson et al., 2006 ,  2007 ;  Hansen et al., 2012 ;  Myung et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, cross-feeding experiments in which prey were switched from one species to another led to the replacement of chloroplasts in  M. rubrum , depending upon the available prey species ( Hansen et al., 2012 ;  Raho et al., 2014 ). In starved  M. rubrum , sequestered prey chloroplasts have been shown to divide along with cell divisions of the ciliate ( Johnson et al., 2006 ;  Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless,  M. rubrum  requires continuous acquisition of new chloroplasts and other cell organelles acquired through feeding for sustained growth. 
       Early works found that  M. rubrum  contains a single enlarged nucleus of cryptophyte origin, along with cryptophyte chloroplasts, other cell organelles, and cytoplasm ( Taylor et al., 1969 ,  1971 ;  Hibberd, 1977 ;  Oakley and Taylor, 1978 ). This condition was believed to represent an incomplete endosymbiont, and the enlarged cryptophyte nucleus was referred to as a ‘symbiont nucleus’ ( Hibberd, 1977 ;  Oakley and Taylor, 1978 ). Later, however, it was verified that the symbiont nucleus, like the cryptophyte chloroplasts, is acquired by  M. rubrum  after feeding on prey ( Gustafson et al., 2000 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Johnson, 2011 ;  Hansen et al., 2012 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ) and was termed ‘kleptokaryon’ by  Johnson et al. (2007) . For simplicity, the ‘enlarged acquired prey nucleus’ will be called the ‘symbiont nucleus’ in the remainder of the introduction. 
       The single symbiont nucleus observed in well-fed  M. rubrum  cultures ( Johnson et al., 2007 ) is eventually lost following cell divisions of the ciliate subjected to prolonged starvation ( Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ). However, the symbiont nucleus was still observed in all cells after the first cell division in prey starved experiments, indicating that the acquired prey nucleus divide at least one time inside  M. rubrum  ( Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ).  Gustafson et al. (2000) , as well as recent papers by  Kim et al. (2016)  and  Nam et al. (2016)  showed that well-fed  M. rubrum  retained additional prey nuclei which were smaller than the symbiont nucleus and of size similar to the nucleus of the prey species. Also, it has been observed that smaller prey nuclei become enlarged over time during prey starvation in  M. rubrum  ( Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ;  Nam et al., 2016 ). The interpretation made by the authors of these recent studies was that acquired prey nuclei fused to make the symbiont nucleus. However, this interpretation was not experimentally tested and the exact mechanism underlying enlargement of the acquired cryptophyte nuclei in  M. rubrum  remains unknown. 
       In the present study, the fate of prey nuclei sequestered by  M. rubrum  was monitored during prey starvation and refeeding experiments using confocal microscopy. Changes in size and position of prey nuclei inside the ciliate were determined, and evidence of nuclear division or fusion was noted. Furthermore, the relationship between the presence of a retained prey nucleus and the photosynthetic efficiency and growth of  M. rubrum  was studied. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Cultures 
         Cultures of  Mesodinium rubrum  (MBL-DK2009) and  Teleaulax amphioxeia  (SCCAP K-0434; SCCAP) were established using single cells isolated from Helsingør harbor, Denmark, in 2009. Both species were grown in f/2 medium based on autoclaved seawater ( Guillard, 1975 ) with a salinity of 30 and maintained in 24-well tissue culture plates (TPP, Switzerland). Both species were grown at 15°C ± 1.0 in a temperature regulated room, under a photon irradiance of 100 μmol photons m -2  s -1  (PAR, 400–700 nm), and on a light:dark cycle of 14:10. Light was provided by cool white fluorescent tubes (OSRAM, 58W, 840). Irradiance was measured (in seawater) at the level of incubation flasks using a light meter equipped with a spherical quantum sensor (ULM and US-SQS/L, Walz GmbH, Germany).  T. amphioxeia  was supplied as prey at a predator:prey ratio of approximately 10:1 when  M. rubrum  was transferred weekly to new medium. 
       
       
         Experiment 1: Starvation of Well-Fed  Mesodinium rubrum  
         The first experiment was designed to monitor the change in photosynthetic performance and the number, size and position of prey nuclei during starvation of  M. rubrum. M. rubrum  cells were kept well-fed for 2 weeks by adding sufficient prey every 3 days to a culture grown in a 750-ml tissue culture flask (TPP, Switzerland). After 2 weeks of frequent feeding, the  M. rubrum  culture was allowed to deplete the prey, and absence of prey in the culture was confirmed under an inverted microscope at x40 magnification (Olympus CK2, Japan). A portion of the well-fed, but prey-free,  M. rubrum  and stock culture of  T. amphioxeia  were then added to a 750 ml tissue culture flask to achieve an initial predator:prey ratio to 1:5 and a  M. rubrum  cell concentration of ∼200 ml -1 . From this stock culture, a 150-ml aliquot was transferred to each of three 270-ml tissue culture flasks. The flasks were placed on a shelf with light coming from the side at an irradiance of 60 μmol photons m -2 s -1 . Position of the flasks was changed sequentially once a day to minimize difference in light exposure between the flasks. Subsamples for cell enumeration and assessment of photosynthetic performance were withdrawn from each flask on 13 occasions during the experiment: on Day 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 26, and 29 ( Figure  1  ). For confocal microscopy, a single Day 0 sample was taken prior to distributing stock culture to replicate flasks, with samples taken from replicate flasks on all other days. pH was monitored at each sampling occasion directly in the flasks with a SenTix ® 41 pH electrode (WTW, Germany) connected to a pH meter (WTW, pH 3210, Germany), and calibrated with pH 7 and pH 10 standard buffers (WTW, Technischer, NIST, buffers). To avoid physiological effects of elevated pH in laboratory cultures ( Hansen, 2002 ), half the volume of each experimental cultures of  M. rubrum  was removed and replaced with fresh f/2 medium on Day 8, 11, 14, and 20, when pH values were approaching to 8.5.

              Schematic illustration of experimental design used for starvation and refeeding experiments, respectively.  The two experiments were conducted over 7 weeks. Experiment 1, starvation of well-fed  Mesodinium rubrum , was carried out for 4 weeks, with the starved cells at the end of that experiment immediately use in Experiment 2, refeeding of starved  M. rubrum . 
           
           
         
         
           Cell Abundance and Growth Rate 
           Aliquots (2.3 ml) withdrawn from each flask were fixed with acid Lugol’s solution (final concentration 1%). Abundance of  M. rubrum  and  T. amphioxeia  was enumerated using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber under the inverted microscope (Olympus CK40) at 100X and 200X. At least 400 cells were enumerated. Growth rates were calculated during the exponential portion of the growth phase using the following exponential growth equation:

           Measurement of Photosynthetic Activity ( 14 C) 
           Two 2-ml aliquots were withdrawn from each flask, transferred to each of two 20-ml glass scintillation vials, and used for measurements of photosynthesis. Twenty microliter of NaH 14  CO 3  stock solution (specific activity = 100 μCi ml -1 ; Carbon-14 Centralen, Denmark) was added to each vial. One vial of each pair was incubated for 3 h in the same place as the experimental flask, and the other vial was kept in complete darkness by wrapping in aluminum foil. After incubation, a 100 μl sub-sample was withdrawn from each vial and added to a new vial containing 200 μl phenylethylamine for measurements of specific activity ( Skovgaard et al., 2000 ). The remaining 1.9 ml were acidified with 2 ml 10% glacial acetic acid in methanol, and evaporated overnight at 60°C to remove all inorganic carbon. The residue in the vial was re-dissolved in 2 ml Milli-Q water before adding 10 ml of scintillation cocktail (Insta-Gel Plus, Packard, USA). All vials were vigorously shaken and then analyzed using a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2910 TR, Perkin-Elmer). Photosynthetic activity (PA, pg C cell -1  h -1 ) was calculated as follows:

DIC concentrations were measured within a few hours using a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-L, Shimadzu, Japan). 
         
         
           Confocal Microscopy 
           Location, number, and changes in size of prey nuclei inside  M. rubrum  were studied by confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained using the fluorescent nuclear stain Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, USA) and plasma membrane stain using CellMask Green (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Subsamples (5–10 ml) taken from each flask were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde (EMD Millipore, USA) at 4°C for 1 h. Fixed samples were stained with a combination of 25 μg ml -1  Hoechst 33258 and 0.25 X CellMask for 15 min in a dark chamber, then filtered through a 0.2 μm black polycarbonate membrane filter (Frisenette, Denmark), and finally washed with fresh autoclaved seawater to remove excess dye. A drop of immersion oil placed on both sides of a membrane filter was used to attach the filter to the microscope slide and coverglass. Nuclear size was measured directly from images taken at 600X magnification using a FViewII digital camera (Olympus Soft Imaging System, Tokyo, Japan) linked to the inverted microscope (Olympus IX81, Japan) equipped with a disk-spinning unit (DSU, Olympus, Japan). Epifluorescence micrographs of stained  M. rubrum  cells were taken at 1,000X magnification using a digital camera coupled to the Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with differential interference contrast. Twenty cells were examined for each sample. 3D images were generated using IMARIS software program (Bitplane, Zürich, Switzerland) to assess the number and volume of chloroplasts of  M. rubrum . 
         
       
       
         Experiment 2: Refeeding of Starved  Mesodinium rubrum  
         The second experiment was designed to monitor the changes in the number, size and position of prey nuclei upon refeeding and subsequent prey starvation. After taking subsamples on Day 29, the three cultures from the first experiment were poured together in a 750-ml tissue culture flask and then distributed to three 750-ml tissue flasks.  T. amphioxeia  and new f/2 medium was added to each of the three flasks to give predator:prey ratios of 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10 and then a 150-ml subsample of each flask was transferred to each of three 270-ml tissue culture flasks. The triplicate flasks for each treatment were maintained as in Experiment 1, with subsamples for estimating cell abundance (2.3 ml) withdrawn on 10 occasions during the experiment (Day 0, 0.5, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 19) ( Figure  1  ). Samples for measuring the size of prey nuclei inside of  M. rubrum  (5–10 ml) were taken on Day 0.5 to Day 19, with Day 29 data from Experiment 1 used as Day 0 data for Experiment 2. All nine flasks were supplied with fresh f/2 medium after removal of half of the ‘old’ medium on Day 10 for the same reason as above. 
       
       
         Statistical Analyses 
         Relationships of photosynthesis with prevalence of the centered prey nucleus (CPN; see below) and number of chloroplasts were analyzed and plotted using non-linear regression analysis (Sigma Plot v. 10.0). Data reported in the text as means are given ± standard error of the mean (SE). Error bars provided in figures also represent SE.

         Experiment 1: Starvation of Well-Fed  Mesodinium rubrum  
         
           Nuclei of Prey and Well-Fed  Mesodinium rubrum  
           Well-fed  Mesodinium rubrum  cells (Day 0 to Day 11) contain two ciliate macronuclei and one ciliate micronucleus, all of which were closely positioned at the center of the cell ( Figure  2B  ). The two macronuclei (diameter 3.54 μm ± 0.07 μm;  Table  1  ) were placed close to each other in the middle of the cell, while the micronucleus (diameter 2.63 μm ± 0.09 μm) was located just posterior to the two macronuclei. Well-fed cells of  M. rubrum  contained additional nuclei of cryptophyte origin. A solitary cryptophyte nucleus (diameter 4.35 μm ± 0.04 μm;  Table  1  ) was located in the center of the cell in close association with the ciliate nuclei and always anterior to the two ciliate macronuclei ( Figure  2C  ). This arrangement is subsequently referred to as the cryptophyte-ciliate nuclear complex (CCN complex;  Figure  2D  ). We also observed smaller cryptophyte nuclei (diameter 2.53 μm ± 0.04 μm), typically located at the periphery of the ciliate and usually in the anterior part of the cell ( Figure  2C  ). These nuclei were similar in size to the nucleus (diameter 2.08 μm ± 0.04 μm,  Table  1  ) of the prey,  Teleaulax amphioxeia , ( Figures  2A,C  ). We will subsequently refer to the former and latter type of ingested prey nuclei as “CPN” and “extra prey nucleus” (EPN), respectively ( Figure  2C  ).

           After staining with a combination of Hoechst 3325 and CellMask Green, the ciliate micronucleus always emitted stronger fluorescence than the two macronuclei ( Figures  2B,C  ). EPNs were typically spherical ( Figure  2C  ), while CPNs varied from spherical to irregular in shape ( Figure  2C  ). EPNs were never clustered close together, and none of 181 EPNs examined during the experiment showed evidence of fusing with another EPN or a CPN. Dividing  M. rubrum  cells were common in stained preparations, but none of 388 CPNs examined for the experiment appeared to be undergoing nuclear division. The location, size, and shape of CPNs present in dividing  M. rubrum  cells ( Figure  9  ) were indistinguishable from that of CPNs occurring in non-dividing cells. 
         
         
           Cell Divisions 
           The culture of  Mesodinium rubrum  that was mixed with  Teleaulax amphioxeia  at an initial ratio of 1:5 had almost depleted the cryptophyte prey at Day 8, and the prey were depleted below detection limit (&lt;1 cell ml -1 ) by Day 11 ( Figure  3A  ). During the first 8 days of the incubation,  M. rubrum  divided every second day (μ = 0.37 ± 0.01 d -1 ). After that period, growth declined. From Day 8 to Day 14,  M. rubrum  divided every third day (μ = 0.25 ± 0.02 d -1 ), and from Day 14 to end of the experiment cells stopped dividing (μ = 0.10 ± 0.02 d -1 ). A total of eight cell divisions were observed, four of which occurred in the period without available prey.

           Number and Volume of Chloroplasts 
           Even though  M. rubrum  divided several times during the experiment, the number of chloroplasts cell -1  remained relatively constant at 20 ± 0.39 cell -1  ( n  = 12) for 26 days, despite the fact that prey cells were depleted after Day 8 ( Figure  3B  ). After Day 26, the number of chloroplasts decreased rapidly to reach 14 ± 0.10 cell -1  at the end of the experiment. Chloroplast volume cell -1  remained more or less steady from Day 0 to Day 18 (444 ± 33 μm 3  cell -1 ;  n  = 9), thereafter gradually decreasing to a mean of 274 ± 8 μm 3  cell -1  on the last day of the experiment. 
         
         
           Changes in Prevalence and Linear Dimensions of Sequestered Prey Nuclei Inside  M. rubrum  Cells 
           More than 90% of the well-fed  M. rubrum  cells possessed a CPN at the initiation of the experiment ( Figure  3C  ) and a similar percentage was observed for the following 6 days (92.4 ± 0.2%;  n  = 4). The proportion of ciliates having a CPN decreased to ∼70% from Day 8 to 11 as prey cells were depleted, in which time  M. rubrum  underwent two additional cell divisions. Subsequently, the proportion of cells with a CPN gradually declined to ∼13.3% on Day 29. 
           Centered prey nucleus diameter was relatively stable over the first 11 days of the experiment ( Figure  3C  ), showing a minimum value of 4.01 ± 0.15 μm ( n  = 3) for samples taken on Day 4 and a maximum of 4.73 ± 0.14 μm on Day 11 ( n  = 3). During starvation (Day 11–29), however, the size of the CPN gradually increased to 6.8 ± 0.1 μm ( n  = 3) for samples taken on Day 26 ( Figure  3C  ), in direct contrast to the change in prevalence of cells with a CPN. The largest CPN observed during the experiment was encountered in samples taken at Day 26 and measured 8.9 μm in diameter. 
           Extra prey nucleus were only observed in  M. rubrum  cells when prey cells were present (Day 0–8;  Figure  3D  ). The percentage of ciliates with EPN was ∼75% at Day 2 and 4, and on average a little more than 1 EPN was found per cell (1.24 ± 0.05,  n  = 2, the number relative to all observed cells). Both values dropped rapidly after Day 4. 
         
         
           Inorganic Carbon Uptake 
            Mesodinium rubrum  maintained an inorganic carbon uptake of 45.2 ± 2.5 pg C cell -1  h -1  ( n  = 6) until Day 11 ( Figure  3C  ). Subsequently, photosynthetic activity steadily decreased in conjunction with prey depletion, reaching a value of 16 ± 1.4 pg C cell -1  h -1  at Day 29. Over the course of the experiment, inorganic carbon uptake displayed a direct relationship to the prevalence of cells with a CPN ( r  2  = 0.955,  p  &lt; 0.0001;  Figure  4  ). No relationship was observed between inorganic carbon uptake and the number of chloroplasts per cell ( r  2  = 0.0,  p  = 1;  Figure  4  ).

           Cell Divisions 
           Predator:prey ratio calculated from mean concentration of the predator during the first 48 h of incubation and initial prey density, was 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10 for the different treatments. On Day 10, prey concentrations were less than 1% of initial concentration in all treatments. On Day 13, the prey were depleted below detection limit (&lt;1 cell ml -1 ) in the 1:2.5 and 1:5 treatments, and on Day 16 in the 1:10 treatment ( Figures  5A–C  ).  M. rubrum  abundance increased rapidly 4 days after refeeding with prey, showing a doubling in cell concentration every second day until Day 10. All cultures were diluted with fresh f/2 medium to a new initial concentration of 500 cells ml -1  on Day 10, resulting in two additional cell divisions every third day, after which growth stopped.

           Changes in Prevalence of Ingested Prey Nuclei in  M. rubrum  at Different Prey Concentrations 
           Immediately after the addition of prey, EPNs were observed in  M. rubrum  cells in all treatments. Likewise, when prey was depleted, EPNs were no longer observed ( Figures  5D–F  ). Changes in the prevalence and number of EPNs were directly related to prey concentration. The highest percentage of cells having EPNs was observed on Day 4 or Day 6 in the three treatments. At low prey concentration (predator to prey ratio of 1:2.5), 66.6% of  M. rubrum  cells had a mean of 1.12 ± 0.38 ( n  = 3) EPNs cell -1  on Day 6 ( Figure  5D  ). At moderate prey concentration (predator to prey ratio of 1:5), about 88.3% of  M. rubrum  cells had a mean of 2.18 ± 0.19 ( n  = 3) EPNs cell -1  on Day 4 ( Figure  5E  ), while at the high initial prey concentration (predator to prey ratio of 1:10), 100% of  M. rubrum  cells retained a mean of 5 ± 0.16 ( n  = 3) EPNs cell -1  on Day 6 ( Figure  5F  ). The largest number of EPNs retained by a single  M. rubrum  cell (11) was observed on Day 1 in the high prey treatment. The ‘n’ refers to triplicate samples and EPNs were scored in at least 20 cells in each sample. 
           At the start of the experiment, less than 10% of  M. rubrum  cells had a CPN, but the prevalence of cells with a CPN increased after refeeding, exceeding 80% on Day 4 in all treatments ( Figures  5D–F  ). Changes in the occurrence of cells with a CPN, however, showed different patterns across the treatments of prey concentration. At the lowest prey density, the prevalence of a CPN declined after Day 6, as cells underwent division ( Figure  5D  ), while at moderate prey density, prevalence of a CPN remained above 90% from Day 4 to 10 as cells divided 4 times and then decreased ( Figure  5E  ). At the high prey concentration, prevalence of a CPN was maintained above 80% while cells divided five times (Day 4 to Day 13) and then decreased ( Figure  5F  ). Changes in the prevalence of CPNs relative to the number of cell divisions were dependent on initial prey density. The percent cells with CPNs declined after three cell divisions in the low prey treatment after 4 cell divisions in the medium prey treatment, and after five cell divisions in the high prey treatment ( Figure  6  ).

           Extra prey nucleus abundance (i.e., number ml -1 ) increased to a peak on Day 6 in the low prey treatment and on Day 8 in the medium and high prey treatments, before declining to undetectable levels as prey was depleted ( Figure  7  ). Abundance of total ingested prey nuclei (EPNs + CPNs) increased to a peak on Day 10 in all three treatments, but remained relatively stable following dilution of the cultures and depletion of prey. After dilution of the high prey treatment on Day 10, EPN abundance was about half that of total ingested nuclei ( Figure  7C  ). Over the following 6 days, EPN abundance in that treatment dropped to zero without influencing abundance of total ingested nuclei.

           Changes in Size of Sequestered Prey Nuclei in  M. rubrum  at Different Prey Concentrations 
           Extra prey nucleus observed in all three treatments were relatively constant in size ( Figure  8A  ), with a mean diameter of 2.17 ± 0.01 μm for measurements pooled across treatment and time ( Table  1  ). By contrast, CPNs were initially large in size ( Figure  8B  ), having a mean diameter of 6.83 ± 0.26 μm on Day 0 ( Table  1  ). Treatment means showed decreased CPN size from Day 0.5 to Day 4 as prey were ingested and new CPNs formed, with CPN diameter for data pooled across treatments for those days averaging 3.08 ± 0.07 μm. Like in Experiment 1, the size of CPNs increased over time after prey were depleted ( Figures  8B  ,   9  ), with data pooled across treatments for Day 19 averaging 5.75 ± 0.12 μm. CPN size at the end of the experiment was similar across treatment, but pronounced enlargement occurred sooner (Day 6–8) in the lowest prey treatment compared to in the medium and high prey treatments (Day 10–13).

(1)  M. rubrum  feeds on three cryptophyte  Teleaulax amphioxeia  cells as prey, and obtains the nuclei of each prey (EPN). One of the EPN moves toward the center of the ciliate (or anterior to the three ciliate nuclei) and becomes enlarged (CPN). The other two EPN transfer to daughter cells through cell division, respectively. After first cell division, one daughter cell (2.1) has a CPN derived from one of the EPN. This daughter cell is divided into new daughter cells having a CPN (3.1) or not (3.2) by a second cell division. Meanwhile, the other daughter cell (2.2) has a CPN with one EPN. In case of this daughter cell, it is divided into new daughter cells through a second cell division; two daughter cells (3.3 and 3.4) have a CPN, respectively. Each CPN moves in the same way as before following a third cell division. As a result, only three cells among the eight daughter cells have a CPN after the third cell division. The series of epifluorescence images show temporal differences in the arrangement, number, and size of ingested prey nuclei after feeding starved  M. rubrum  with  T. amphioxeia.

           Frequency distributions for CPN diameter showed distinct size classes of ‘old’ and ‘new’ CPNs on Day 0 to Day 4.  M. rubrum  on Day 0 were derived from pooled culture remaining on Day 29 of Experiment 1 and thus contained ‘old’ CPNs that fell into the 5.5–6.4 μm to 7.5–8.4 μm size classes ( Supplementary Figure  S1  ). On Day 3.5, smaller, presumably ‘new’ CPNs were observed, 94% of which fell into the 1.5–2.4 μm and 2.5–3.4 μm size classes and had a mean diameter of 2.58 ± 0.06 μm ( n  = 29). Given the mean diameter of EPNs on Day 0.5 (2.06 μm,  Table  1  ), the volume of ‘new’ CPNs (8.9 μm 3 ) was about twice that of EPNs (4.5 μm 3 ) present in  M. rubrum  at the same time. Over the following 3.5 days, the frequency distribution for ‘new’ CPNs shifted toward larger size classes, with the peak occurring in the 2.5–3.4 μm size class on Day 1 and in the 3.5–4.4 μm size class on Day 4. 
           A total of 1959 ENPs were examined for the experiment, none of which appeared to be in the process of fusing with another EPN or a CPN. While dividing  M. rubrum  were common in Experiment 2, none of the 335 CPNs examined for Day 0.5 to Day 19 appeared to be undergoing division. 
         
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       
         Presence of Extra Prey Nuclei (ENPs) and the Centered Prey Nucleus 
         The ciliate  Mesodinium rubrum  has for long been known to harbor prey cytoplasm and cell organelles, including chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nuclei through feeding on cryptophytes ( Taylor et al., 1969 ,  1971 ;  Hibberd, 1977 ;  Oakley and Taylor, 1978 ). Initially, it was believed that this represented a reduced permanent “symbiont,” but recent molecular studies have indicated that this is not true. There is now clear evidence that the cryptophyte organelles and cytoplasm are identical to the prey that the ciliate is fed (e.g.,  Johnson et al., 2007 ) and that the chloroplasts from one cryptophyte species can be exchanged with chloroplasts from another species ( Hansen et al., 2012 ). Previous publications have used transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy to document the presence of small (1.9–4 μm in diameter) or large (4.5–10 μm in diameter) prey nuclei ( Hibberd, 1977 ;  Oakley and Taylor, 1978 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ;  Nam et al., 2016 ). Those reports are limited to observations of only one type of prey nucleus inside individual  M. rubrum  cells and provide little information about how  M. rubrum  retains different sizes of prey nuclei.  Kim et al. (2016) , however, suggested that small prey nuclei fuse to form a large prey nucleus. Similarly,  Nam et al. (2016)  reported that small nuclei sequestered from prey were enclosed in a single membrane and suggested that small nuclei moved to the center of the  M. rubrum  cell and fused to form a single large prey nucleus. 
         Our study documents that along with two ciliate macronuclei and one ciliate micronucleus, well-fed  M. rubrum  cells can simultaneously have multiple small, peripherally positioned prey nuclei that we call extra prey nuclei (EPNs), and a single large, centrally positioned prey nucleus (CPN). EPNs were slightly larger (mean diameter 2.53 μm) than the mean size of the prey,  Teleaulax amphioxeia , nucleus (mean diameter 2.08 μm). The CPN was always located at the center of the cell, as also shown for the large prey nucleus reported in previous studies ( Hibberd, 1977 ;  Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ;  Nam et al., 2016 ), and was generally much larger than the EPNs. The CPN, however, showed considerable variation in size during our experiments, depending on prey concentration and incubation time. The CPN size was relatively stable in well-fed  M. rubrum  supplied with plentiful prey (mean diameter 4.35 μm) but increased dramatically during starvation, averaging 6.8 μm in diameter 18 days after depletion of prey. 
         
           Formation and Enlargement of the CPN 
           Eighteen days after depletion of prey, ∼85% of the  M. rubru m in our study lacked a CPN and none possessed EPNs, but both types of nuclei were reacquired by a majority of the cells upon refeeding. EPNs appeared in most cells within 12 h and increased in number over time, with maximum mean number cell -1  ranging from one to five depending on the amount of prey provided. Up to 11 EPNs were observed in individual  M. rubrum . EPNs occupied a peripheral position in the cell, whereas recently sequestered ‘new’ CPNs were located at the center of the cell had a mean diameter (2.58 μm), similar to that of recently acquired EPNs (2.06 μm) present in cells at the same time. Four days post feeding, 80 – 90%, depending on prey concentration, of  M. rubrum  cells had a CPN, with mean diameter of 3.80 μm, larger than an EPN, but smaller than the CPN of well-fed cells (mean 4.35 μm). Calculations based on mean diameter indicate that the volume of ‘new’ CPNs is about twice that of recently acquired EPNs, raising the possibility that ‘new’ CPNs arise from fusion of two EPNs. However, fusing of multiple EPNs to form a ‘new’ CPN seems unlikely, since none of the more than 2100 EPNs observed in our experiments were closely clustered or appeared to be fusing with another EPN. It seems more probable that ‘new’ CPNs form by the relocation of a single EPN to the center of the cells accompanied by and/or followed by an increase in size that does not result from fusion with another EPN. 
           One may wonder how the CPN of  M. rubrum  increases in size over time. As mentioned in the introduction, enlargement of the centrally positioned prey nucleus was reported by  Johnson et al. (2007) ,  Kim et al. (2016) , and  Nam et al. (2016)  and suggested in the latter two papers to result from the fusion of smaller ingested prey nuclei. Data from our starvation/refeeding study (Experiment 2), however, do not support that hypothesis, for several reasons. First, of the more than 2100 EPNs and over 600 CPNs examined during our experiments, fusions of an EPN with a CPN was never observed. If enlargement of the ‘new’ CPN were to be a slow process, fusion events might occur infrequently and thus not be observed in our samples. Enlargement of ‘new’ CPNs in our starvation/refeeding study, however, appeared to be a rather rapid process, as indicated by the observed upward shift in size classes of ‘new’ CPNs from Day 0.5 to Day 1 and Day 4. Second, during both of our experiments, CPNs showed a dramatic increase after prey had been depleted and continued to enlarge even after the number of EPNs cell -1  had dropped to undetectable levels. Enlargement of CPNs when prey cells were not available to be ingested and when EPNs were not present in  M. rubrum  cells, indicates that CPNs can enlarge without fusion with EPNs. Third, once prey were reduced to very low or undetectable levels, the number of total ingested prey nuclei (EPNs + CPNs) ml -1  remained stable as the number of EPNs ml -1  decreased. Were the disappearance of EPNs to result from fusion with CPNs, then the total number of ingested prey nuclei ml -1  would be expected to decrease. Fourth, if enlargement of CPNs were to result from fusion with EPNs, then it would be reasonable to expect the size of the CPNs and the rate of CPN enlargement to depend on the number of EPNs that are retained. In our starvation/refeeding study, however, the size CPNs was similar in all treatments even though the maximum mean number of EPNs cell -1  showed a fivefold difference. In addition, enlargement of CPNs progressed faster in our lowest prey treatment where maximum mean number of EPNs cell -1  was one, than in our moderate and high prey treatment where maximum mean number of EPNs cell -1  was two and five, respectively ( Figure  8B  ). 
           Our results support the alternative hypothesis that CPNs are formed by the relocation of a single EPN from the periphery to the center of the  M. rubrum  cell where it becomes part of the ciliate-cryptophyte nuclear complex and increases in size without fusing with EPNs. Under that scenario, EPNs remaining at the periphery of cells after formation of a ‘new’ CPN might be digested, or might be distributed to daughter cells during division of  M. rubrum  where they would be available to form a ‘new’ CPN. The latter possibility assumes that CPNs do not divide along with the ciliate, as our data suggest (see below). If EPNs are distributed to daughter cells to form ‘new’ CPN, then the mean number of EPNs cell -1  would influence the number of cell divisions that could occur without a decline in the frequency of  M. rubrum  with a CPN. That seems to be the case in our starvation/refeeding experiment, as  M. rubrum  in the low, medium, and high prey treatments had a maximum mean number EPNs cell -1  of 1, 2, and 5 divided 3, 4, and 5 times, respectively, before showing a drop in CPN frequency. 
         
         
           Lack of Division and Disappearance of the CPN 
           Our results imply that the CPN of  M. rubrum  does not divide. Not only did we fail to observe indications of division in any of the more than 600 CPNs examined, CPNs of dividing  M. rubrum  were indistinguishable from the CPNs of non-dividing cells. Also, CPN prevalence decreased with division of host cells as prey were depleted, suggesting dilution of CPN cell -1  due to lack of CPN division. As mentioned above, the total number of ingested prey nuclei (EPNs + CPNs) ml -1  as prey were depleted remained relatively constant, due to apparent transformation of EPNs into CPNs. Were CPNs to have divided during that time, total ingested prey nuclei ml -1  should have increased. Hence, during cell division of  M. rubrum , the CPN appears to be inherited by only one of the two daughter cells. The lack of the ability of  M. rubrum  to divide the CPN has previously been reported by  Johnson et al. (2007) . During prey starvation they found a disappearance of the CPN (termed kleptokaryon in their study) in  M. rubrum  over time and could estimate a half time of its disappearance.  Hansen and Fenchel (2006)  and  Kim et al. (2016) , asserted that the CPN in  M. rubrum  is able to divide at least once in prey starved cultures, since cells that had undergone one cell division all had a CPN. Based on our observations, however, their results could be explained by the retention of EPNs prior to cell division and distribution of EPN to daughter cells to generate CPNs, rather than by division of the CPNs. 
           Through the present study, enlargement of the CPN was inferred to result from an increase in size of only one EPN. However, one question still remains to be answered: what causes enlargement of the CPN. Prior studies ( Hibberd, 1977 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ;  Nam et al., 2016 ) have provided ultrastructural images of the enlarged prey nucleus (i.e., CPN) within  M. rubrum . Here the chromosomes seemed to be untangled or less dense, the nucleolus had a large size and large amounts of nucleoplasm surrounded the expanded nuclear envelope. We also observed similar morphological changes of the CPN under the confocal microscope, with less dense chromosomes and an enlarged nucleolus present in large irregular shaped CPNs ( Supplementary Figure  S2  ). The chromosome just seemed to be loose or swollen, but the possibility of replication cannot be ruled out. Surprisingly, two enlarged nucleoli were found in one CPN, a phenomenon that also appeared in the study of  Johnson et al. (2007) . Nevertheless our quantitative data do not indicate that  M. rubrum  can replicate the CPN and the results seem inconsistent with a recent study by  Qiu et al. (2016) . They observed gene transcripts for prey nucleus replication on field populations of  M. rubrum . Since their study was carried out on field populations, it is difficult to interpret their data. It is possible that  M. rubrum  population they studied function differently than those isolates from Korea, Denmark, and Antarctica that have been studied in detail in laboratory culture. After all six clades (Clades A–F) of the  M. rubrum / M. major  species complex have been described recently ( Herfort et al., 2011 ;  Johnson et al., 2016 ). However, it is also possible that the  M. rubrum  population studied by  Qiu et al. (2016)  functions similar to the ones studied in detail in the laboratory, but the authors may have simply caught  M. rubrum  cells that recently ingested a diving cryptophyte cell. Future studies will show which of the two interpretations are right. 
         
         
           Prey Nucleus Effects on Photosynthetic Ability of  M. rubrum  
            Mesodinium rubrum  is unique among the marine alveolates for its ability to sequester prey nuclei and chloroplasts along with other organelles and show enlargement of the prey nucleus once sequestered. While sequestration of nuclei and chloroplasts along with other prey organelles is well known for a few dinoflagellates species ( Dodge, 1971 ;  Farmer and Roberts, 1990 ;  Horiguchi and Pienaar, 1992 ;  Okamoto and Inouye, 2005 ;  Gast et al., 2007 ;  Yamaguchi et al., 2011 ;  Onuma and Horiguchi, 2013 ,  2015 ;  Kim et al., 2014 ), enlargement of the sequestered prey nucleus has not been reported in any of studies. 
           The sequestered prey nucleus has been inferred to allow the host cell to exploit photosynthetic performance of its sequestered prey chloroplasts; e.g., the dinoflagellates  Amylax triacantha ,  Nusuttodinium aeruginosum , and  N. myriopyrenoides  and the ciliate  M. rubrum  ( Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Kim et al., 2014 ,  2016 ;  Onuma and Horiguchi, 2015 ). A few molecular and transcriptome studies focusing on the photosynthetic ability of  M. rubrum  in association with the sequestered prey nucleus ( Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Lasek-Nesselquist et al., 2015 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ) have shown expression of nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted algal genes. Subsequently, the retained prey nucleus was suggested to mainly contribute to sustained chloroplasts function ( Johnson et al., 2007 ;  Hansen et al., 2012 ;  Lasek-Nesselquist et al., 2015 ;  Kim et al., 2016 ). It has previously been shown that photosynthetic activity in different  M. rubrum  strains declines in prey starved cultures ( Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Hansen and Fenchel, 2006 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ). It has also been shown that the declines in photosynthetic parameters coincided with the loss of CPN (called prey nuclei) from  M. rubrum  cells, implicating a possible functional role for retained prey nuclei ( Johnson and Stoecker, 2005 ;  Johnson et al., 2007 ). Our work confirms that the presence of a CPN substantially affects the photosynthetic performance of the  M. rubrum  chloroplasts. A reduction in prevalence of the CPNs in starved populations of  M. rubrum  led to a significant decline in inorganic carbon uptake while chloroplast number cell -1  showed little change. This result might help to explain the formation of the ‘CCN’ complex; the position could facilitate the gene exchange related with nuclear-encoded, chloroplasts targeted genes for stable photosynthesis, between the host nuclei and prey nucleus ( Martin et al., 1998 ;  Martin and Herrmann, 1998 ). Even though our results imply that a CPN is involved with photosynthetic ability of  M. rubrum , it cannot be ruled out that the ciliate nuclei also participate in the photosynthetic ability of  M. rubrum . We do not know whether retention of a CPN and chloroplasts derived from prey in  M. rubrum  is an evolutionary step toward establishing permanent chloroplasts, but  M. rubrum  is notable for showing the unique photosynthetic performance from the acquired chloroplasts and nucleus of prey. 
            Hansen et al. (2012)  proved that  M. rubrum  chloroplasts derived from  T. amphioxeia  can be replaced by chloroplasts derived from  T. acuta . Whether or not the sequestered prey nucleus was simultaneously replaced, however, remains unknown. Addressing the possibility of replacement of the prey nucleus in  M. rubrum  may enhance our understanding of sequestration, enlargement, and function of the prey nucleus inside  M. rubrum . 
         
         
           Model for CPN Maintenance and Increase in Size 
           Based on the results of our study, we propose the following model to explain the dynamics of acquisition, enlargement, and distribution of prey nuclei to daughter cells in  Mesodinium rubrum . When  M. rubrum  having only three ciliate nuclei (one micronucleus and two macronuclei positioned at the center of the cell) feeds on the cryptophyte  Teleaulax amphioxeia , prey nuclei (i.e., EPNs) are acquired at the periphery of the cell. The number of acquired nuclei is equal to the number of prey ingested ( Figure  9  ). Subsequently, one of the EPNs relocates to the center of the cell (or anterior to the three ciliate nuclei) to become a CPN, thus forming a CCN complex. The newly formed CPN is small at first, but continuously increases in size over time, without fusing with EPNs that persist in the cell. With division of  M. rubrum , the enlarged CPN does not divide and is inherited by only one of the daughter cells, with the other daughter cell having the possibility of receiving one or more of the persisting EPNs. If the daughter cell lacking a CPN receives one or more EPNs, then a single EPN relocates to the center of the cell to form a CCN complex and a CPN which enlarges over time. The inherited CPN continues to enlarge until reaching maximum size as seen in starved  M. rubrum . Once the ‘old’ inherited CPN senesces, it can be replaced by a new CPN if one or more EPNs are present in the peripheral cytoplasm of  M. rubrum  or are acquired through feeding. 
         
       
     
     
       Conclusion 
       Our study show that the sequestered prey nucleus (CPN) associated with the CCN complex (Cryptophyte-Ciliate Nuclear complex) of  M. rubrum  is derived from a single prey nucleus, enlarges over time without fusing with other ingested prey nuclei (EPNs), does not divide, and is inherited by only one daughter cell when  M. rubrum  divides. Also, EPNs present in  M. rubrum  possessing a CPN can be inherited by and form a CPN in the daughter cell that does not receive the parental CPN. How the EPN-CPN system of  M. rubrum  works when the ciliate is fed a mixture of prey species is unknown. Will  M. rubrum  then contain two CPNs or can one CPN control the chloroplasts from two species? To elucidate this, development of species specific molecular techniques is required. Our study was conducted using  M. rubrum  isolated from Danish waters, while reports of fusion of ingested prey nuclei to form the enlarged prey nucleus (i.e., CPN) of the CCN complex ( Kim et al., 2016 ;  Nam et al., 2016 ) was based on a Korean strain (MR-MAL01) of  Mesodinium  cf.  rubrum . Since our Danish  M. rubrum  and the Korean  M . cf.  rubrum  differ at the strain level and may even represent different species, it is possible that the two cultures process ingested prey nuclei in different way. Additional studies using the Korean isolate of  M.  cf.  rubrum  and other isolates of  M. rubrum  from other parts of the world may help to resolve this issue.

         Bioenergy sorghum is targeted for production in water-limited annual cropland therefore traits that improve plant water capture, water use efficiency, and resilience to water deficit are necessary to maximize productivity. A crop modeling framework, APSIM, was adapted to predict the growth and biomass yield of energy sorghum and to identify potentially useful traits for crop improvement. APSIM simulations of energy sorghum development and biomass accumulation replicated results from field experiments across multiple years, patterns of rainfall, and irrigation schemes. Modeling showed that energy sorghum's long duration of vegetative growth increased water capture and biomass yield by ~30% compared to short season crops in a water-limited production region. Additionally, APSIM was extended to enable modeling of VPD-limited transpiration traits that reduce crop water use under high vapor pressure deficits (VPDs). The response of transpiration rate to increasing VPD was modeled as a linear response until a VPD threshold was reached, at which the slope of the response decreases, representing a range of responses to VPD observed in sorghum germplasm. Simulation results indicated that the VPD-limited transpiration trait is most beneficial in hot and dry regions of production where crops are exposed to extended periods without rainfall during the season or to a terminal drought. In these environments, slower but more efficient transpiration increases biomass yield and prevents or delays the exhaustion of soil water and onset of leaf senescence. The VPD-limited transpiration responses observed in sorghum germplasm increased biomass accumulation by 20% in years with lower summer rainfall, and the ability to drastically reduce transpiration under high VPD conditions could increase biomass by 6% on average across all years. This work indicates that the productivity and resilience of bioenergy sorghum grown in water-limited environments could be further enhanced by development of genotypes with optimized VPD-limited transpiration traits and deployment of these crops in water limited growing environments. The energy sorghum model and VPD-limited transpiration trait implementation are made available to simulate performance in other target environments.

       Introduction 
       Predicted increases in world population and development by 2050 are projected to increase the demand for food, forage, biofuels, and bio-products from agriculture by ~50% (Fedoroff and Cohen,  1999 ; Bruinsma,  2009 ; Hall and Richards,  2013 ). Crop production requires substantial water resources due to the linkage between photosynthetic CO 2  uptake/assimilation and transpirational water loss through stomata (Vadez et al.,  2014 ). Insufficient water supply is a major cause of low crop productivity annually and periodic drought can cause large disruptions in agricultural output (Boyer,  1982 ; Boyer et al.,  2013 ). Therefore, to meet future demand for agricultural products, crops with improved water capture, water use efficiency, and drought resilience are needed to enhance sustainable production (Boyer et al.,  2013 ; Vadez et al.,  2013 ). 
        Sorghum bicolor  is a versatile drought resilient C4 grass crop that currently is used to produce grain and forage on more than ~65M ha world-wide. Sorghum crops are particularly important for subsistence farming in the semi-arid tropics (Doggett,  1988 ). Bioenergy sorghum is a relatively new type of sorghum hybrid crop designed for long growing seasons to enhance biomass yield (Rooney et al.,  2007 ; Olson et al.,  2012 ; Gill et al.,  2014 ). The development of high biomass sorghum hybrids was initiated following discovery of a breeding system that allows production of late flowering hybrids from early flowering inbreds (Rooney and Aydin,  1999 ; Rooney et al.,  2007 ). Bioenergy sorghum hybrids have high photoperiod sensitivity due to the combined action of  Ma1, Ma5 , and  Ma6  that inhibit flowering in day lengths greater than 12.4 h (Rooney and Aydin,  1999 ; Murphy et al.,  2011 ,  2014 ; Mullet et al.,  2014 ; Yang et al.,  2014 ). As a consequence, energy sorghum hybrids that develop past the juvenile phase in the spring when day length are &gt;12.4 h do not undergo floral initiation until day lengths decrease below 12.4 h in the fall. The resulting long vegetative growth duration of energy sorghum hybrids, combined with C4 photosynthesis, high radiation interception and use efficiency, and annual cropping seasons that permit rotations and adjustments for economic conditions, make energy sorghum hybrids a productive high biomass crop especially useful for water-limited growing regions (Rooney et al.,  2007 ; Gill et al.,  2014 ; Mullet et al.,  2014 ). 
       Sorghum is amenable to genetic improvement of hybrids, due to a diverse germplasm, good genomics platform, and tractable genetics (Rooney and Aydin,  1999 ; Rooney et al.,  2007 ; Mullet et al.,  2014 ). Breeding and genetic improvement of bioenergy sorghum hybrids has been underway on a small scale for only ~15 years and as a consequence, there are many unexploited opportunities for improving the crop's productivity and resilience. One way to increase the rate of crop improvement is to use models to help identify physiological traits that have significant predicted yield benefits for optimization through genetic selection (Zhu et al.,  2010 ; Hammer et al.,  2016 ). This approach was used in a prior study to examine the utility of increased leaf angle in bioenergy sorghum using structure-function modeling (Truong et al.,  2015 ). The predicted beneficial impact on biomass yield was confirmed by identifying leaf angle QTL and field-testing genotypes with varying leaf angle (Truong et al.,  2015 ). The integration of structure-function modeling, crop-scale modeling, automated phenotyping, and quantitative genetics is expected to further accelerate crop genetic improvement. 
       The Agricultural Production System SIMulator (APSIM) is a crop modeling framework that enables predictions of the growth and productivity of crop species under varying environmental conditions and management practices (McCown et al.,  1996 ; Keating et al.,  2003 ; Holzworth et al.,  2014 ). The sorghum module in APSIM has benefitted from continuous development and improvement since 1994 (Hammer and Muchow,  1994 ), incorporating established models of sorghum phenology, canopy development, growth, and nitrogen use (Sinclair et al.,  1984 ; Rosenthal et al.,  1989 ; Birch et al.,  1990 ; Hammer and Muchow,  1994 ; Chapman et al.,  2000a , b ). APSIM has also been enhanced to model complex adaptive traits and genotype to phenotype predictions (Hammer et al.,  2010 ). In addition to its record of providing accurate predictions of sorghum development (Hammer and Muchow,  1994 ; Kumar et al.,  2009 ; Hammer et al.,  2010 ; Kholová et al.,  2014 ; Lobell et al.,  2015 ), APSIM's modular design provides a flexible platform for examining the impact of variation in traits and physiological processes on plant development. To date, APSIM has been used predominately for modeling grain crops and additional work has demonstrated its efficacy in sugarcane (Nair et al.,  2012 ). APSIM should be similarly effective for examining biomass accumulation in bioenergy sorghum hybrids with long vegetative growth duration. Therefore, we extended the APSIM grain sorghum model to bioenergy sorghum and examined its performance relative to experimental data from field experiments across multiple years and patterns of rainfall and water availability. Additionally, APSIM was used to investigate the potential impact of traits that limit transpiration under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in bioenergy sorghum. 
       VPD describes the difference in water vapor pressure within the leaf and the surrounding air. Since transpiration rate increases with increasing VPD, limiting transpiration under conditions of high VPD has been predicted to contribute to the water use efficiency of grain sorghum and corn (Sinclair et al.,  2005 ; Kholová et al.,  2014 ; Messina et al.,  2015 ). VPD-limited transpiration traits enable water conservation and improve water use efficiency by imposing a restriction on transpiration rate when VPD becomes sufficiently large (Parent et al.,  2009 ; Tardieu et al.,  2009 ; McAdam and Brodribb,  2015 ). Previous experiments have demonstrated that VPD-limited transpiration is a genetically regulated trait in sorghum. Some genotypes display differences in the linear increase in transpiration rate with increasing VPD, whereas other genotypes display a VPD breakpoint, defined as the VPD at which the slope of the linear response between VPD and transpiration rate decreases (Gholipoor et al.,  2010 ; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ; Choudhary and Sinclair,  2014b ; Riar et al.,  2015 ). These sorghum genotypes respond to high VPDs by reducing their transpiration rates, effectively limiting water loss under environmental conditions that result in low transpiration efficiencies, thereby increasing overall crop water use efficiency. 
       The VPD-limited transpiration trait may be especially beneficial for bioenergy sorghum hybrids that are grown in regions subject to high VPD and water limitation. Any daily advantage that the trait confers would potentially be compounded over extended periods of high VPD and water deficit that occur during the crop's long growing season. Moreover, enhancing the resilience of energy sorghum by increasing the crop's tolerance of long periods of water limitation will enable the crop to utilize intermittent rainfall for growth and biomass accumulation. Furthermore, future climate change modeling predicts increases in VPD that will be detrimental to vegetation (Lobell et al.,  2014 ; McDowell et al.,  2016 ), therefore determining the potential beneficial impact of VPD-limited transpiration traits and potential trade-offs on energy sorghum biomass yield and resilience is of great interest. 
       Previous methods for incorporating a limited transpiration trait into crop models imposed a VPD-independent and a VPD-dependent maximum transpiration rate. In grain sorghum, VPD-limited transpiration was modeled as a maximum transpiration rate per unit leaf area, such that the transpiration rate would plateau at the designated maximum regardless of further increases in VPD (Sinclair et al.,  2005 ; Kholová et al.,  2014 ). In maize, limited transpiration was modeled as a piecewise function whereby, at or above a designated VPD (the VPD breakpoint), transpiration rate would plateau and not increase further (Messina et al.,  2015 ). These models are characteristic of some sorghum genotypes but do not capture the full range of VPD modulated transpiration responses reported for sorghum (Gholipoor et al.,  2010 ; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ; Choudhary and Sinclair,  2014b ; Riar et al.,  2015 ). To capture this additional complexity, we implemented a dynamic VPD-limited transpiration modification as part of an energy sorghum model in APSIM and used this modification to examine the effects of a range of VPD-limited transpiration traits on biomass accumulation. Adapting APSIM for bioenergy sorghum and VPD-limited transpiration enables predictions of energy sorghum phenology, biomass accumulation in a range of environments and agronomic practices, and analyses of the impact of the VPD-limited transpiration on biomass accumulation. 
     
     
       Methods 
       
         Crop model simulations for energy sorghum in APSIM 
         The daily progression of sorghum biomass accumulation given environmental data and management practices was simulated using Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM 7.7,  www.apsim.info ) (McCown et al.,  1996 ; Keating et al.,  2003 ; Holzworth et al.,  2014 ). Daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation data for College Station, TX (Latitude 30.58917, Longitude −97.36472) from the beginning of year 2000 to the end of year 2014 were obtained from the Daily Global Historical Climatology Network, GHCN-DAILY (Menne et al.,  2012  access date: January 2016). The values of maximum and minimum radiation per day were obtained from “Maximum and Minimum Radiation Incident On An Equator-pointed Tilted Surface (kWh/m2/day)” from NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) data set for Latitude 30.601, Longitude 96.314 ( https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/ ). The tav_amp APSIM function was used to calculate annual average ambient temperature (TAV) and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature (AMP). The soil depth parameters were adjusted to be reflective of College Station, TX, where energy sorghum root systems rarely extend beyond 1,000 mm below the soil surface. This constraint was implemented by making the 6th soil layer (1200–1500 mm depth) a water table that restricted root growth and water uptake past the 6th soil layer. 
         Crop management practices used for modeling were based on standard methods for growing energy sorghum (Rooney et al.,  2007 ; Olson et al.,  2012 ). Sowing each year was modeled to occur between April 14th and May 1st. The sowing density and plant spacing in rows reflect practices applied in College Station, TX, in 2008 and 2009 with 13.2 plants m −2  and 76 cm row spacing. Fertilization was simulated to apply 100 kg of nitrogen (N) per hectare based on production practices described previously (Olson et al.,  2012 ). The unlimited irrigation regime was implemented using furrow irrigation between rows approximately every 2 weeks if no rainfall occurred and less often when rainfall provided water for plant growth (Olson et al.,  2012 ). For simulations without VPD-limited transpiration, irrigation of 150 mm of water was applied on soil water deficit demand of 50 mm as part of three irrigation scenarios: no irrigation (other than starting with a fully saturated soil profile prior to sowing, rainfall was the only water source), limited irrigation (irrigation stops on July 7th), and unlimited irrigation (irrigation on demand during the growing season). 
       
       
         Adapting APSIM to model delayed flowering due to high photoperiod sensitivity 
         Delayed flowering caused by very high photoperiod sensitivity is a trait that differentiates energy sorghum from most other sorghum crops. As a consequence of this trait, energy sorghum hybrids planted in central Texas in mid-April grow in the vegetative phase for ~150 days and initiate flowering in mid-September when day lengths decrease below 12.4 h (Rooney and Aydin,  1999 ). The implementation of photoperiod sensitivity in the APSIM sorghum module is based on extension of thermal time in the vegetative phase (Hammer et al.,  2010 ; Holzworth et al.,  2014 ). Therefore, thermal time (e.g., photoperiod slope) parameters were set to be consistent with observed time to floral initiation for energy sorghum hybrids such as TX08001 grown in College Station, Texas (Table  1 ). Modeling of energy sorghum hybrid performance other locations and latitudes could be implemented in a similar way by determining thermal time from planting until day lengths are &lt;12.4 h.

              The grain sorghum crop model parameters for a late maturity cultivar described in APSIM sorghum module (apsim.info) were modified to model energy sorghum. Energy sorghum phenology is approximated such that energy sorghum will initiate floral induction in mid-September given College Station, TX, environments as observed (Rooney and Aydin,  1999 ; Olson et al.,  2012 ). Other parameters were modified such that the model output generally resembled measurements of TX08001 in 2008 (Olson et al.,  2012 ) . 
           
         
       
       
         Adapting APSIM sorghum module for VPD-limited transpiration traits 
         In APSIM's sorghum model, daily biomass accumulation is determined primarily from two inputs: radiation energy intercepted by the plant canopy (radiation energy supply) and soil water supply. For a given day, if water supply is not limiting, the amount of radiation intercepted determines biomass accumulation. Daily plant water demand is calculated from radiation energy supply. The required amount of water for transpiration (water demand) needs to be extracted by roots from the soil profile to maximize biomass accumulation. If water available from the soil profile is less than the water required by the plant during canopy gas exchange for maximal biomass accumulation, then water supply reduces daily biomass accumulation. The amount of water utilized by the plant during gas exchange required for biomass accumulation is calculated from plant water demand when soil water supply was sufficient to meet demand, or from available water supply when supply was less than plant water demand. 
         To extend this model, VPD-limited transpiration was introduced into the calculation of potential change in biomass per day by impacting plant water demand as a function of VPD. Daily weather input and biomass accumulation potential were interpolated at hourly timesteps, and for each daytime hour, the daily potential for biomass accumulation restricted by water was calculated as a function of hourly VPD. This effectively introduced the ability for a plant to slow its transpiration rate under conditions of high VPD (e.g., mid-afternoon), in which case the plant would demand less water under conditions of high VPD. Consequently, this slowed the rate of biomass accumulation under conditions of high VPD and reduced the amount of water used in high VPD conditions when transpiration efficiency is low. The calculations are described below, and their implementation in the APSIM sorghum C++ module is made available (see Code Availability). 
         VPD-limited transpiration was modeled using the parameters { vpd   BP  ,  m  1 ,  m  2 } which are typically obtained from experiments quantifying VPD-limited transpiration ( Figure 2 , Table  2 ). A VPD-limited transpiration trait can be characterized by a VPD breakpoint ( vpd   BP  ), the slope of the linear relationship between transpiration rate and VPD for VPDs that are less than the VPD breakpoint ( m  1 ), and the slope of the linear relationship between transpiration rate and VPD for VPDs that are greater than the VPD breakpoint ( m  2 ); these three parameters can be defined in the .xml sorghum file provided by the user. Given these parameters, a daily biomass accumulation      ∑    t  =  s  u  n  r  i  s  e    s  u  n  s  e  t    B   (   t   )     is calculated on an hourly ( t ) basis over the course of a day (sunrise to sunset). In order to evaluate VPD-limited transpiration on an hourly basis, VPD and biomass data calculated from radiation energy supply was interpolated hourly with respect to climate data by implementing the piecewise function described by Eccel ( 2010 ) from sunrise to sunset of sinusoid I and II equations. With this calculation, for each hour,  t , there is an hourly transpiration rate,  T   r  ( t ), based on potential biomass accumulation from radiation energy,  B   r  ( t ), leaf area index,  lai , and an hourly vapor pressure deficit,  vpd ( t ), such that the following can be evaluated (Table  2  describes variables):

         Modeling bioenergy sorghum in APSIM 
         To extend the applicability of APSIM to bioenergy sorghum, parameters of a sorghum genotype distributed with APSIM were modified to simulate bioenergy sorghum characteristics, namely an extended period of vegetative growth, high leaf area index (LAI), leaf number, radiation use efficiency, height, and stem density (Table  1 ). The sorghum model parameters in APSIM were adjusted based on traits measured as part of previous field studies conducted in 2008 and 2009 that characterized the growth and development of the energy sorghum hybrid, TX08001 near College Station, TX (Olson et al.,  2012 ). In the prior field studies, data was collected on the energy sorghum hybrid TX08001 grown using three irrigation regimes: a rainfed environment with no irrigation, a limited irrigation scheme where plants were watered as needed until July 7th (applied in 2008 and 2009) and an unlimited irrigation scheme where plants were watered throughout the season (applied in 2009). Above ground biomass was measured in both years, and in 2008, data on stem height, leaf number, and leaf area index were collected. After parameterization based on 2008 trait data, APSIM simulations were compared to other years and irrigation schemes. 
         Growth simulations of energy sorghum for the unlimited, limited, and no irrigation conditions were qualitatively consistent with field data (Figure  1 ). A photograph of typical field plot of TX08001 at 108 DAS grown with limited irrigation is shown in Figure  1M . The front of the plot has been removed revealing the onset of leaf senescence at lower levels of the canopy that is associated with nitrogen recycling to support production of new leaves at the top of the canopy (Olson et al.,  2012 ,  2013 ). The model largely tracked LAI, height, and number of leaves produced during the 2008 limited irrigation season (Figures  1C–E ). The energy sorghum model also qualitatively reproduced the biomass accumulation trajectories observed in the limited and rainfed plots of 2008 and 2009. In 2008 and 2009, limited irrigation plots produced approximately 4 kg m −2  (~40 Mg hectare −1 ) of dry shoot biomass and unlimited irrigation plots in 2009 produced ~5 kg m −2  (~50 Mg hectare −1 ) of dry shoot biomass. Model predictions of biomass accumulation in 2009 with unlimited irrigation tracked field data for most of the season but predicted somewhat lower biomass accumulation late in the growing season, a trend also observed when modeling biomass accumulation in 2008 under limited irrigation. In the targeted management regimes of energy sorghum, under strictly rainfed conditions, the bioenergy sorghum crop model predicted biomass accumulation that was within the range observed in 2008 mechanical harvests of larger plots (Olson et al.,  2012 ). These results indicate that APSIM is capable of predicting growth and biomass accumulation trajectories observed in field experiments within the margin of uncertainty of available data on field grown bioenergy sorghum across multiple years and water supply conditions.

         The parameterized APSIM energy sorghum model was used to simulate how an energy sorghum crop would perform in the College Station, Texas, environment under different irrigation regimes and rainfall patterns over the annual growing seasons from 2000 to 2014 (Figure  1N ). Using rainfall data from 2000 to 2014 in College Station, three water input regimes were imposed: unlimited, limited, and no irrigation (rainfed). As expected, the crop's ability to accumulate biomass in the three treatments diverges between 60 and 100 DAS when water becomes limiting, that is, when water in the initially saturated soil profile is depleted (Figures  1 B,G,I,K ). Modeling showed that energy sorghum's long duration of vegetative growth allowed water capture from 100 DAS to 200 DAS and improved shoot biomass yield by ~30% in the water-limited production region relative to a crop harvested at 100 DAS. 
         Fluctuations in rainfall and VPD during the 2000–2014 growing seasons in College Station, Texas are shown in Figure  2 . The amount and timing of rainfall was highly variable but generally decreased from planting to ~120 DAS (mid-summer) and then increased again during the latter portion of the growing season (Figure  2A ). Profiles of rainfall patterns in 2008, 2009, and 2010 show that rainfall between 75 and 150 DAS is intermittent and insufficient to recharge the soil profile (Figures  2E–G ). In the location modeled, average daily VPD increased from planting until ~120 DAS then declined until harvest at ~200 DAS (Figure  2B ). VPD also fluctuates significantly on a daily basis (Supplemental Figure  1 ). Increases in VPD generally result in higher rates of transpiration and water uptake from the soil profile by the root system, and lower efficiency of conversion of atmospheric carbon to plant biomass per unit of water transpired (TE) (Figures  2C,D ). In simulations where water is not a limiting factor (unlimited irrigation) and transpiration efficiency is not influencing biomass yield, energy sorghum is predicted to yield 5.4 ± 0.3 (mean ± SD) kg m −2  of biomass while using 1132 ± 82 (mean ± SD) mm m −2  of water during a 200 day growing season in College Station cropping environments. In contrast, in the absence of irrigation, energy sorghum was predicted to produce on average 2.7 ± 0.8 (mean ± SD) kg m −2  of biomass and used 485 ± 120 (mean ± SD) mm m −2  of water (Figure  1N ). The results of modeling indicate that water supply significantly limits sorghum biomass accumulation, especially after 60–75 DAS, in this location consistent with field observations (Olson et al.,  2012 ; Gill et al.,  2014 ; Mullet et al.,  2014 ).

Therefore, the APSIM sorghum model was used to examine the potential utility of traits that limit transpiration at higher VPD for improving the biomass yield, water use efficiency, and resilience of bioenergy sorghum. Previous experimental work demonstrated that VPD-limited transpiration traits are dependent on VPD and sensitive to 1 kPA changes in VPD (Gholipoor et al.,  2010 ; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ; Choudhary and Sinclair,  2014b ; Riar et al.,  2015 ). Energy sorghum crops are exposed to a range of VPDs greater than 1 kPA over the course of a day due to daily variation in temperature (Supplemental Figure  1 ). Therefore, the APSIM model was modified so that the calculated daily water uptake could be altered by a VPD-limited transpiration trait calculated in hourly timesteps, an approach similar to that implemented by Sinclair et al. ( 2005 ), Kholová et al. ( 2014 ), and Messina et al. ( 2015 ). VPD-limited transpiration traits were modeled using two different linear response slopes,  m  1  and  m  2  where the transition between  m  1  and  m  2  is determined by a VPD threshold,  vpd   BP   (Figure  2D , denoted in blue). The potential utility of genotypes with variation in  m  1  or  m  2 , or combinations of VPD-breakpoints and values of  m  2  was examined. Modeling enabled the impact of various combinations of VPD-traits on the time course of biomass accumulation, LAI development and soil water extraction dynamics to be investigated. 
       
       
         Modeling genotypes that vary in  m  1  that lack VPD-breakpoints 
         Modeling was used initially to investigate genotypes that vary in  m  1  slopes that lack a  vpd   BP   (Figure  3 ). Specifically, Tx436 ( m  1  = 6.62; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ), BQL41 ( m  1  = 20.26; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ), BTx623 ( m  1  = 56.3; Gholipoor et al.,  2010 ) and a hypothetical extreme ( m  1  = 200.0) were simulated using the VPD-limited transpiration modification with no  vpd   BP   ( m  1  =  m  2 ) (Figure  3A ). In fully irrigated conditions, genotypes with higher values of  m  1  accumulated more biomass (Figure  3F ). A modeled genotype similar to BTx623 ( m  1  = 56.3) accumulated almost twice as much biomass (an additional ~26 Mg/ha) compared to Tx436 ( m  1  = 6.62) under these conditions (Figure  3F ). Values of  m  1  &gt; 56.3 did not increase end-point biomass accumulation. Interestingly, the genotype with an  m  1  = 20.26 (BQL41) accumulated less biomass during the first 75 days of development in fully irrigated conditions compared to BTx623 ( m  1  = 56.3), however biomass accumulation by the two genotypes was similar between 75 and 200 DAS. This occurred because later in the season when the genotypes reached canopy closure and VPD was higher, both genotypes extracted the maximum available soil water each day.

(A–H)  Growth simulation of plants with no  vpd   BP   ( m  1  =  m  2 ) are plotted with continuous colored lines that correspond to their  m  1  ∈ {6.62, 20.26, 56.3, 200}.  (C,F)  Cumulative biomass,  (D,G)  leaf area index (LAI), and  (E,H)  extractable soil water are plotted as the means and 98% confidence intervals estimated with 50,000 bootstraps for the respective rainfed and unlimited irrigation conditions. 
           
           
         
         In rainfed cropping conditions a genotype with an  m  1  of 56.3 was predicted to yield approximately 2.5 kg m −2  approximately 50% less biomass than in non-water limiting conditions (Figure  3C ). In rainfed environments, increased values of  m  1  on average also resulted in higher biomass accumulation, however, the benefit of a higher  m  1  in water limited environments was much smaller than in fully irrigated conditions (~1–3 Mg/ha) (Figure  3C ). While biomass accumulation was positively related to larger  m  1  values, it came at the expense of leaf area development and maintenance under water limiting conditions (Figure  3D ). During the first 60–75 days of crop development, genotypes with larger  m  1  (BTx623) accumulated biomass more rapidly in rainfed and fully irrigated environments compared to genotypes with lower  m  1  values. The rate of LAI increase was similar in all genotypes until ~60 DAS because leaf area development in all genotypes was limited by thermal time in the model. Genotypes with larger  m  1  values use water more rapidly therefore by 60 DAS the genotype with an  m  1  = 56.3 (BTx623) had depleted ~50% of available soil water in rainfed environments, more than the other genotypes (Figure  3E ). For a genotype similar to BTx623, lack of sufficient water supply in rainfed environments constrained biomass accumulation and leaf area development for the remainder of the season (Figures  3C, D ). Compared to a genotype with a genotype with an  m  1  = 56.3, genotypes with lower  m  1  values used water more slowly and accumulated less biomass in rainfed and fully irrigated conditions (Figures  3C,F ). In rainfed conditions, slower use of water provided additional thermal time for canopy development before soil water was depleted resulting in higher LAI (Figure  3D ). In rainfed environments, modeling predicted that LAI would decrease once soil water resources were expended beginning about 100 DAS (Figures  3D,E ). LAI declined sooner in genotypes with higher  m  1  because they used up water resources more rapidly. Despite lower leaf area after 150 days in rainfed environments, genotypes with higher  m  1  (56.3, 20.26) accumulated similar amounts of biomass between 150 and 200 DAS on average over the 14 years analyzed as the genotype with a lower  m  1  (Tx436,  m  1  = 6.62) 
       
       
         Modeling energy sorghum genotypes with VPD-breakpoints and variation in  m  2  
         The VPD-limited transpiration trait model was next used to model energy sorghum genotypes that regulate transpiration using a  vpd   BP   where the slope of the transpiration rate response to VPD changes from  m  1  to  m  2 . BQL41 is characterized by a low  vpd   BP   of 1.17 kPA and the genotype's transpiration response to VPD is postulated to improve performance of grain sorghum in water limited environments (Choudhary et al.,  2013 ). To examine the physiological effect of BQL41's low  vpd   BP   on biomass yield and water use efficiency of bioenergy sorghum in water-limited environments, biomass accumulation of a VPD-limited transpiration trait that reflects the  m  1  and  vpd   BP   of BQL41 was combined with variation in  m  2  values. Five  m  2  values were evaluated: (a)  m  2  = 7.27, the transpiration rate that was experimentally obtained from the BQL41 genotype, (b)  m  2  = 0.0, a maximum transpiration rate which reflects how VPD-limited transpiration was modeled previously (Sinclair et al.,  2005 ; Kholová et al.,  2014 ; Messina et al.,  2015 ), (c)  m  2  = 20.26, a response that reflects a lack of a  vpd   BP   (i.e.,  m  1  =  m  2  = 20.26), (d)  m  2  = −6.1, and (e)  m  2  = −12.49 transpiration responses to VPD that were experimentally obtained from SC803 and SC35 genotypes by Gholipoor et al. ( 2010 ) and Choudhary et al. ( 2013 ), respectively (Table  3 ). In rainfed College Station environments the total biomass accumulated by each of the genotypes with VPD-breakpoints investigated ranked from largest to smallest was: 2.35 kg m −2  (SC803;  m  2  = −6.1), 2.31 kg m −2  (no  vpd   BP  ;  m  2  = 20.26), 2.29 kg m −2  (maximum limited transpiration;  m  2  = 0), 2.28 kg m −2  (BQL41;  m  2  = 7.27), and 2.25 kg m −2  (SC35;  m  2  = −12.49) (Supplemental Table  1 ). In these simulations, SC803 ( m  2  = −6.1) marginally outperformed the genotype lacking a  vpd   BP   over a 14 year average by 1.6 % (Supplemental Table  1 ).

         The relatively small improvement in biomass yield in genotypes with VPD-breakpoints was further analyzed to identify trade-offs that occur over the course of the growing season in the rainfed environments of College Station, TX (Supplemental Figure  2 ). The genotypes with a  vpd   BP   have slower growth and biomass accumulation at the beginning of the season (through 100 DAS) and accumulate more biomass during the latter part of the season (Supplemental Figure  3D ). This shift in the timing of water use from early in the season to the summer months when VPD is higher may contribute to lower biomass yield even though the trait partially mitigates the influence of higher VPD. Genotypes with the lower  m  2  reach a higher LAI between 100 and 150 DAS than the genotypes with the higher  m  2  (Supplemental Figure  2 ). This trend in genotypes with higher  m  2  is correlated with a reduced rate of depletion of extractable soil water that allows for a longer period of canopy production (Supplemental Figure  2F ). Most genotypes show a significant loss of LAI once soil water supply is depleted beginning between 100 and 150 DAS depending on genotype (Supplemental Figures  2E,F ). Genotypes with a low  m  2  such as SC35 maintain higher LAI for the remainder of the growing season (Supplemental Figure  2E ). 
         Since the VPD-limited transpiration trait has a negative impact on biomass accumulation during the early portion of the season, but a potentially beneficial impact during the summer months, a simulation was run where the trait was induced after 75 DAS in a terminal drought environment to better understand the dynamics involved (Supplemental Figure  3 ). In this simulation, the VPD-limited transpiration trait reduced the rate of water utilization, delayed the onset of leaf senescence, and increased water use efficiency and biomass accumulation. A genotype with no breakpoint accumulated 0.85 kg m −2 , whereas genotypes with VPD-limited transpiration accumulated 1.2 kg m −2  between 75 DAS until all soil water was extracted. Simulations showed that induction of the VPD-limited transpiration trait under well watered conditions reduced biomass yield (Supplemental Figure  3F ). 
       
       
         Integrated modeling of VPD-traits 
         The differences in biomass accumulation relative to timing of water limitation indicates that the benefits of the VPD-limited transpiration trait are greater when VPD is high and water supply is limiting during the cropping season. To examine this dynamic further, years in the College Station cropping environment were identified where the average rainfall per day fell below 1.2 mm between DAS 107–139 given a 75-day sliding window average (Figures  4A,B ). On average, years with lower rainfall from 107 to 139 DAS also had lower total rainfall and higher average VPD (Supplemental Table  1 ). Applying this criterion to rainfed cropping environments of College Station, TX, for 2000—2014, and then evaluating the previous combination of  m  1 ,  m  2 , and  vpd   BP   indicated that the VPD-limited transpiration trait is beneficial in the more water-limited environments, since VPD-limited transpiration plants with negative  m  2  parameters always yielded greater biomass (Figures  4A–C , Supplemental Table  1 ). For example, the sorghum genotype with maximum limited-transpiration ( m  2  = 0) on average yielded more biomass than a sorghum genotype lacking a  vpd   BP   ( m  2  =  m  1  = 20.26) in the water-limited low yield environments (Supplemental Figure  4 ). Moreover, differences in predicted canopy maintenance was correlated with, and may help explain why VPD-limited transpiration plants outperform their non-limited transpiration counterparts (Figures  4D,E ). In summary, more restrictive transpiration responses associated with more negative  m  2  values perform progressively better in water-limited, low-yielding environments that lead to loss of canopy, but progressively worse in higher rainfall conditions (Figures  4A,B ). 
         
           Figure 4 
           
              Performance of genotypes with VPD-limited transpiration traits determined in years with low and higher rainfall from 107 to 139 DAS and determined by canopy maintenance. (C)  Boxplots show the biomass difference across 14 years between genotypes with a VPD-limited transpiration trait and the genotype that lacks a  vpd   BP   ( m  2  = 20.26). The notches represent the 95% confidence interval of the median. The red square represents the means. These statistics are plotted against end biomass accumulated (DAS 200) by the genotype that lacks a  vpd   BP  , where the vertical sets of plots are separated by years categorized on the  (A,B)  water supply condition and  (D,E)  canopy divergence condition.  (A,B)  For the drought condition, rainfall per day is calculated from sliding windows of 75 days. For sliding windows that center from DAS 107 to 139, if the average rainfall per day ever falls below 1.2 mm, then the year is considered a drought year. The mean, standard deviation, and entire range of rainfall in sliding windows for the years considered low and high are plotted, respectively. The center of sliding windows evaluated for the water supply condition is highlighted orange.  (D,E)  For the canopy divergence condition, where the vertical sets of plots are separated by the condition that occurs in the latter half of the cropping season. For each year, for each pairwise comparison between a genotype with and without a  vpd   BP  , and for each day in the latter half of the cropping season (≥ 100 DAS), if the canopy of genotype lacking a  vpd   BP   senesced (&lt; 0.5 LAI) and the genotype with a  vpd   BP   maintained a larger canopy, then VPD-limited transpiration genotype (with a  vpd   BP  ) was predicted to out perform the genotype lacking a  vpd   BP  . LAI is plotted as averages of the conditions met and the 12.5–87.5 inter-percentile range. 
           
           
         
         To examine the influence of all three parameters describing VPD-limited transpiration,  vpd   BP   and  m  2  were varied within the genetic range observed to date for sorghum, and their impact on biomass yields given different  m  1  parameters were evaluated ( m  1  ∈ {6.62, 20.26, 56.3}). A range of  vpd   BP   values ( vpd   BP   ∈ [1.17, 2.91]) representing the range bounded by BQL41 and SC35, respectively, and  m  2  values ( m  2  ∈ [−12.49, 56.3]), the range bounded by SC35 and BTX623, respectively, were explored (Gholipoor et al.,  2010 ; Choudhary et al.,  2013 ). Combinations of these parameters were simulated in rainfed College Station, TX, environments of 2000—2014 cropping seasons (Figure  5 ). The total biomass accumulated at 200 DAS was used as a measurement of seasonal crop productivity. These productivity landscapes illustrate the influence of VPD-limited transpiration traits, and indicate that, on average, in the target environment of College Station, TX,  m  1  is the greatest driver of average productivity of the sorghum crop. All simulated genotypes with an  m  1  = 56.3 produced more biomass than those with an  m  1  = 20.26 or 6.62, regardless of  m  2  and  vpd   BP  . Contour plots of the three  m  1  values show that the extent of phenotypic variation introduced by the other two parameters  m  2  and  vpd   BP   is influenced by the magnitude of  m  1 , where the variation in cumulative biomass increases as  m  1  decreases.

 m  1  was varied to reflect the extremes (6.62, Tx426, and 56.3, BTx623) and a moderate transpiration rate (20.26, BQL41).  (B) 
 m  2  ∈ [−12.49, 56.3] and  vpd   BP   ∈ [1.17, 2.91] are evaluated for each  m  1  and the predicted average end biomass was interpolated to construct the topological surfaces.  (D–E)  The topology of each  m  1  surface is also plotted two-dimensionally, with contour lines to depict variation of end biomass at 200 DAS. The red star in panel ( D ) represents the VPD-limited transpiration parameters of BQL41. 
           
           
         
         The results of modeling show that genotypes with a high  m  1  (~56) accumulate more biomass when soil water resources are not limiting during the early portion of the season, and that the VPD-breakpoint trait is beneficial when water is limiting during the middle of the growing season when VPD is higher. There may exist a theoretical  m  2  for  m  1  = 56.3 that would be predicted to increase productivity beyond the 0.2% in the observed parameter space. For an  m  1  = 56.3, the exploration of a theoretical  m  2  outside what has been previously observed for VPD-limited-transpiration predicted that an  m  2  = −290 with a  vpd   BP   = 2.05 would increase biomass by 6.5%, yielding an average of 2.73 kg m −2  in rainfed College Station, TX (2000-2014) (Figure  6 ). This extreme  m  2  = −290 would be reflective of a genotype that essentially stops transpiration at VPDs higher than its  vpd   BP  . Furthermore, observation of the fitness landscape suggests that it is not essential to find the exact combination of  vpd   BP   and  m  2 , but that there is a gradual ridge constructed by combinations of the two VPD-limited transpiration parameters that would improve biomass accumulation by ≥5% (Figure  6 ). This ridge shows the relationship between the  vpd   BP   and  m  2  for increasing biomass by ≥5% in rainfed College Station, TX (2000–2014) in the VPD-limited transpiration diagram, where as  vpd   BP   increased, the range of  m  2  parameters that could be combined for beneficial productivity increases. This relationship with  vpd   BP   is likely related to the effect of VPD on transpiration efficiency,  TE , which is inversely proportional to VPD through the  TE   c   coefficient:    T  E  =    T    E    c      v  p  d     .

       Discussion 
       Crop modeling and structure-function trait analyses can be used to help identify constraints that limit plant productivity, assess the benefits of traits, and to increase productivity by optimizing crop deployment across variable environments. Since energy sorghum is a relatively new C4 grass biomass crop with an unusually long vegetative growth phase, crop modeling could help identify traits useful to select in breeding programs. The APSIM bioenergy sorghum model developed in this study was able to replicate the developmental time course of leaf area development, leaf number, plant height and biomass accumulation observed in field trials in College Station, Texas. Field data from other locations/years and from newer energy sorghum hybrids would be useful to further validate and enhance the accuracy of modeling predictions. In addition, collection of detailed information on soil profiles, root system development, architecture, rates of soil water extraction and information on water deficit induced changes in ABA levels would further improve the energy sorghum model and to enable modeling of root traits in conjunction with canopy architecture and VPD-transpiration traits. 
       Model evaluation was done using the College Station, TX, cropping environment, a location with a long growing season (~200 days) and hot and dry summers where bioenergy sorghum hybrids are currently under selection in a breeding program. In fully irrigated conditions, modeling and field data show that energy sorghum has the genetic potential to accumulate ~50 Mg/hectare per year (Olson et al.,  2012 ). However, due to sorghum's water use efficiency and drought resilience during the vegetative phase, it is likely that energy sorghum will often be grown in water limited environments less suitable for other crops. Under rainfed conditions where the median rainfall over the growing season used for the simulations was 52.3 cm, bioenergy sorghum is projected to yield approximately 25 Mg hectare −1  per year. This model prediction is consistent with the biomass yield of TX08001 (~15–26 Mg hectare −1 ) grown without irrigation in large plots that were machine harvested in 2008 and 2009 (Olson et al.,  2012 ). Modeling of energy sorghum production in this location based on 2000–2014 environments indicated that energy sorghum would capture additional water resources and increase biomass yield by ~30% by extending the growing season from ~100–120 days typical of grain crops to 200 days. A crop designed to capture the additional water resources during a long growing season in this environment would benefit from high water use efficiency and resilience to water deficit. Sorghum exhibits many useful traits for water limited environments including high cuticular wax, deep rooting capacity, induction of leaf rolling and osmotic adjustment in response to water deficit, stay-green, and VPD-limited transpiration traits (Borrell et al.,  2006 ). In this study the APSIM bioenergy sorghum model was used to examine the utility of VPD-limited transpiration traits by evaluating the impact of VPD modulated transpiration in hourly intervals during the day. The model extension was used to identify the benefits and trade-offs associated VPD-limited transpiration traits during growing seasons using College Station, TX environments as the context for this case study (mean ± SD: 56 ± 18 cm of rainfall per cropping season for 2000–2014). 
       Prior studies demonstrated that limited transpiration can result in improved grain yield in drought and heat stressed environments by shifting water utilization from the vegetative and booting phases to the anthesis and post anthesis phases where grain yield is more sensitive to water deficit (Sinclair et al.,  2005 ; Kholová et al.,  2014 ; Messina et al.,  2015 ). This change in the timing of water use improves harvest index and reduces the risk of large reductions in grain associated with water limitation during the reproductive phase (Messina et al.,  2015 ). The improvement is not attained if water is not sufficiently limited, an emergent property associated with limited transpiration traits in grain sorghum (Kholová et al.,  2014 ; Hammer et al.,  2016 ). We hypothesized that VPD-limited transpiration traits could also be beneficial for energy sorghum but for different reasons since the crop is harvested for biomass and grows most of the season in the vegetative phase. The analysis showed that restriction of transpiration by reducing  m  1  or by VPD-limited transpiration involving low VPD-breakpoints, reduced biomass accumulation early in the season and that this had a negative impact on overall biomass yield. There are several factors that could explain this prediction. First, at the start of the growing season the soil profile is saturated and excess rainfall is not captured due to run off until a portion of the soil water has been used for biomass production or is lost through evaporation. In this part of the season, modeling showed that genotypes with high  m  1  values like BTx623 that accumulate biomass and use water at a high rate outperform genotypes with lower  m  1  values. If a higher rate of biomass accumulation also results in more rapid leaf area development, then this would increase the efficiency of radiation interception during the phase of canopy development (0–60 DAS). However, the results showed that a higher biomass accumulation rate did not influence LAI development, a topic worth further investigation. Second, shifting water use for biomass accumulation from the early portion of the season (0–75 DAS) when average VPD is lower to later in the season (75–150 DAS) when VPD is higher and TE is lower reduces water use efficiency. The negative impact of this shift in the timing of water use can be mitigated in part by VPD-breakpoint limited transpiration traits. However, genotypes with current  vpd   BP   and  m  2  values still use water at higher VPD in the summer, although at lower rates, compared to water used at lower VPD during the first portion of the planting season. This interpretation is consistent with the predicted benefits of a theoretical  m  2  that completely shuts off transpiration above the  vpd   BP  . In that hypothetical genotype, transpiration would be restricted to VPD below the breakpoint during the entire growing season mitigating the impact of shifting the seasonal timing of water use. Third, in high rainfall years, VPD-limited transpiration could reduce the use of all available water resources for biomass production, especially when significant rainfall occurs in the last 60 days of the growing season. These trade-offs may help explain why in optimization simulations (Figure  5 ), genotypes with higher  m  1  values and higher VPD-breakpoints (i.e.,  m  1  = 56.3,  vpd   BP   = 2.05) were found to accumulate more biomass in the environments analyzed because these parameters allowed maximal biomass accumulation early in the growing season. 
       The value of  vpd   BP   and  m  2  traits that restrict use of water during portions of the day with high VPD and low TE for energy sorghum was evident during the summer months when VPD is high and water supply is limited. In a simulated summer terminal drought environment, genotypes with this type of VPD-limited transpiration trait accumulated more biomass compared to genotypes lacking the trait consistent with higher TE (Supplemental Figure  3 ). The trait also slowed the use of water and delayed the onset of leaf senescence that begins when most of the soil water supply has been depleted. The delay or reduction in the extent of leaf senescence during summers with low rainfall would improve the crop's ability to use rainfall that occurs in the fall for biomass accumulation without the added cost and delay involved in rebuilding the canopy. The value of the VPD-limited transpiration trait was also found to be higher in environments with more elevated VPD and lower rainfall. Examining the rainfall distribution and its effect on VPD-limited transpiration trait impacts showed that in years when water supply was low during the summer months, genotypes with  m  2  = −12.49 gained 20% more biomass than genotypes lacking a  vpd   BP  . However, in years with higher summer rainfall these genotypes generate 10% less biomass, illustrating the trade-off associated with this trait (Supplemental Table  1 ). 
       Efforts to identify optimal trait ideotypes for specific crops and environments has been promoted as a way to speed up the rate of crop genetic improvement. For example, a maize root ideotype that is steep, deep and cheap has been identified and used to guide genotype selection and testing (Lynch,  2013 ). Consideration of the benefits and trade-offs of VPD-limited transpiration in energy sorghum in this study suggest that a beneficial ideotype would combine; (i) a high  m  1  and rapid leaf area development during the early portion of the season to maximize biomass accumulation under conditions of low VPD and high water supply and, (ii) induction of a VPD-limited transpiration trait ( m  2  &lt; −200) later in the season when VPD is higher, possibly in response to water deficit. Prior research showed that traits that limit transpiration can be environmentally triggered by changes in VPD (Lobet et al.,  2014 ; Vadez et al.,  2014 ; McAdam and Brodribb,  2015 ), by altering the level/activity of root aquaporins (Choudhary and Sinclair,  2014a ), and by foliar accumulation of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) (Assmann et al.,  2000 ; Bauer et al.,  2013 ; McAdam and Brodribb,  2015 ; McAdam et al.,  2015 ) that reduces stomatal aperture and plant transpiration (Tardieu and Davies,  1992 ; Parent et al.,  2009 ; Boyer,  2010 ; Cutler et al.,  2010 ). Stomatal closure can be further engineered via the ABA pathway, whereby application of agrochemicals on plants expressing genetically engineered ABA receptors drastically reduces transpiration on demand (Park et al.,  2015 ). Genetic engineering approaches like these may provide a means to design plants with inducible and more negative  m  2  that enhance biomass yield in water limited environments. This type of genotype would be useful for environments that experience summer water deficit or terminal drought. 
       Determining target production environments for energy sorghum with VPD-limited transpiration will be critical for capturing the utility of the trait as well as in screening for energy sorghum hybrids that exhibit VPD-limited transpiration (Tardieu,  2012 ). Given the ideotype described above, selection for genotypes with high rates of LAI development and biomass accumulation during the first 75 DAS, combined with selection for genotypes that show delayed leaf senescence under water limiting conditions could be employed. Numerous QTL for stay-green have been identified in sorghum, and a subset of these loci may modulate VPD-traits that restrict transpiration at high VPD. High resolution yield mapping, and landscape models are being used to optimize crop productivity, yield stability, and return on investment by considering alternative distributions of available crops on perennial and annual cropland. For example, analysis of production regions in the US mid-west identified the potential utility of  Miscanthus , a high biomass perennial C4 grass, for perennial cropland (Eranki et al.,  2013 ). In a similar way, energy sorghum, with its high biomass yield, water use efficiency and resilience to water deficit could be usefully deployed in annual cropland landscapes, including sub-portions of fields that have shallow soils that are more often subject to water deficit. The APSIM energy sorghum crop model could be used in conjunction with landscape design modeling to optimize utilization of this new high biomass crop. 
       In conclusion, this study (i) demonstrated that modeling of energy sorghum in the APSIM framework is able to track field growth and biomass accumulation in different environments, (ii) extended the daily APSIM-sorghum model to incorporate hourly VPD-limited transpiration, (iii) found that VPD-limited transpiration can improve crop productivity in water-limiting environments by increasing TE and by maintenance of crop canopies to enable utilization of sporadic rainfall, and (iv) this model is made available for further evaluation of bioenergy sorghum production in other targeted environments and for other traits such as facultative CAM (Borland et al.,  2009 ) that could further enhance water use efficiency and drought resilience.

         Increasing CO 2  concentrations are strongly controlled by the behavior of established forests, which are believed to be a major current sink of atmospheric CO 2 . There are many models which predict forest responses to environmental changes but they are almost exclusively carbon source (i.e., photosynthesis) driven. Here we present a model for an individual tree that takes into account the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth rates, as well as control mechanisms within the tree that influence its diameter and height growth over time. This new framework is built on process-based understanding combined with differential equations solved by numerical method. Our aim is to construct a model framework of tree growth for replacing current formulations in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, and so address the issue of the terrestrial carbon sink. Our approach was successfully tested for stands of beech trees in two different sites representing part of a long-term forest yield experiment in Germany. This model provides new insights into tree growth and limits to tree height, and addresses limitations of previous models with respect to sink-limited growth.

       1. Introduction 
       Forests are an important component of the global carbon cycle and are currently thought to be a major sink of atmospheric CO 2  (Bonan,  2008 ; Pan et al.,  2011 ). Being able to predict the future responses of forests is therefore of great interest. Many models have been used to address this issue, but they are almost exclusively carbon source-driven, with plants at any particular location treated as a pool, or pools, of carbon mainly driven by photosynthesis (e.g., Cramer et al.,  2001 ; Anav et al.,  2013 ; Friend et al.,  2014 ). However, it is likely that many other factors, such as the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth rates, as well as control mechanisms within the tree, have large influences on forest responses (Körner,  2003 ; Fatichi et al.,  2014 ). A few research groups have addressed the issue of sink-limited growth in a modeling context with respect to carbon sequestration. The potential for sink-limited growth to affect carbon storage and treeline position was addressed by Leuzinger et al. ( 2013 ) using a global vegetation model. However, their approach was highly empirical and only addressed temperature limitations. A more mechanistic approach was presented by Schiestl-Aalto et al. ( 2015 ), in which a tree-level carbon balance model was constructed with both carbon source and sink parameterizations. The sink parameterizations were based on thermal-time and included different ontogenetic effects between tissue types and xylogenetic processes for secondary growth. However, while this paper makes a significant contribution, the various parameterizations were very simply incorporated, with no effect of moisture on wood growth, fixed durations for xylem enlargement, and no overall tree growth across years. Gea-Izquierdo et al. ( 2015 ) also presented a tree-level model parameterization that addressed the effect of growth processes independently of photosynthesis, and in this case looked particularly at soil moisture effects. However, they did not explicitly treat meristem growth, but instead used modified allocation coefficients depending on temperature and soil water. 
       Grossman and DeJong ( 1994 ) examined the consequences of explicit consideration of sink-limited growth for growth partitioning through the growing season in fruit trees. Sink growth was parameterized using a priority order and as a function of carbohydrate supply up to potential rates for different tissues, which were modulated by daily temperature and season. It was concluded that source and sink limit at different times of the year, with carbohydrate supply limiting stem growth during the spring and autumn periods, presumably related to the total sink strength being maximal at those times. Derived from this type of approach, a number of so-called “Functional-Structural Plant Models” (FSPMs) have been developed which typically explicitly consider both source and sink functions (Allen et al.,  2005 ). While the emphasis of these models has been on allocation to plant form, the focus on sinks makes them relevant for the sink-source debate, and potentially useful tools to address it. However, as far as we know they have not been directly used for this purpose. The LIGNUM model (Perttunun,  2009 ), for example, computes stem growth using available photosynthate in order to conform to the pipe model, based on foliage area. The tree grows as a coordinated whole, and storage is not considered. It has primarily been used to study the three-dimensional aspects of crown shape and light capture. 
       Most of the published growth and yield models that are routinely applied to forest ecosystem management and scenario analyses are based on statistical relationships between tree growth and environmental conditions (Pretzsch et al.,  2007 ). Thus, they inherently consider the sink aspect of growth, in terms of parameterized resource-growth relationships, more than the source approach. Examples are the individual tree models TASS (Purves et al.,  2008 ), SILVA (Pretzsch et al.,  2002 ), PROGNAUS (Sterba and Monserud,  1997 ), SORTIE (Pacala and Deutschman,  1995 ), MELA (Hynynen,  2002 ), and HEUREKA (Wikström et al.,  2011 ). They represent successful but maybe too exclusively sink-oriented models, in which new knowledge of tree responses to environmental conditions is difficult to integrate due to their empirical nature. In contrast, the generation of mainly source-driven models such as BALANCE (Grote and Pretzsch,  2002 ), TREEDYN (Bossel,  1991 ), and 3PG (Landsberg and Waring,  1997 ) represent hypotheses about biogeoeco-physiological mechanisms, but so far are little established beyond scientific applications. This is mainly due to the lack of evaluation and comparison with empirical growth and yield records. In response to this current one-sided focus on modeling either taking the sink or the source aspect into account, an integration of both seems most promising for taking forward understanding and prognosis of tree and stand growth. 
       Here we present a new framework for addressing tree growth responses to environmental change, building on knowledge of tree physiology to develop approaches for predicting the development of an individual tree, and thereby enabling a better understanding of forest responses to environmental change than purely source-driven models can achieve, as well as addressing the limitations of previous sink-limited approaches. Our aim is to derive an approach that can be applied in global models, specifically Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). Therefore, we seek the minimal level of detail necessary in order to compute behavior at the global scale, and to be compatible with the other highly aggregated process representation in DGVMs. 
       In this paper we suggest that this objective can be realized using differential models, that is to say growth models using differential equations. We propose here a first differential model taking into account control mechanisms and the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth within trees together with the carbon balance, as well as direct environmental controls on meristematic activity. The paper is presented as follows. First we make several hypotheses concerning physiological considerations, then we give a description of the model. We show how the model is used to predict tree height and stem volume in two sets of three different stands of beech trees. Finally, we discuss the results and the behavior of the model in several situations. 
     
     
       2. Model and framework 
       
         2.1. General considerations 
         To describe the development of the tree, we suppose that it has two types of meristems, apical and lateral, and that the apical meristem increases the height through sustaining primary growth, while the lateral meristem (i.e., the vascular cambium) increases the radius through sustaining secondary growth. We recognize that trees will usually have many separate apical meristems distributed across many branches, but for convenience we treat these together as one apical meristem; we also ignore apical root growth for now. We further assume that the stem can be represented by a cylinder and that the crown (i.e., the branches and foliage) occupies a cylindrical volume and has dimensions that are proportional to the stem dimensions, i.e., the crown depth is proportional to the height of the tree stem and its radius to the radius of the tree stem. In this way we need only obtain information about the radius  r  and the height  h  of the stem to describe the growth of the tree. Future developments will include introducing other crown and stem shapes, as well as root meristems. Here our objective is to keep the model as simple as possible in order to explore the realism of its fundamental assumptions. 
         In order to derive the dynamics of  r  and  h  we need three types of equations: 
         
           
             constitutive equations—related to the structure of the tree; 
           
           
             control equations—representation(s) of the intrinsic controls that the tree has on itself; 
           
           
             carbon balance equations—related to the balance of carbon between the tree and its environment, and the balance within the tree. 
           
         
       
       
         2.2. Constitutive equations: allometric relationships 
         Physiologically, plant growth is sustained by meristems producing new cells which subsequently enlarge and increase in mass (Aloni,  1987 ). We suppose that for each type of meristem, growth is proportional to its volume, that is to say that the mass of carbon allocated to a meristematic region will depend proportionally on the volume of meristem, which determines the maximum potential production rate of new cells. 
         We also suppose that a tree controls the activities of the meristems and therefore the relative demand for carbon  between  the meristematic regions: it can favor either height or diameter growth in this way, depending on environmental signals. Moreover, we suppose that this is the only control the tree has on its growth. With this hypothesis we soon get:
  (1)      d  h   h   =  2   α  2     d  r   r     
where α 2  is the ratio of activities between the apical and lateral meristems, i.e., when the activity of the lateral meristem produces 1 g of carbon growth, α 2  g of carbon growth occurs from the apical meristem. It is the control parameter. 
         Note that we suppose here that the volume of the apical meristem is proportional to the top surface area of the (cylindrical) stem and that the volume of the lateral meristem is proportional to the lateral surface area of the stem. This hypothesis is used as it is more realistic than assuming that the volume of the lateral and apical meristems are proportional to the volume of the tree, i.e., that the thickness of the lateral meristem area increases proportionally with the radius and the thickness of apical meristem increases proportionally with height. Although even under this alternative hypothesis we would get the same type of equation with α 2  being the proportion of growth per unit of volume of apical meristem relative to proportional lateral growth, only adding a numerical coefficient in front of α 2 . 
         Knowing the definition of the volume and integrating we get the following constitutive equations:
  (2)    h  =  γ   r   2   α  2       
  (3)     M  c   =   g  1    r  2   h     
         We recognize Equation (2) as the usual allometric relationship where γ is a constant. As it is true for any time  t , it can be expressed as      h    0    /    r    0    2    α    2       , with  h  0  and  r  0  the height and radius at some time origin  t  = 0. 
         Equation (3) is simply the definition of the volume of the stem plus canopy (containing the branches and leaves) in relation to its mass,  M  c . We assume naturally that branches, stem, and leaves have different densities, but for each of them we suppose that their mass is proportional to  r  2  ×  h  with potentially a geometrical coefficient. That implies that the general mass is proportional to  r  2  ×  h , and in Equation (3),  g  1  is the global proportionality coefficient. Therefore,  g  1  takes into account the density of the stem, the density of the branches and foliage, their contribution to the mass of the tree, and geometric factors.  g  1  can therefore be found using the proportionality coefficients we assumed between crown radius and stem radius and crown height and stem height, and their relative densities. Or if we call  a  the geometrical factors and  d  the densities:  g  1  =  a foliage d foliage   +  a branches d branches   +  a stem d stem  . Here  a  takes into account the geometry and the volume of each element. 
       
       
         2.3. Control mechanism of the tree 
         We want now to take into account the intrinsic control that the tree has on itself, parameterized in our model by α 2 , the ratio between the activities of the apical and lateral meristems. For this we need to consider what happens physiologically (for convenience we use teleological terminology): the tree uses internal controls to be able to adapt its shape and physiology to the surrounding environment, for instance other competing trees (e.g., Ritchie,  1997 ), through phytohormonal signaling networks (Brackmann and Greb,  2014 ; Aloni,  2015 ). Many behaviors could be taken into account, but here we focus on the behavior of a tree competing for light by trying to grow taller faster than its competitors by increasing α 2 . The modeled tree is assumed to detect the presence of surrounding trees by sensing the ratio of downwelling red radiation (i.e., wavelengths between 655 and 665 nm) to downwelling far-red radiation (i.e., wavelengths between 725 and 735 nm). A low ratio signals potentially more neighboring trees and therefore a potential threat of shading. In that case the tree reacts by increasing the activity of the apical meristem relative to the lateral meristem, while a higher ratio potentially means no threat and so the tree reacts by balancing the activities of the two meristems as it needs to compete less for light (Franklin,  2008 ). We hypothesize that this reaction can be modeled as:
  (4)     α  2   =   α  0   exp  (  −   α  3    R  a   )     
         Where α 0  is the highest limit for α 2  beyond which the tree breaks due to mechanical failure, and  R  a  is the ratio of received downwelling red:far-red ratio. α 3  is a scaling parameter such that α 0  exp(−α 3 ) is the value of α 2  when the tree is unshaded (i.e., when it detects no other tree around). 
         This approach is based on the findings of several studies (e.g., Morgan and Smith,  1976 ; Franklin,  2008 ). In particular, Morgan and Smith ( 1976 ) observed the laboratory behavior of two similar young trees grown for 21 days with the same intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), but different red:far-red ratios. They experimentally obtained a relationship which, extended by limited development for short trees, is coherent with the relationship we give in Equation (4). 
         A potential limitation to our approach is that we may not have access to direct measurements of  R  a . For a lone tree this would not be a real problem: the allometric relationship would be constant in our model and the red:far-red ratio maximal. For individual trees growing in a stand in a forest, however, the situation is different as the trees shade each other. 
         Finding a dependency rule of the red:far-red ratio for trees in a stand is therefore a challenge that does not seem to be overcome yet. Because of this and our desire to keep the model simple  1  , when we do not have access to measurements of the red:far-red ratio we make the assumption that α 2  is constant for each stand, as it would be for a lone tree. When the value of this constant is required, it will be estimated as a typical value consistent with the empirical allometric relationship. This is likely to be our most limiting factor as we are here trying to model the internal control that the tree has on itself, which is probably the most complicated phenomenon to take into account, and likely the least-well understood component of our model (cf. Li et al.,  2011 ; Aloni,  2015 ). Although the model seems to work realistically, further work may require a more precise dependency of the red:far red ratio. 
       
       
         2.4. Carbon balance 
         The variation of carbon in the tree over time can be written as the sum of the carbon used for volume growth and the carbon stored:
  (5)      d   M   tot      d  t    =    d   M  c     d  t    +    d  (  (  S  −   S  1   )     g  1     (  1  +   S  1   )    π  h   r  2   )    d  t      
where  M   c   is the carbon used for volume growth,      S     c     =  S      g    1       (   1  +    S    1     )     π  h    r    2      the carbon stored,  S  is defined as carbon stored per unit volume of stem,      S       c    0       =   (   S  -    S    1     )       g    1       (   1  +    S    1     )     π  h    r    2      is the carbon stored above the storage limit  S  1  under which the tree is considered in danger. This distinction has a physical interpretation and therefore in this model the density of the tree can then be seen as a standard density related to the carbon used for growth plus an increase of density due to the storage. 
         We also know that the variation of carbon is given by:
  (6)      d   M   tot      d  t    =  A  (  Q  1  ,   C  g   ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )  −   C  1   h   r  2   −     C  2   (  1  +   S  1   )     g  1   π     S  c     
where  A  is the carbon assimilation due to gross photosynthesis minus a foliage respiration part proportional to photosynthesis, while  C  1  is a constant grouping a part of the respiration and a litter component proportional to the volume, together with the geometrical factor  g  1 π (such that  C  1 / g  1 π is the respiration and litter component constant). We assume here that there is no other litter component, that is to say that litter is completely proportional to the volume of the stem. We note that this also means that the litter is proportional to the volume of the crown with our previous assumptions. Also we assumed here that we are dealing with trees where the living volume can be approximated as proportional to the total volume. This is an approximation and further work could include a variable corrective coefficient, however this is a secondary issue compared to the main advance of this model concerning sink-limited growth. Finally,  C  2  is the same type of constant but for the carbon storage.  A  is assumed to depend on PAR ( Q 1), the concentration of CO 2  in the atmosphere ( C   g  ), temperature ( T ), water potential (ψ), and the dimensions of the tree ( h  and  r ). 
         Therefore:
  (7)      d   M  c     d  t    +    d   S    c  0       d  t    =  A  (  Q  1  ,  C  g  ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )  −  C  h   r  2   −     C  2   (  1  +   S  1   )     g  1   π     S  c      
         The system is so far incomplete as there needs to be a relationship that controls which part of the carbon is allocated to growth and which part is allocated to storage. Also, the volume growth of the tree is sustained by meristematic cell division and enlargement, with a maximal rate determined by intrinsic physiological limits or environmental controls. 
         We assume that the tree grows in volume as much as it can, as long as it keeps enough storage to avoid being in danger, such as for repairing damage and surviving poor growing seasons. We assume that there is one tree specific storage pool, although we acknowledge that localized storage with various turnover times are more realistic (Sprugel et al.,  1991 ; Palacio et al.,  2014 ; Richardson et al.,  2015 ). Therefore, if there is enough carbon assimilation then the rate of growth is equal to the meristem-sustained growth-rate limit and the storage can increase using the difference of these two. Also, if the carbon assimilation rate becomes too low but there is enough storage, then the storage delivers carbon to the meristematic region to maintain a rate of growth equal to its maximal sustainable rate. Then density decreases as the carbon of the storage is used to maintain the volume growth. This is likely to occur for instance when buds appear while photosynthesis is not yet high enough to support the maximal growth potential due to meristem reactivation (note that bud-burst and other seasonal phenological phenomena are not yet treated by the model). However, if there is not enough carbon assimilation or storage then the rate of growth is equal to the carbon assimilation rate and the storage per unit volume remains constant. 
         This behavior can be translated into evolution equations. As growth occurs at a cellular level we can assume that the maximal meristem growth is proportional to the volume of meristems. We denote this maximal meristem-sustained growth per volume by  R  max , the volume of the meristems by  V  me . 
         If there is enough photosynthesis or storage, i.e.,
  (8)    if   A  (  Q  1  ,  C  g  ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )  −  C  h   r  2   −   C  2   S  h   r  2   &gt;   R   max     V   me     or   S  &gt;   S  1     
then:
  (9)      d   M  c     d  t    =     R   max     V   me      1  +    (  S  −   S  1   )    (  1  +   S  1   )        
  (10)        d  (  (  S  −   S  1   )  π     g  1     (  1  +   S  1   )    h   r  2   )    d  t    =  A  (  Q  1  ,  C  g  ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )  −  C  h   r  2                                                   −   C  2   S  h   r  2   −    d   M  c     d  t        
  (11)      but if   A  (  Q  1  ,  C  g  ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )     −     C  h   r  2   −      C  2   S  h   r  2   ≤   R   max     V   me                                                       and   S     =      S  1       
then
  (12)      d   M  c     d  t    =  A  (  Q  1  ,  C  g  ,  T  ,  ψ  ,  h  ,  r  )  −  C  h   r  2   −   C  2   S  h   r  2     
  (13)      d  S    d  t    =  0     
         Note that the case where for some reason the carbon assimilation by photosynthesis is insufficient even to cover the cost of maintenance is treated by Equations (8–10). In that case there will be a depletion of storage to sustain the maintenance cost until the storage reaches a critical level or until the photosynthesis rate increases sufficiently. 
       
       
         2.5. Modeling photosynthesis 
         We assume the following dependencies of photosynthesis on water potential, atmospheric CO 2  concentration ( Cg ), PAR ( Q  1 ), temperature, radius, and height: 
         
           
             Photosynthesis increases with CO 2  concentration and PAR exponentially and tends to saturate:
  (14)    A     α     (  1  −  exp  (  −    C  g    C  r    )  )    
  (15)    A     α     (  1  −  exp  (  −     Q  1      Q  r     )  )     
              Cr  and  Q   r   refers to the critical constants. 
           
           
             As a first approximation photosynthesis of each leaf decreases linearly with a reduction in soil water potential. We also suppose that water potential and hence photosynthesis decreases linearly with height (Friend,  1993 ):
  (16)     A   leaf       α        h  1   −  h     h  1       
 
             Where:
  (17)     h  1   =    (   ψ   soil    −   ψ   lim    )     R  h        
             With ψ soil  the water potential in the soil and ψ  lim   the limit water potential below which any photosynthesis cannot be performed due to a lack of turgor pressure in the leaves and increased probability of xylem cavitation.  R   h   is the hydraulic resistance per unit length. Overall for the whole canopy we suppose a dependency of the form:
  (18)    A     α     (     h  1   −  β  h     h  1     )  h     
             In particular this means that there are two antagonist effects: one that tend to increase photosynthesis with the depth of the canopy due to more leaves and another that tends to make photosynthesis decrease with height due to the decline in water potential. Note that β is a numerical coefficient that depends on the ratio between the crown depth and the height. We assumed in our simulations that β = 3/4. Also, the dependency of both height and water potential is given above. 
           
           
             We assume a dependency with temperature given by an asymmetric parabola:
  (19)    A     α     (  1  −  (    |  T  −   T   opt    |     T  i       )   2   )     
             With  T  i  being 21°C if  T  &gt;  T  opt  and 25°C otherwise. We set here  T  opt  = 18°C. These values are inspired by previous studies (e.g., Precht et al.,  1973 ). 
           
           
             We suppose that photosynthesis is proportional to the surface area of the crown, and so proportional to  r  2 . 
           
         
         Overall we get:
  (20)      A  =   A   max    (  1  −   e   −    C  g    C  r      )  (  1  −   e   −     Q  1     Q  r      )  (  1  −  (     |  T  −   T   opt    |     T  i        )   2   )                        (     h  1   −  3  h  /  4     h  1     )   r  2   h       
       
       
         2.6. Maximal meristem-sustained growth 
         Intuitively, as meristem-sustained growth occurs at a cellular level, we assume that the limit to meristem-sustained growth per volume increases with temperature up to a certain temperature and increases with water potential (cf. Deleuze and Houllier,  1998 ). Therefore, we assume the following dependencies: 
         
           
             Themeristem-sustained growth limit decreases with height as:      R   max       α       (   h  2   −  h  )     h  2       
  (21)     h  2   =    (   ψ   soil    −   ψ   lim  2    )     R  h        
             With ψ soil  the water potential in the soil and ψ lim2  the limit water potential below which meristem-sustained growth cannot occur. Physically this gives us a maximal height  h  2  due to the limit on meristematic growth. 
             We define therefore  R  max0  the reference maximal meristem-sustained growth per volume independant of water potential by:      R     m  a  x     =    R     m  a  x  0        (     h    2    -  h   )       h    2        
             We could also suppose that the limit to meristem-sustained growth per volume increases with temperature using a standard  Q  10  formulation:      R     m  a  x        α       Q    10      T  -    T    2      10       . However, seen the difficulty to know precisely  Q  10  and in order to keep the model as simple as possible we assumed that  R  max0  remains constant with time. 
           
           
             As stated previously, we suppose that the volume of meristems is expressed as:      V     m  e     =   (     t    1    π    r    2    +  2  π  r  h    t    2     )    , where  t  1  is the effective thickness of the apical meristem and  t  2  is the effective thickness of the lateral meristem. 
           
         
       
       
         2.7. Final evolution equations 
         Using the previous elements we finally get:
  (22)      d   M  c     d  t    =     R   max  0    (     h  2   −  h     h  2     )   V   me      1  +    (  S  −   S  1   )    (  1  +   S  1   )        
  (23)        d   S    c  0       d  t    =  (   A   max    (  1  −   e   −    C  g    C  r      )  (  1  −   e   −    Q  1    Q  r      )  (  1  −    (     |  T  −   T   op    |     T  i      )   2   )                              (     h  1   −  3  h  /  4     h  1     )  −  C  )  h   r  2   −   C  2   S  h   r  2   −    d   M  c     d  t        
or
  (24)        d   M  c     d  t    =  (   A   max    (  1  −   e   −    C  g    C  r      )  (  1  −   e   −     Q  1     Q  r      )  (  1  −    (     |  T  −   T   op    |     T  i      )   2   )                             (     h  1   −  3  h  /  4     h  1     )  −  C  )   r  2   h  −   C  2   S  h   r  2       
  (25)      d  S    d  t    =  0    
depending on whether carbon supply from photosynthesis plus storage is sufficient to meet demand for growth (Equations 22 and 23) or not (Equations 24 and 25). 
       
       
         2.8. Deriving the values of the parameters 
         So far we need to know the values of the following physiological parameters to use the model (Table  1 ):
     A   max    ,      g  1   ,  C  ,      C  1   ,      C  2   ,      S  1   ,     C  r  ,     Q  r  ,      h  1   ,      h  2   ,      t  2    R     max   0

         The most accessible are probably  Cr  and  Qr . These are usually well known and can be obtained from the curve of photosynthesis activity as a function of atmospheric CO 2  mixing ratio (in ppmv) or as a function of PAR, respectively. 
          A  max  can be obtained by direct measurements of the carbon exchange at a given height, ambient CO 2  concentration, temperature, PAR, and compensating for respiration as in Campioli et al. ( 2011 ). Acting similarly and measuring litter with litter traps gives access to  C . These values can also be deduced from net primary production and gross primary production and the typical litter flux rates. Note that here we use data coming from forest stands, although in the model we suppose that we have an individual tree without shading because data for lone standing trees are seldom available. This means that we may underestimate the growth of isolated trees, but at the same time the values of  A  max  and  C  obtained enable to take into account the shading effect by neighbors of a forest with the same density, which is a hidden parameter of this model (i.e., not explicitly taken into account). Also, depending on the typical time length of the study, we choose a model timestep and therefore we use averaged values of the parameters on this timestep. In this analysis, we chose 1 year as the timestep although smaller timesteps could be considered. 
         Finding  h  1  is equivalent to finding the minimal water potential that can sustain photosynthesis.  h  2  is its equivalent with respect to growth. Combined, these two parameters take into account all water potential-dependant limits in trees such as cavitation in the xylem conduits, minimal turgor potential to maintain the shape of the leaf and enable stomatal opening, etc. While  h  1  (or equivalently ψ max1 ) has been extensively studied (e.g., Friend,  1993 ; Koch et al.,  2004 ; Du et al.,  2008 ), and is believed to be equal to around 90 m for redwood trees (Koch et al.,  2004 ),  h  2  seems to be less known. However, knowing  h  1  and the other parameters, as well as the effective limit height for the considered species,  h  2  can be estimated by assuming that it is the limiting parameter in regions with very good conditions for photosynthesis. Therefore, looking at the effective limit height would give access to  h  2  for these particular regions. Using Equation (22) and regressing on the water potential we would have access to ψ  lim   and  R   h   and therefore we would be able to estimate  h  2  in any region from a measure of ψ  soil  . 
         We can find  R   max 0 , at least approximately, by looking at the tree rings of many trees across several geographical locations and assuming that the largest ones correspond to the maximal increment  dr  achievable in a year, which is directly linked to  R  max0 , the maximal meristem-sustained growth rate under perfect water potentials. Then we can deduce the value of  R  max0 , or at least its order of magnitude. 
       
     
     
       3. Results 
       The model described above is ordinary, first order, non-linear, and has no widely known explicit analytical solution in the case where 2α 2  is not an integer. Therefore, it was solved numerically by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) method (Dormand and Prince,  1980 ). Coherence both with the analytical solution in simplified cases and with other solving methods (i.e., the trapezoidal rule and numerical differentiation formula) was tested. 
       As some parameters can depend,  a priori , on the considered species, we derived the parameters explained previously for beech trees from the data provided in Campioli et al. ( 2011 ) and Zianis and Mencuccini ( 2005 ). Beech trees were chosen because of their importance in European forests, especially in Germany where they represent more than 15% of the forest and in France where they comprise 15% of the non-conifer forest. Therefore, a great number of studies have focussed on beech trees, enabling easier comparisons with our current study. 
       As the computation of the parameters is based on independent measurements that have sometimes a non-negligible margin of error, we allowed the parameters thus obtained to vary with a 20% margin to account for this error, and to allow a small adaptation of the model (as it is only a simplification of reality) by fitting them with reference measurements of a standard beech tree stand in Fabrikschleichach, Germany that we refer to as “first stand” in the following. As  R  max0  was more coarsely estimated we allowed it a variation of 50% in order to maintain the right order of magnitude. Also, as no precise data on the soil water potentials over the tested period A.D. 1870–2010 were available for these stands, we allowed a 50% variation of  h  2 , the height where meristem-sustained growth cannot occur due to cell turgor limits. We obtained then a final vector of parameters for our model using a non-linear least-square method (trust-region-reflective algorithm:  http://uk.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/equation-solving-algorithms.html ). 
       We then used our model to predict the time variation of height and volume of an average tree in other stands of beech trees. It should be emphasized that there is a substantial difference between fitting and prediction. Fitting a model to some data gives a partial understanding of the data but does not usually enable prediction for another tree or even for future data points as the fitting is done on a restricted set of measurements. Prediction, on the other hand, is much harder to achieve as it supposes the use of previously-derived parameters and environmental information (e.g., air temperature, soil moisture, CO 2  concentration, etc.) to predict the measurements. Usually most models are fitted rather than predicting as it is much harder to predict anything without any fitting, although when it works it gives much more information: a better understanding and a reliable way to deduce future measurements before they occur even for other trees (e.g., height or volume prediction). 
       On these stands the model was tested without any additional fitting. In that sense it is, at least partially, a prediction. Of course a fitting on these stands would give a better result than the (still good) results we obtain, however it is not the goal of our approach. This is the reason why in the figures, to emphasize the difference of treatment between the standard stand and the others, two labels appear: “partial fit” and “prediction.” 
       We first considered three stands of beech trees that are part of a long-term experiment on forest yield science performed by the Chair of Forest Growth and Yield Science at the Technische Universität München. The stands are in southern Germany, about 60 km from Würzburg in the heart of the Steigerwald, a richly forested hillside, near a small village named Fabrikschleichach (49.9 °N; 10.5 °E). They cover roughly 0.37 ha, are located within immediate proximity of each other (i.e., they have experienced the same environmental conditions), and differ only in silvicultural management, especially thinning with consequences for the development of stem densities during the experiment. The beech trees were planted and then measured at irregular intervals averaging 8 ± 3 (mean ± standard deviation) years from an age of 48 y in A.D. 1870 to 188 y in A.D. 2010. For each stand we considered the average height of the 100 trees with the largest stem diameter at breast height. The first stand was the reference stand used to partially fit the parameters (within the 20% margin). As the model needs initial values for both  h  0  and  r  0 , and as measurements only started at an age of 48 y, all the computations were run starting at an age of 48 y as can be seen in Figure  1 . 
       
         Figure 1 
         
            Size of the modeled tree with age at the first site (Fabrikschleichach) . Continuous curves are computed with the model while circles correspond to experimental measurements.  (A)  Represents the results of the partial fit on the reference stand.  (B,C)  Represent the results of the prediction with the parameters obtained by partial fitting. 
         
         
       
       As expected, our partially fitted model agrees well with the measurements from this stand (Figure  1A ;  R  2  = 0.924). Predictions with the model were then performed for the two other stands (Figures  1B,C ). 
       The results give a very good prediction for the second stand ( R  2  &gt; 0.925), and a small, although non-negligible, error for the third one ( R  2  = 0.89). However, this could be at least partially explained by the change in the density of trees during the 120 y due to different rates of thinning in the different stands (i.e., from 3,500 tree  ha  −1  to 200 tree  ha  −1  in the first stand, 6,400 tree  ha  −1  to 200 tree  ha  −1  in the second, and 2,400 tree  ha  −1  to 200 tree  ha  −1  in the third). Therefore, the red:far-red radiation ratio changes with time in the real forest while it was assumed constant in our model. 
       To complete the analysis by testing the model thus calibrated on another site where the conditions may be different, it was also used to predict the height of dominant trees in three other stands at a different site in the Spessart, Hain (50.0 °N; 9.3 °E), a low wooded mountain range in central Germany, located approximately 100 km from the first site where the beech trees were also planted and then measured from an age of 48 y in A.D. 1870 to 188 y in A.D. 2010 (Figure  2 ). As data were missing concerning the water potential during the growth period from A.D. 1870 to compare with the first stand, we allowed the model to adapt its value of  h  2  within 20% by keeping the calibration derived previously and fitting only this one parameter on the first of the three new stands. Then the new calibration was used to predict the heights of the three stands according to the model. To avoid the potential error induced by the different variations of the red:far-red ratios within the stands, we restrict our analysis to data when the density was lower than 1,000 tree  ha  −1  and started the simulations from these ages. As before, the predictions are in strong accordance with the observations for all three stands, with a nearly exact correspondence with the measurements ( R  2  = 0.99,  R  2  = 0.92,  R  2  = 0.99 respectively), except for the second stand. 
       
         Figure 2 
         
            Plot of the size of the tree with age at the second site (Hain) . Continuous curves are computed with the model and start when the tree density is lower than 1,000 tree ha −1 , while circles correspond to experimental measurements. Parameters for beech trees are obtained from the first site and  h  2  was allowed to vary up to 20% to compensate for the lack of data concerning water potential from A.D. 1870 on the two sites. Panels  (A–C)  represent, respectively, the results for stands 1–3. 
         
         
       
       We should note that the correspondence is very close but not exact, and that the data we have might limit the accuracy: firstly, from our equations we can see that there is a propagation of error from the initial conditions. An error on the initial height of 1 m could imply an error of the predicted height of up to 2.5 m after 50 years even if the model were perfect. Also, no data were available for the difference of water potentials between the stands on a same site, while it seems logical that for a certain density of trees, the stands with higher density will have less water available per tree. Therefore, this could induce a small error in  h  2  and  h  1  that could be corrected if we knew the average water potential during the growth period in each stand. 
       To exam the sensitivity of the model to the initial condition, we investigated how this impacts its predicting potential. Figure  3A  shows predictions by the model for the second stand of the first site (Fabrikschleichach) when we add an error on the initial condition for  r  0  between −20% and +20% (in blue) with an increment of 4%. We also show the effect of combining this error on  r  0  with a −20% error on  h  0  (in cyan) and a +20% error on  h  0  (in magenta). Experimental measurements are represented in red. In Figure  3B  we show the result of the model with a full range of error for  r  0  and  h  0  between −20% and +20% with an increment of 4%, while the experimental measurements are again represented in red. In these simulations some knowledge on the experimental measurement is still necessary as we need to known the allometric relationship  a priori . However, we could avoid this assumption by estimating it for instance using the allometric relationship of the first stand used for partial fitting. Figure  3B  would not change much: the result of this procedure is given in Figure  3C . Of course the prediction is likely to be more precise if we knew more than the single initial point. The existing but small dispersion of the model prediction due to variation in the initial condition as demonstrated by the panels in Figure  3 , is encouraging. It appears that the sensitivity or our model to the initial condition is not a significant concern regarding the ability of the model to reproduce actual behavior.

            Plot of the size of the tree with age at the second stand of the first site (Fabrikschleichach) when some error is added to the initial conditions . On every plot the error on  r  0  ranges between −20 and +20%, while the error on  h  0  depends on the plot.  (A)  Three groups of initial conditions are represented: no error on  h  0  (blue), -20% error on  h  0  (magenta), +20% error on  h  0  (cyan).  (B)  Error on  h  0  ranges between −20% (cyan) and +20% (magenta) with a 4% increment.  (C)  Same as the previous but, in addition, allometric relationship of the stand is assumed unknown. 
         
         
       
       Finally, mortality is not addressed by the model, although the model does produce cessation of growth under stressful circumstances. Therefore, tree mortality due to critical events (e.g., disturbance, pathogens, etc.) other than a limit on growth due to the external conditions, can create discontinuities in the data which are not captured by the model. Although the continual use of the 100 trees with largest DBHs tends to average this discontinuity (as the probability that a large change in those 100 trees occurs in 1 year is low), this might have created another limit to the accuracy. For instance, we note that we have observed in the 2010 measurements, i.e., after 188 years, the death of several of the 100 trees with the largest DBHs, which seems to have caused a decline of the average height of the 100 living trees with the largest DBHs as taller trees were replaced by smaller trees in this group, which is a result of size-related mortality dynamics (cf. Holzwarth et al.,  2013 ). 
       If we wanted to address further this question, especially if we wanted to simulate many individual trees that interact together in a forest, we could multiply the height  h  by a random process  M ( t ) that would be equal to 1 when the tree is alive and 0 when the tree is dead. Then the probability p(M(t) = 0|M(s&lt;t) = 1) of transition between a living tree and a dead tree could be derived using experimental measurements and even be a function of the size of the tree. So far, though, this doesn't seem to be needed in the present application. 
       So far, the only things we assumed to be known for predicting the height are the external variables (i.e., temperature, water potential, PAR, and CO 2  concentration), the species of the tree, and the allometric relationships for each stand. No other knowledge about the trees was used to perform the predictions. Measurements in themselves were used to compare our predictions with reality. 
       We chose to predict height as there is usually a relatively small error of measurement in height compared to other variables. It should be noted that the same procedure is possible taking instead the stem volume as the quantity to predict. However, the results would be less precise because they will be susceptible to cumulative measurement errors of the radius and the stem height, among other reasons, but they would still be accurate (the highest error is around 25% after 75 years) and are presented in Figure  4 . As in Figure  1 , we find again between 168 and 188 years that the effect of thinning reduces the precision and explains the apparently strange experimental values. Also, we chose to predict height instead of radius or diameter as the measurements performed on the radius were the DBH which might be different from the equivalent cylindrical diameter, especially for the 100 trees with the largest DBH, and this would have added an artificial error of measurement.

Panel  (A)  represents the partial fit on the reference stand. Panels  (B)  and  (C)  represent the results of the prediction with the parameters obtained by partial fitting. 
         
         
       
       
         3.1. Notable behavior 
         The results of this model are very encouraging and are not limited to predicting the height of dominant trees but show notable qualitative behaviors in other respects. 
         Firstly, it is known that forest stand growth dynamics have significantly changed since 1870, as shown in Pretzsch et al. ( 2014 ), and many experiments have been conducted to measure the impact of climate and CO 2  change on forests. Climate and CO 2  change also shows an impact on this individual tree model, as the model depends on external conditions such as temperature and soil moisture, as well as CO 2  concentration. For instance, using the model with a constant CO 2  concentration (from 1870) rather than the actual CO 2  concentrations gives biased results and a slower growth of trees (Figure  5 )  2  . This seems coherent with both the idea that atmospheric CO 2  had an impact on forest stand growth and that present forest stands are growing more rapidly than comparable stands before. 
         
           Figure 5 
           
              Comparison of simulations with and without increasing atmospheric CO 2  . 
           
           
         
         Also, if we consider a small tree in a forest, shaded by the canopy above, it would receive only a small amount of light. Therefore, the model would predict a very limited maximum height and the tree would remain near this height with very small growth until a big tree nearby falls. Then the light received would be higher and enough for the tree to grow taller very quickly. If the tree were very close to the dead big tree then the aperture is large enough and the tree would reach the canopy. If not, and if the tree is still significantly partially shaded compared to the rest of the trees, then its limit height would be lower than the forest height and it would reduce its growth progressively until it were close to this height. This behavior would seem to be qualitatively in accordance with reality Nagel et al. ( 2007 ), but due to a lack of data we have not been able test this quantitatively. 
         Finally, we have examined the response of our model to a wide range of maximal carbon assimilation parameter values ( A  max ) in order to investigate the conditions under which sink-limited growth dominates (Figure  6 ). Under the reference simulation, the growth of the tree was source-limited when young, but switched to being sink-limited when it reached 84 y old (this simulation is equivalent to that presented in Figure  1B , with  A  max  obtained after a partial fit on the first stand from the value in Table  1 . At low values of  A  max  (i.e., approximately &lt;80% of the reference value), the tree remained source-limited to maturity, whereas at high values it was sink-limited for most of its life. 
         
           Figure 6 
           
              Effect of maximal carbon assimilation ( A  max ) and time on simulated tree height . Also shown is the limiting process for growth: source or sink.  A  max  is normalized to 1 at its value in Table  1 . 
           
           
         
         To examine further the idea of the importance of considering the sink limit in this model we performed a similar simulation but we switched off the sink limit, letting photosynthesis being the only limiting factor. We then computed the difference of the two simulations. This difference is shown in Figure  7 . As we can see for regions where  A  max  is large, the difference in tree heights between the two simulations can reach around 40 m after several 100 years.

       4. Discussion 
       Our aim in developing this model has been to provide a means of representing realistic tree growth and forest/vegetation dynamics at the global scale. To simulate individual tree competition our preferred method is to use a gap model of succession. Our global gap-model, HYBRID (Friend and White,  2000 ), computes individual-level photosynthesis and allocates photosynthate to leaves, stems, and roots, without consideration of sink limitations. All other DGVMs do something similar (Fatichi et al.,  2014 ), usually at the big-leaf level (i.e., they do not consider individuals at all). The motivation of the new model described here is to explore a framework for introducing, in DGVMs, sink-limited growth. We have suggested as simple a scheme as possible to avoid reaching the point where we can no longer simulate dynamics at the global scale due to limited computing resources. The approach to modeling photosynthesis in DGVMs is similar to ours, in that the whole canopy is typically simulated as one leaf, and so it seems appropriate to simulate the meristems with a similar approach. We have chosen two meristem types—apical and lateral, in order to simulate the essential properties of height and diameter growth. Our new model is a major advance over current global models, and we expect that it could have significant consequences for our understanding of the historical and future global terrestrial carbon sink. 
       Our model starts from physiological considerations about trees and several hypotheses to derive differential equations that are solved over time to obtain the growth of a tree and predict its size. Although the model is fairly simple and far from taking every possible parameter of the tree into account, it seems to obtain very good results and predictions which agree closely with observations from different stands of trees with different environmental conditions. 
       Interestingly, our approach gives rise to two limiting tree heights:  h  1 , the limit height above which photosynthesis cannot occur, and  h  2 , the height above which growth is limited by the capacity of the meristematic regions themselves to grow at low water potential. These two heights represent different processes:  h  1  includes the factors that limit photosynthesis such as minimal turgor potential and possible xylem cavitation (i.e., source limitations), whereas  h  2  takes into account intrinsic meristem factors such as the physiological limits of cell division and growth limits such as cell wall extension when the water potential is too low (i.e., sink limitations). 
       While  h  1  (and, more generally, source processes) is often considered as the only limiting height to explain the maximal height of trees (e.g., Koch et al.,  2004 ), under some external conditions of light and temperature it could be that  h  2  (i.e., sink activity) becomes limiting (cf. Friend,  1993 ). Although in this model, water potential is still the critical factor which limits the height of trees, the amount of light received and the temperature during the growth period also play roles that could produce one or other limit and influence its value. Hence, our approach could give a new and more complete understanding of the limits of tree height, and growth more generally, through a balanced consideration of both source and sink limitations. 
       Concerning the derivation of the results, we could have avoided assuming known allometric relationships for each stand and tried to estimate them as described in Section 2.3 (“Control mechanism of the tree"). Another way to estimate the allometric relationship on the second and third stand could be to estimate it close to the allometric relathionship of the first stand used for partial fitting. In that case we would still get good results with  R  2  around 0.8 − 0.9. The small difference of accuracy between this case and the previous one is mainly due to the model becoming more sensitive to measurement error when we estimate the allometric relationship, and also to the estimated allometric relationship being a constant as explained in Section 2.3, whereas the allometric relationship in reality changes with changes in tree density and therefore time. Lastly, our model for α 2  is probably too simple as we also explained in Section 2.3. Nevertheless, we can note that the accuracy of the results is still very good considering that we try here to predict the heights of three stands without knowing anything but the species, the CO 2  concentration, the temperature, the soil moisture, the PAR, the number of trees per ha, and the initial tree dimensions. This last point also underscores an additional motivation to build such a relatively simple model: collecting data about the external variables can be difficult. Therefore, data can be limiting and in order to be practical the model should stay as simple as it can relative to the required data, provided that it can still give accurate results. 
       As a first dynamic model for an individual tree using such considerations about control mechanism and the maximal meristem-sustained limited rate of growth, improvements could probably be made by introducing additional parameters, especially taking the roots into account explicitly, and improving the function of the red:far-red ratio. Nevertheless, the model already gives very good results while being relatively simple, allowing its wider use such as through allowing many trees to interact with each other via shading, water potential, etc., and obtaining a model for the whole forest. So far the partial fitting of the parameters within bounds of 20% takes less than 120 s on a desk-top computer, and computing height over 100 y less than 0.1 s, which suggests that its use as a growth simulator within a forest model could be achieved with today's computer resources. 
       Our model makes the interesting prediction that under standard conditions/parameterization, trees shift from being source- to sink-limited as they mature. This behavior is consistent with field and experimental evidence for a lack of stem growth response to elevated CO 2  in mature trees, despite increased photosynthesis (e.g., Körner,  2005 ; van der Sleen et al.,  2014 ), whereas young fast growing trees show significant responses (e.g., Norby et al.,  1999 ). In our model, the cause of the change in growth limitation as trees grow appears to be a combination of the effect of the limiting height for meristem activity,  h  2 , and the dependency of the balance of photosynthesis and respiration on height. 
       The relative simplicity of the model and its extremely encouraging results should stimulate further use of similar differential models in the future. Starting from physiological considerations to derive differential equations and an individual tree model as a cornerstone for simulating a whole forest may considerably improve our understanding of forest behavior, including, but not limited to, the prediction of overall responses of forests to increasing CO 2  concentrations in order to address the future terrestrial carbon sink. 
       A number of other models have the potential to address the issues considered in this paper. For example, the L-PEACH FSPM (Allen et al.,  2005 ) contains a number of features that make it applicable to the source-sink debate, including carbohydrate storage dynamics, product inhibition of photosynthesis, a transport-resistance framework for sugar partitioning, a sink growth control from available carbon, a direct effect of water supply, and an intrinsic size limit. The pipe model constraint is used, making overall growth a strong function of leaf growth, which itself is determined by carbon supply. However, it is not clear the extent to which this model would predict either source- or sink-limitations under different environmental conditions and/or timescales. This would be a very interesting exercise. FSPMs are also relevant to the calculation of canopy red:far red ratios as they explicitly treat light interception throughout the canopy. In fact, some herbaceous crop models already compute the canopy red:far red ratio distribution and its influence on morphogenesis (e.g., Chelle et al.,  2007 ). Such approaches could be simplified for implementing dynamic red:far red ratio responses in our model. 
       To conclude, we have proposed a differential model for modeling tree growth over time under external conditions such as temperature, soil moisture, and CO 2  concentration. This model takes into account not only photosynthesis and the carbon balance but also meristem behavior and cellular growth limits. We established a procedure to parametrize the model with measurable quantities and reference measurements. This model seems not only to fit data very well but also to give accurate predictions for tree height and tree volume.

         Although the brain is composed of numerous cell types, neurons have received the vast majority of attention in the attempt to understand how this organ functions. Neurons are indeed fundamental but, in order for them to function correctly, they rely on the surrounding “non-neuronal” cells. These different cell types, which include glia, epithelial cells, pericytes, and endothelia, supply essential substances to neurons, in addition to protecting them from dangerous substances and situations. Moreover, it is now clear that non-neuronal cells can also actively participate in determining neuronal signaling outcomes. Due to the increasing problem of obesity in industrialized countries, investigation of the central control of energy balance has greatly increased in attempts to identify new therapeutic targets. This has led to interesting advances in our understanding of how appetite and systemic metabolism are modulated by non-neuronal cells. For example, not only are nutrients and hormones transported into the brain by non-neuronal cells, but these cells can also metabolize these metabolic factors, thus modifying the signals reaching the neurons. The hypothalamus is the main integrating center of incoming metabolic and hormonal signals and interprets this information in order to control appetite and systemic metabolism. Hence, the factors transported and released from surrounding non-neuronal cells will undoubtedly influence metabolic homeostasis. This review focuses on what is known to date regarding the involvement of different cell types in the transport and metabolism of nutrients and hormones in the hypothalamus. The possible involvement of non-neuronal cells, in particular glial cells, in physiopathological outcomes of poor dietary habits and excess weight gain are also discussed.

       Introduction 
       Our understanding of the neuronal circuits controlling metabolism has advanced in recent years and progress has been made in the development of potential treatments for obesity, particularly in specific monogenic forms of obesity ( 1 ). However, the brain is not composed of neurons alone; other cell types actually outnumber these electrically excitable nerve cells and participate in and/or modulate all neuronal functions. In the hypothalamus, this includes the participation of non-neuronal cells in the modulation of neuronal circuits controlling appetite and metabolism. 
       Non-neuronal cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including glia, epithelial cells, pericytes, and endothelia, perform a wide spectrum of functions throughout the brain. Many of these functions are common in each brain area, although the specific outcomes are at least in part dependent on the neuronal circuits that are affected by their actions. Moreover, within each class of non-neuronal cell type there are generalized subclassifications that, although quite incomplete, indicate diverse functional states. There are also specialized cell types found only in specific areas of the brain. One important example that will be discussed in greater detail is tanycytes, specialized glial cells found lining the third ventricle and in close proximity to the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. The fact that there is wide heterogeneity within each non-neuronal cell type has become increasingly clear; however, we currently do not have the tools available to sufficiently distinguish between these subpopulations and this has clearly hindered advances in this field. 
       With the explosion in the prevalence of obesity that has occurred almost worldwide, investigation in the area of metabolic control has become a priority. This has led to an increase in our understanding of how non-neuronal cell types participate in the neuroendocrine control of appetite and energy expenditure, as well as in the response to increased weight gain and the development of secondary complications. Here, we have briefly outlined the different types of non-neuronal brain cells and some of their functions, both in general and those that are specific to the hypothalamus and metabolic circuits. 
     
     
       Classification of Non-Neuronal Cells in the Brain 
       
         Astroglial Cells 
         Astrocytes were the first class of glial cells to be described ( 2 ) and they are also the most studied. One example of this is that a search of the word “astrocyte” in the PubMed Central database obtains approximately 48,000 results; typing “microglia” or “oligodendrocyte” receives less than 30,000 returns in either case. Astroglia are also the most abundant cell type in the CNS and were first thought to only constitute the physical and metabolic support for neuronal function ( 2 ). We now know that they are much more than just “neuron helpers” ( 3 ). Astrocytes do indeed transport nutrients and metabolic factors across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and release them to the extracellular fluid where they can be used by neurons and other glial cells ( 4 ,  5 ) (Figure  1 ). However, it is now clear that this supply of energy substrates to other cell types is regulated with astrocytes responding to metabolic changes in order to maintain brain homeostasis ( 6 – 9 ). Astrocytes are also the only glial cells known to store energy through glycogenesis ( 10 ). In the synaptic cleft, they reuptake neurotransmitters and also can release gliotransmitters, forming part of what is called the “tripartite synapse” ( 11 ,  12 ). At the level of the BBB, astrocytes are involved in the formation and maintenance of some of the barrier properties ( 13 ) and can regulate vasodilatation, thus controlling the flow of blood-borne substances ( 14 ,  15 ). 
         
           Figure 1 
           
              Schematic representation of the blood–brain barrier . Astrocytic endfeet surround the microvessels and take up the nutrients and metabolic factors coming from the bloodstream. Endothelial cells at this level express specific receptors and transporters and restrict the passage of small molecules to the brain due to the tight junctions between them. Depending on the metabolic state, nutrients and factors are processed by astrocytes to control their access to neurons and maintain brain homeostasis. 
           
           
         
         Astrocytes are connected by gap junctions in their plasma membranes, which enable direct transport of small molecules between cells. Initially, it was thought that these channels allowed passive diffusion of substances; however, the transport through gap junctions is tightly regulated ( 16 ,  17 ). One important function of these gap junctions is the rapid transmission of calcium waves within the glial network, resulting in a form of non-neuronal signal transmission ( 18 ). 
         When employing classical labeling methods, astrocytes appear to have a star-shaped morphology, although two different forms, protoplasmic and fibrous, can be distinguished. The first are mainly found close to synapses and blood vessels, whereas the latter are frequently found within the white matter ( 19 – 21 ). The morphology of these glial cells also changes in respect to their functional or activational state. The fact that astrocytes differentially express certain proteins (e.g., receptors, enzymes, channels, etc.) depending on the brain area and the physiological or pathophysiological conditions to which they are subjected raises questions regarding the current definition and classification of astroglial cells ( 22 ). Growing evidence indicates that astrocytes are vastly heterogeneous ( 23 – 28 ). For example, Matthias and colleagues reported that within the hippocampus subsets of GFAP expressing cells expressed either glutamate transporters or glutamate receptors ( 23 ). Moreover, astrocytes throughout the brain differentially express connexins ( 24 ) and GABA and glutamate receptors ( 26 ) and different astrocyte populations are reported to differentially support developmental functions and synapse formation ( 28 ,  29 ). Thus, our understanding of the functions of astrocytes is advancing, but much is yet to be learned. Indeed, we are only now beginning to have the tools to understand the grand diversity of these glial cells. 
       
       
         Microglia 
         Microglial cells constitute the bulk of the immune system in the brain. There have been different systems suggested for the classification of microglia, with most engaging morphological features. The most general classification includes an amoeboid form, characteristic of early development, and a ramified form or “resting” microglia and reactive microglia ( 30 – 32 ). The phenotype of reactive microglia is defined by changes in morphology, to short and thick projections, and the release of factors like cytokines, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species ( 30 ,  31 ,  33 ,  34 ). This “activation” or change in phenotype can occur in response to brain damage, toxic substances, or injury due to harmful conditions like obesity or a high fat diet (HFD) ( 35 ,  36 ) and when this state is sustained, it can lead to a pathological chronic state of reactive microgliosis ( 37 ). However, the division that separates resting and reactive microglia has become more diffuse as we learn more about these cells ( 38 ). 
         One of the main functions of microglia is to “clean” the CNS by phagocytosis of cellular debris, foreign matter, and other wastes ( 39 ). In this manner, they participate in development and synaptic plasticity ( 40 – 42 ). They can also release gliotransmitters and metabolic factors, contributing to maintain brain homeostasis ( 38 ,  43 ). Importantly, as part of the immune system, microglial cells respond to injury and harmful factors, including fatty acids, by releasing cytokines and to infection by presenting antigens to T-cells ( 35 ,  39 ,  43 ). 
       
       
         Oligodendrocytes 
         Oligodendrocyte projections wrap neuronal axons, forming the myelin sheaths in the CNS. To date, no direct link between these cells and systemic metabolic function has been verified, although some studies connecting metabolic signals with changes in myelination or oligodendrocyte survival suggest at least an indirect relationship with metabolism ( 44 – 48 ). However, it has been recently shown that oligodendrocyte precursors (NG2 glia) in the median eminence are important for the function of leptin receptor-expressing neurons, whose dendritic processes they contact ( 49 ). 
       
       
         Tanycytes 
         These specialized ependymal-like glial cells lining the ventral and ventrolateral part of the third ventricle (Figure  2 ) are proving to be very interesting as we know more about them. From dorsal to ventral, they are classified as subtypes α1, α2, β1, and β2. They are polarized cells: on the ventricle-side they express numerous receptors and transporters in their membrane and can be ciliated (not β2 tanycytes); and on the opposite side they present a long process that projects into the hypothalamic parenchyma or the median eminence ( 50 ). The β2 tanycytes can be found close to the median eminence, a subhypothalamic circumventricular organ. Capillaries on the median eminence are fenestrated, making the BBB permeable to many substances ( 50 – 52 ). The long processes of β2-tanycytes project into these fenestrated vessels, forming a blood–CSF barrier (BCSFB). The tight junctions between them, in addition to the specific transporters that they express, allow them to control the entry of many substances into the hypothalamus ( 53 ). They can also regulate the permeability of this barrier at this level of the brain, by the release of vascular endothelial growth factor-A in response to metabolic changes ( 54 ) and possibly by other mechanisms ( 55 ). Although astrocytes are the major cells expressing gap junctions, tanycytes also express these structures and can also produce calcium wave signaling ( 56 ). Tanycytes also possess stem cell properties ( 57 ) and participate in glutamate recycling ( 58 ), nutrient sensing ( 59 ,  60 ), and the conversion of thyroid hormones (TH) ( 61 ). 
         
           Figure 2 
           
              Schematic representation of tanycytes lining the third ventricle . Microvessels of the median eminence are fenestrated, so they allow water, ions, and small molecules to freely enter the brain. β2-tanycytes present tight junctions between them, forming a blood–CSF barrier. They take up nutrients and factors from the microvessels and control their access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the rest of the brain. This is probably the main route for some hormones and nutrients to the hypothalamus. Also, tanycytes are communicated through gap junctions, so some molecules can be transported to lateral β1 and α-tanycytes and gain access to the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. 
           
           
         
       
       
         Pericytes 
         Pericytes are contractile cells surrounding the blood vessels ( 62 ,  63 ). In addition to their ability to modify blood flow due to their contractibility, brain pericytes have multiple roles in the development and maintenance of the BBB ( 64 ,  65 ), including macrophage-like functions and characteristics ( 66 – 68 ), angiogenic properties ( 69 ), and a role in neuroinflammation ( 70 ). Indeed, in response to brain injury, there is evidence that pericytes change to a microglia-like phenotype ( 68 ,  71 ), migrate to the brain parenchyma ( 72 ), and are involved in scar formation ( 73 ), antigen presentation ( 74 ), and the release of inflammatory factors ( 75 ,  76 ). Pericytes are also reported to be multipotential stem cells in the CNS ( 77 ). However, the identity of these stem cells is still a subject of controversy ( 78 ), due to the lack of reliable pericyte markers ( 79 ). 
       
       
         Endothelial Cells 
         Endothelial cells, along with pericytes, form the walls of the microvessels, taking part in the transport of metabolites through the BBB ( 80 ). The particularities of BBB endothelial cells, described below, allow for a strict control of the passage of substances from the blood into the CNS. 
       
       
         Epithelial Cells/Ependymocytes 
         In the CNS, epithelial cells can be found in the choroid plexus and lining the ventricles. They secrete the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that fills the ventricles and factors involved in neurogenesis and brain development ( 81 – 84 ). Epithelial cells of the CNS also express transporters for glucose, amino acids, and other molecules ( 85 – 87 ), as well as receptors for hormones such as sex steroids ( 88 – 90 ) and leptin ( 91 ). Moreover, they form a type of BCSFB due to the tight junctions between them ( 92 ). Ependymal cells are epithelial cells lining the ventricles. Their polarized organization and beating of numerous cilia are important for the movement of CSF ( 93 ,  94 ). They also possess precursor properties and, together with tanycytes, form the hypothalamic neurogenic niche ( 95 ). 
       
     
     
       Functions of Non-Neuronal Cells 
       
         Transport of Metabolic Signals into and within the Hypothalamus 
         The transport of nutrients and other metabolic signals is one of the best studied functions of non-neuronal cells in the nervous system. At the physiological level, nutrients from the diet, hormones, and other substances are delivered to all tissues through the bloodstream. However, due to its exceptional importance and vulnerability, the CNS protects its homeostasis by carefully controlling what can and cannot enter from the circulation. This function is carried out by the BBB, which is formed by specialized glia, pericytes, and endothelial cells expressing transporters, receptors, and sensors that allow them to select the information and nutrients accessing the nervous tissue ( 80 ) (Figure  1 ). As nutrients and metabolic signals are also found in the CSF, there is a BCSFB, formed by ependymal cells and tanycytes, in the third ventricle ( 50 ,  96 ,  97 ) (Figure  2 ). The distribution of tight junction proteins between tanycytes at this level is important in determining the permeability of the barrier, being lower at the median eminence, where there are fenestrated capillaries and higher next to the arcuate nucleus ( 98 ). 
         The first checkpoint for any substance to cross the BBB into the CNS is the endothelial cell, the bricks forming the capillary walls (Figure  1 ). Endothelial cells in the BBB are phenotypically different from those of peripheral vessels and restrict the access of blood-borne substances to the extracellular fluid of the CNS ( 80 ,  99 ). To achieve this, these endothelial cells have tight junctions between them, reduced endocytosis, no fenestrations, and specific transporters and receptors, in addition to a large number of mitochondria ( 65 ). Thus, brain capillary endothelial cells broadly determine the barrier permeability. Surrounding these capillaries are the astrocytic endfeet, along with pericytes and microglia (Figure  1 ). These other cells also participate in the regulation of nutrient and hormone entry, and thus metabolic signaling, from the periphery ( 80 ,  99 ,  100 ). Astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells can detect changes in the concentrations of specific nutrients and the presence of other signals and react consequently to maintain brain homeostasis, as described below. 
         
           Glucose 
           Glucose, the main energy source of the CNS, enters the brain from the bloodstream crossing the BBB through specific transporters. As normal brain function depends on its glucose supply, this step is highly regulated. That is, the transport of glucose across the BBB adapts in response to cerebral energy demand in order to maintain glucose homeostasis in the brain. The facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 is largely responsible for glucose transport across the BBB. This protein is expressed in non-neuronal cells throughout the CNS, especially in astrocytes and endothelial cells of the BBB ( 101 ), as well as in tanycytes along the BCSFB ( 50 ). However, GLUT-1 in endothelial cells is highly glycosylated, having a higher molecular weight than the isoform expressed in astrocytes and other glial cells ( 101 ,  102 ). As indicated in a recent review, some authors suggest different functional characteristics between the two forms of GLUT-1, although there is no consensus on this subject ( 103 ). 
           Changes in glucose concentration are rapidly detected in the hypothalamus, which adapts to such variations and emits a response to maintain glucose homeostasis not only in the brain, but also systemically as glucose-sensing neurons in the hypothalamus send signals to the autonomous nervous system, reaching peripheral organs such as the pancreas or the liver ( 104 – 107 ). There is more than one mechanism for central glucose sensing and different cell types are involved in this essential task ( 107 – 110 ). Two populations of glucose-sensing neurons have been identified: glucose-excited and glucose-inhibited neurons (GE and GI, respectively) ( 111 ) and glial cells also participate in these important glucose-sensing mechanisms. Astrocyte endfeet express GLUT-2 which, in addition to its transport functions, participates in glucose sensing ( 110 ,  112 ). This GLUT is highly expressed in tanycytes along the BCSFB ( 109 ), with these specialized glial cells also participating in glucose-sensing processes. In addition to expressing GLUT-2, astrocytes and tanycytes express sodium glucose transporter (SGLT)-1, glucokinase (GCK), and K ATP  channels ( 110 ), proteins that are all known to be involved in glucose-sensing mechanisms. Indeed, the classical mechanism for glucose sensing in pancreatic β-cells requires glucose uptake through GLUT-2 in rodents or GLUT-1 in humans, GCK, and activation of ATP-sensitive K +  channels ( 112 ,  113 ). This system shares some similarities with glucose-sensing pathways in astrocytes and tanycytes. 
           One proposed model for glucose sensing in tanycytes involves glucose entering the cell through GLUT-2 and phosphorylation by GCK. Subsequently, glucose-6-phosphate undergoes glycolysis, producing pyruvate and, through the action of lactate dehydrogenase, lactate. Lactate is transported to the extracellular space by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-4 or MCT-1, and then taken up by neurons through MCT-2 ( 109 ). Depending on the kind of neuron, GE or GI, an excitatory or inhibitory signal will be produced in the hypothalamus and sent to other brain areas and the autonomic nervous system ( 108 ). Tanycytes can also respond rapidly to glucose and other inputs by producing calcium waves, a process requiring ATP release and autocrine signaling through purinergic P2Y receptors ( 56 ,  59 ). The precise mechanisms involved in this tanycytic response are not yet fully elucidated, but it constitutes a possible model for tanycyte–neuron interaction. 
           Glucose sensing in astrocytes involves a similar process. Indeed, according to the “astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle” hypothesis proposed by Pellerin and Magistretti over two decades ago ( 4 ), lactate from glucose or glycogen metabolism released by astrocytes is not only used by neurons as an energy source but can also signal energy availability to glucose-sensing neurons. Glucose transport into astrocytes is facilitated by GLUT-2 or occurs through gap junctions in a passive manner ( 112 ,  114 – 116 ). This glucose can be metabolized or stored as glycogen. However, it is still debated as to whether astrocytes secrete only lactate or also glucose to the extracellular fluid to act on glucose-sensing neurons and to be used as fuel ( 112 ). Moreover, astrocytes and tanycytes can respond to an increase in glucose or to other signals (i.e., some neurotransmitters) by secreting endozepines, anorexigenic peptides that act on hypothalamic neurons to maintain energy homeostasis ( 107 ,  117 ) and that also participate in unsaturated long-chain fatty acid metabolism in astrocytes ( 118 ). 
           The precise mechanisms of glucose transport and sensing in the hypothalamus are yet to be fully elucidated. For example, SGLT, an active sodium co-transporter, is reported to be involved in glucose sensing in the ventromedial nucleus of the rodent hypothalamus ( 119 ), although it is not clear whether this sensing occurs in glucose responsive neurons or in astrocytes. By using genetically engineered mouse models, García-Cáceres and collaborators recently demonstrated that insulin signaling in astrocytes plays a role in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis. Specific ablation of the insulin receptor (IR) in astrocytes was shown to impair their uptake of glucose and the ability to correctly respond to changes in glycemia ( 120 ). Other studies suggest a role of leptin in increasing ( 121 ) or ghrelin in reducing ( 122 ) glucose uptake by astrocytes, which might also affect glucose sensing. It thus appears that the transport of glucose by astrocytes is highly regulated by diverse nutrient and hormonal signals. 
         
         
           Ketone Bodies 
           Monocarboxylates are molecules with one carboxylate group; some examples with metabolic functions include not only lactate, but also pyruvate and ketones, all of which can be used by neurons as an alternative energy source in addition to acting as metabolic signals ( 123 – 126 ). The brain expresses MCTs-1, -2, and -4, with MCT-1 being found in endothelial and ependymal cells, as well as in astrocyte endfeet at the BBB ( 127 ,  128 ). MCT-2 is expressed in endothelial cells, but not in astrocytes, whereas MCT-4 appears to be specific for astrocytes ( 58 ,  129 – 131 ). Ketone bodies and other monocarboxylates from the bloodstream cross the BBB through specific MCTs present in both the luminal and abluminal sides of the endothelial cells ( 132 ,  133 ). Astrocyte endfeet not only takes up monocarboxylates through MCT-1 ( 132 – 134 ), but these glial cells are also able to synthesize ketone bodies from fatty acid β-oxidation and secrete them as an energy source for neurons and other glial cells (Figure  1 ). Tanycytes have also been suggested to transport lactate through MCT-2 in a photoperiodic model of Siberian hamster ( 58 ). These authors found that MCT-2 and the glutamate transporter GLAST were decreased during a short photoperiod, which could indicate a change in seasonal neurotransporter supply. In the rat brain, tanycytes were shown to express functional MCT-1 and MCT-4 in an anatomically specific manner ( 135 ), suggesting that these glial cells may also participate in lactate transport to neurons. 
           Regulation of the transport and production of ketone bodies in the brain is important in metabolic control as hypothalamic sensing of these monocarboxylates also participates in the regulation of food intake ( 126 ,  136 ). Indeed, after the initial HFD-induced hyperphagia, there is a reduction in food intake that is reported to be mediated, at least in part, by ketone body signaling to hypothalamic neurons. These ketone bodies are synthesized by hypothalamic astrocytes as products of fatty acid metabolism ( 136 ,  137 ). 
         
         
           Lipids 
           Lipid sensing in the hypothalamus is necessary for the correct regulation of energy balance ( 138 ). There are lipid sensing neurons that are excited or inhibited by fatty acids, depending on the type of neuron and also the metabolic state, i.e., fasting versus overfeeding ( 139 ). Although the role of glial cells in this process is not fully understood, astrocytes are the primary lipid metabolizers in the CNS. They also express proteins related to lipid sensing, such as transporter CD36 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, an important lipid-activated nuclear receptor that regulates transcription of numerous genes, including some involved in lipid metabolism ( 140 ,  141 ). In addition, astrocytic production of ketone bodies from fatty acids and their release to neurons could be one way by which an excess of fatty acids is signaled to metabolic neuronal circuits. Recent evidence suggests an increase in fatty acid β-oxidation in hypothalamic astrocytes from obese mice fed a HFD, as well as a role for tanycytes in restricting the passage of saturated fatty acids into the hypothalamus ( 142 ). 
           Although the brain produces lipids, it also has mechanisms to transport them from the bloodstream, but how they go through the BBB is not yet fully understood. Short and medium chain fatty acids appear to enter the CNS by simple diffusion through the plasma membrane ( 143 ). In contrast, long chain fatty acids (&gt;12 carbons) need transporters to cross the BBB ( 144 ), with several fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) having been identified ( 145 ).  In vitro  studies indicate that FATP-1, FATP-4, and FABP-5 are the major isoforms expressed in microvessel endothelial cells and the gray matter of the human brain ( 145 ,  146 ). When the fatty acid translocase (FAT) CD36 is knocked-out in mice (CD36−/−), the uptake of monounsaturated fatty acids is significantly decreased, with no effect on polyunsaturated fatty acid uptake ( 147 ). In the CNS, CD36 is expressed in endothelial cells, microglial cells, astrocytes, and in ventromedial hypothalamic neurons ( 148 – 151 ). Although it is not the most highly expressed FATP, studies indicate that CD36 is responsible for fatty acid sensing in the hypothalamus and is thus important for the control of energy homeostasis ( 136 ,  137 ,  152 ). 
           In addition to the passage of free fatty acids through the BBB, lipids can also enter or exit the CNS as lipoproteins. This process is mediated by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) interacting with lipoprotein receptors ( 153 ). In the CNS, ApoE is expressed in astrocytes and tanycytes and its levels are upregulated by both leptin and TH ( 154 ,  155 ), with this process being involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance ( 156 ). 
         
       
       
         Hormone Transport and Signaling 
         
           Leptin 
           Leptin is an anorexigenic hormone that exerts part of its effects by inhibiting orexigenic neurons and activating anorexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus ( 157 – 159 ). It also has a role in the regulation of systemic lipid and glucose metabolism ( 160 ,  161 ). The leptin (or obesity) receptor (ObR), which has six isoforms, is highly expressed in brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and tanycytes ( 162 – 165 ), and endothelial and astroglial cells have been studied in attempt to unravel the mechanisms of leptin transport into the brain ( 163 ,  166 ). However, González-Carter and colleagues have recently reported that, in a human  in vitro  BBB model, leptin–ObR interaction is not necessary for the transport of this hormone across the BBB. They propose that lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2, expressed in endothelial cells at the BBB, is responsible for the passage of leptin across the BBB ( 167 ). Increasing evidence points to the BCSFB as the main pathway for entry of leptin into, at least, the hypothalamus ( 165 ,  168 ) (Figure  2 ). 
           The median eminence, a circumventricular organ close to the third ventricle, is the first site in the brain reached by blood-borne leptin ( 165 ). After an intraperitoneal leptin injection, there is a 1–2 h lag between the activation of leptin signaling pathways in the ventral and dorsal nuclei of the hypothalamus. This time-lag disappears when leptin is administered intracerebroventricularly, instead of intraperitoneally ( 169 ), suggesting that leptin transport from blood to the CSF is an important step in the action of this hormone in the brain and that it involves a delay in circulating changes reaching central target sites. Moreover, this process appears to be a finely regulated step in the control of energy balance as tanycytes act as “gatekeepers” for the passage of leptin into the mediobasal hypothalamus. Evidence suggests that leptin is first taken up by tanycyte processes in contact with the fenestrated capillaries at the median eminence ( 165 ) and that this uptake requires the activation of ObRb and the internalization of leptin by clathrin-coated vesicles ( 165 ). According to research carried out by Vincent Prevot and his team, this process involves signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, but is janus kinase-2 independent ( 165 ). Leptin is then transported toward the tanycyte cell body and, finally, released to the CSF and hypothalamic parenchyma (Figure  2 ) employing an ERK-dependent pathway ( 165 ). By using STAT-3 phosphorylation as an indicator of leptin signaling ( 170 – 172 ), Balland and collaborators reported that neutralization of leptin in the CSF impairs leptin signaling in mediobasal hypothalamic neurons ( 165 ), supporting the idea of the blood–CSF–hypothalamic gateway for leptin entry into the brain. 
           Taking into account the above mentioned studies, it appears that both endothelial cells and tanycytes contribute to the transport of leptin through the BBB and between different brain regions ( 163 ,  166 ,  167 ). In contrast, there is no clear evidence of the involvement of astrocytes in leptin transport, but a number of studies demonstrate that leptin signaling in astrocytes is important for energy homeostasis ( 173 ,  174 ). 
           Leptin transport into the brain is modulated by conditions including obesity and fasting, as well as metabolic factors. Obesity associated to HFD intake is reported to induce central leptin resistance. There are two main mechanisms or levels of leptin resistance suggested to occur: impairment of leptin transport into the brain ( 165 ) and reduction in the central response to leptin ( 175 ). Mice exposed long term to a HFD develop leptin resistance only when high levels of plasma leptin are reached ( 176 ). This suggests that hyperleptinemia is at least one of the causes of diet-induced leptin resistance. In addition, hypothalamic inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity could contribute to leptin resistance by altering the cellular networks and molecular pathways that control energy homeostasis ( 177 ). Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that leptin resistance does not imply a loss of responsiveness to endogenous leptin, but rather that there is a threshold above which exogenous leptin barely increases the response to leptin ( 178 ,  179 ). Glucose and insulin are reported to increase the transport of leptin across the BBB ( 180 ), while an increase in circulating triglycerides could impair leptin transport across the BBB ( 181 ). The latter suggests a possible mechanism for the reported reduction in leptin transport into the brain during fasting ( 182 ). 
         
         
           Ghrelin 
           Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced and secreted in the stomach ( 183 ). It has similar targets as leptin in the CNS and also plays an important, but opposite, role in energy balance ( 184 ). There are two forms of ghrelin, acylated and unacylated, depending on the post-translational acylation with octanoic or decanoic acid ( 183 ,  185 ). This modification occurs mainly in the stomach, but there is evidence that it can also take place in target tissues ( 186 ). The acylated form of ghrelin exerts the majority of the metabolic effects of this hormone in the CNS and it binds more efficiently to the ghrelin receptor than the unacylated form ( 187 ). This receptor, also called the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a, is widely expressed in the hypothalamus ( 188 ). The mechanism underlying the passage of ghrelin across the BBB is not yet fully understood, but recent studies indicate that ghrelin possibly uses a similar route as leptin into the brain ( 189 ), i.e., through tanycytes in contact with the median eminence (Figure  2 ). Other studies indicate that this process is carried out by saturable transporters, at least for the acylated form, whereas transport of des-acyl ghrelin is not saturable ( 190 ). Entry of acylated ghrelin into the CNS is increased by serum triglycerides and fasting and is decreased in obese mice ( 191 ), in contrast with leptin transport. Diet-induced obesity is reported to impair the hypothalamic response to peripherally or centrally administered ghrelin ( 192 ). The role of unacylated ghrelin on metabolism is largely unknown, but an increasing number of studies reveal that des-acyl ghrelin has similar and opposite functions as the acylated form ( 193 – 196 ). 
         
         
           Insulin 
           Insulin is a pancreatic hormone directly involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. Within the brain, it acts to increase energy expenditure and reduce food intake and energy storage ( 197 ). Insulin binds to its receptor in the plasma membranes of endothelial cells at the BBB and is internalized following a saturable pathway ( 198 ,  199 ). Recent studies have shown that IRs in astrocytes are involved in the entry of this hormone into the CNS ( 120 ). Also, as mentioned above, insulin signaling in astrocytes is necessary for the regulation of systemic glucose levels ( 120 ). Insulin transport into the brain is enhanced by satiation hormones like cholecystokinin ( 200 ). Although estradiol is known to impair insulin’s actions in the brain, its effects appear to be unrelated to insulin transport ( 201 ). Some studies show that leptin increases insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus at the molecular level ( 202 ), while others have found that leptin impairs insulin signaling in the brain ( 203 ). This discrepancy could be a matter of the experimental model employed, but further research is needed to understand the relationship between the effects of leptin and insulin at the level of the CNS. Leptin shares some signaling pathways with insulin, but the effects of these two hormones are not entirely parallel, as they exert opposite effects in some hypothalamic neurons ( 204 ). Saturated fatty acids induce insulin resistance in the hypothalamus ( 205 ), as has been previously described in peripheral tissues ( 206 ). 
         
         
           Sex Steroids 
           As hydrophobic molecules, estrogens, androgens, and progesterone can enter the brain by simple diffusion ( 207 ). Moreover, steroids are synthesized in the brain ( 208 ). These neurosteroids are produced in the CNS either from brain-borne cholesterol or from peripherally synthesized steroid precursors, like pregnenolone, deoxycorticosterone, and testosterone ( 209 ). The enzymes necessary for this synthesis are found in non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, tanycytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes ( 210 ,  211 ), and in some neurons ( 212 ). As steroid hormones are known to regulate neurosteroid metabolism in glial cells ( 213 – 217 ) and also the expression levels of steroid receptors in the hypothalamus ( 218 ,  219 ), neurosteroids could have paracrine/autocrine functions within the brain. 
           Steroids and neurosteroids exert neuroprotective effects in the brain following brain injury, neurological disease, or inflammation ( 220 – 227 ). The expression of aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of testosterone into estradiol, is stimulated in reactive astrocytes after brain injury as a neuroprotective measure ( 228 – 230 ). Both microglial cells and astrocytes play an important role in the neuroprotective functions of steroids ( 231 ), as sex steroids diminish microglia reactivity ( 232 – 234 ) and astrocyte production of proinflammatory molecules ( 235 – 238 ). 
           Sex steroids, but specially estrogens, modulate energy homeostasis at the hypothalamic level decreasing food intake ( 239 – 241 ), increasing energy expenditure ( 242 ), and modulating the sensitivity to other metabolic hormones ( 243 ,  244 ). Their effect differs depending on the neuronal population ( 245 ,  246 ), but with an overall anorectic effect ( 247 – 249 ), although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. While nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) are involved, especially ER α ( 247 ,  250 – 252 ), evidence indicates that estrogen responsive G-coupled membrane receptors can also regulate these effects ( 253 ,  254 ). The apparently contradictory results in the literature regarding the mechanism of action of estrogens on metabolism indicate a complex system for estrogens’ function in energy homeostasis, where the different ERs could be acting in combination ( 255 ). Moreover, the mechanisms of action used by estrogens in metabolic control could be sexually dimorphic ( 256 ). The involvement of neurosteroids in energy homeostasis remains unknown. 
         
         
           Thyroid Hormones 
           The role of TH in increasing the metabolic rate has been known for more than a century ( 257 ). The involvement of these hormones in the control of energy homeostasis at the central level is a more recent discovery ( 258 ,  259 ). They promote lipogenesis at the level of the hypothalamus, which eventually leads to brown adipose tissue thermogenesis ( 259 ) and blockage of TH signaling in the hypothalamus reverts this process, leading to weight gain without an increase in feeding ( 259 ). Clinical studies and animal models with a pathological excess of TH synthesis and secretion (hyperthyroidism) have shed light on TH action in the hypothalamus and control of energy balance ( 260 ). Most hyperthyroid patients have an increased appetite and food intake and decreased body weight ( 261 ). Moreover, these same symptoms that are observed in animal models of hyperthyroidism are associated with the upregulation of orexigenic neuropeptides AgRP and NPY and downregulation of anorexigenic neuropeptides derived from POMC in the arcuate nucleus ( 259 ). There is evidence that TH are involved in brain inflammation, promoting survival, and processes growth in microglial cells and also in astrocytes ( 262 – 264 ). TH are also involved in systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensing ( 265 ,  266 ). 
           The thyroid gland produces and secretes mainly tetraiodo- l -thyronine or thyroxine (T4), which is generally transformed into triiodo- l -thyronine (T3) through deiodination at the level of peripheral tissues ( 267 ). Thus, deiodinase enzyme expression in peripheral tissues is important for the control of TH actions ( 268 ), as they catalyze the transformation of T4 into T3 and of both hormones into reverse T3 (rT3) and 3,5-diiodo- l -thyronine (T2), respectively ( 269 ). These two last forms are usually considered inactive, although in the last few years new roles have been proposed for them and other non-classical TH ( 270 ). 
           Thyroid hormones enter the hypothalamus mainly through MCT-8 ( 271 ) and organic anion transporting polypeptide-1C1 ( 272 ) in rodents ( 273 ). These transporters are expressed in endothelial cells of the BBB and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus ( 274 ), besides neurons and glial cells of the hypothalamus ( 275 – 277 ). Tanycytes act as gatekeepers for TH at the BBB ( 61 ) (Figure  2 ). These cells express the enzyme deiodinase II (DII) ( 278 – 280 ), catalyzing the formation of hormone T3 from the prohormone T4. Tanycytes uptake T4 from the capillaries and release T3 to the extracellular space in the hypothalamus, where this hormone can exert its central actions ( 258 ,  259 ,  281 ) (Figure  2 ). Modulation of deiodinase expression is a key point in TH homeostasis. For example, DII expression in tanycytes is promoted in fasting conditions ( 282 ). DII-expressing tanycytes are in direct contact with AgRP/NPY-expressing neurons of the arcuate nucleus. Upregulation of DII results in an increased production of T3, which activates AgRP/NPY neurons and, therefore, feeding behavior ( 283 ,  284 ). Tanycytes also express deiodinase III (DIII), which deiodinates T4 into reverse T3 which is biologically inactive, and T3 into T2. TH is important in the adaptation to different photoperiods in seasonal animals were, for example, there is a decrease in food intake and body weight during short photoperiods. The study of hypothalamic metabolism of TH during photoperiodic changes in seasonal mammals has shown that the there is an upregulation of DII during periods of long days, which would increase the levels of T3. In Siberian hamsters an upregulation of DIII in tanycytes has been shown to occur during short photoperiods, lowering active T3 levels ( 285 ). The retinoic acid pathway in tanycytes appears to be similarly regulated by photoperiodicity and also leads to modifications in energy expenditure ( 286 ,  287 ). 
           Thyroid hormone signaling usually occurs through nuclear thyroid receptors α and β ( 288 ) that function as transcription factors modulating gene expression ( 289 ). TH can also exert rapid non-genomic actions through membrane-associated receptors ( 290 ,  291 ). This signaling pathway could mediate TH effects on vasodilatation ( 292 ) and has been shown to be involved in neuronal excitability in the hippocampus ( 293 ,  294 ). 
           Centrally, THs control their own homeostasis in various ways, with non-neuronal cells having an important role, i.e., regulation of deiodinase expression ( 278 ) and inactivation of thyroid releasing hormone ( 295 ). Other hormones involved in metabolic control can enhance the secretion, synthesis, or sensing of TH, including leptin ( 296 – 298 ) and sex steroids ( 299 – 301 ). 
         
       
       
         Metabolism of Nutrients 
         
           Glucose 
           Perivascular astrocytes take-up blood-borne glucose that then undergoes glycolysis or glycogenesis ( 112 ). Lactate produced from glucose or glycogen metabolism in these cells is released to the extracellular space and enters neurons to be used as energy, constituting their primary energy source as suggested by some studies ( 302 ,  303 ). However, the question about the identity of the main energy source for neurons—lactate or glucose—is still debated. Tanycytes can metabolize and sense glucose in a similar manner ( 109 ). 
           Glucose storage as glycogen in astrocytes provides a way to guarantee energy release to neurons when it is needed, i.e., when faced with a raise in neuronal activity ( 304 ), by production of lactate from glycogenolysis. Several factors can regulate glycogen production and utilization in astrocytes, with insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 ( 305 ,  306 ), and leptin ( 203 ,  307 ) increasing their production of glycogen. More recently, ghrelin has been reported to possibly promote glycogenolysis in hypothalamic neurons ( 122 ). 
         
         
           Lipids and Ketone Bodies 
           It has been suggested that some fatty acids, like erucic acid ( 308 ,  309 ), suffer metabolic changes as they cross the BBB, whereas others do not ( 310 ,  311 ). Studies indicate that lipoproteins are hydrolyzed as they cross the BBB by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase associated to the membrane of endothelial cells ( 312 – 316 ). 
           In the absence of glucose and when glycogen stores are exhausted, such as in fasting conditions, astrocytes increase their uptake and utilization of fatty acids ( 136 ,  317 ,  318 ), which enter the mitochondria through carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 to undergo β-oxidation ( 319 ). In the mitochondria, the enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase and lyase ( 320 – 322 ) transform fatty acids into β-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body ( 323 ). Ketone bodies produced from this metabolic pathway are used by astrocytes themselves for fuel or secreted to be used by neurons and other glial cells ( 318 ). 
         
       
       
         Neurogenesis 
         Glial cells were first reported to participate in neurogenesis during development ( 324 – 326 ), but it later became apparent that they are also involved in this process in adulthood ( 327 ). In the developing hypothalamus of the rat, the birth of metabolically important neurons occurs between embryonic days 10.5 and 18.5 ( 328 – 330 ). Environmental changes during this period, including nutritional and hormonal disturbances, can modulate the normal process of hypothalamic neurogenesis and have an impact on later neuroendocrine function ( 330 – 332 ). For example, HFD intake by pregnant dams stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of orexigenic neuronal precursors and increases the density of orexigenic neurons at the level of the paraventricular nucleus in the offspring. This increase in the number and density of appetite-stimulating neurons and orexigenic neuropeptide expression leads to increased appetite, body weight, and propensity to develop obesity later in life ( 331 ). 
         The clear demonstration, as well as its acceptance by the scientific community, of neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamus is relatively recent and there is still much to be learned. Tanycytes form part of the pool of neuroprogenitor cells in the hypothalamus and these precursors are capable of differentiating into not only neurons, but also astrocytes both during development and in the adult brain ( 333 ,  334 ). These specialized glial cells form an important neurogenic niche in the vicinity of the median eminence ( 333 ) and can proliferate and differentiate under basal conditions and when stimulated by growth factors such as IGF-1 ( 57 ,  95 ), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 ( 335 ), FGF-10 ( 336 ,  337 ), or even vitamins, as tanycytes have been shown to express receptors, transporters, and other components of the vitamin A and C pathways ( 286 ,  287 ,  334 ,  338 ). FGF-10 positive tanycytes are reported to be important neural progenitors for NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus, a function that may continue even during adulthood ( 337 ,  339 ). In addition, other isoforms of FGF are known to play a role in glucose homeostasis, inhibition of food intake, and body weight ( 340 – 343 ), with a possible involvement of glial cells ( 344 – 347 ). Although the generation of newborn neurons in the postnatal hypothalamus takes place at lower rates than during the embryonic period, it is physiologically relevant and has been shown to be regulated by diverse factors, including hormones and growth factors such as estradiol ( 332 ), FGF ( 335 ), and IGF-1 ( 348 ). Moreover, the nutritional status and dietary intake of an individual can modulate neurogenesis in hypothalamic metabolic circuits even in the adult animal ( 329 ,  333 ,  349 – 351 ). 
         The neurons composing the hypothalamic metabolic circuits experience a turnover rate such that approximately half of these cells are reported to be replaced between 4 and 12 weeks of age in mice ( 329 ). Diet-induced obesity suppresses this remodeling, at least in part, due to a decrease in actively proliferating cells in the hypothalamus with caloric restriction reversing this effect ( 329 ). Voluntary exercise is also reported to induce hypothalamic neurogenesis ( 352 ,  353 ). The effect of nutrient intake on the adult hypothalamus may be anatomically specific, as diets rich in fat are reported to inhibit neurogenesis in the mediobasal hypothalamic parenchyma ( 333 ), but to promote it in the median eminence in female mice ( 333 ). The enhanced neurogenesis that occurs at the level of the median eminence is suggested to be involved in the restoration of neurons that are damaged as a consequence of HFD intake ( 333 ); hence, impedance of this process could amplify the derogatory effects of poor dietary habits. There is tantalizing data indicating that hypothalamic neurogenesis in response to HFD differs between males and females ( 332 ,  333 ,  354 ), but whether this is involved in the sexually dimorphic metabolic response to HFD and weight gain requires further investigation. 
         Astrocytes are involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, proliferation, and synaptogenesis during development ( 3 ,  355 ). Microglia also actively participate in neurogenesis, both during development and adulthood, with most studies being performed in the hippocampus ( 356 ). Microglia not only phagocytize cells undergoing apoptosis in proliferative zones, but they also produce factors that can either inhibit or stimulate neuroprogenitor cells. The cross-talk between microglia and neuroprogenitor cells is an active area of investigation as this is a finely tuned process where these cells continuously interchange information ( 356 ). However, less is known regarding the role of astrocytes and microglia in neurogenesis in metabolic circuits of the adult animal. 
         Diet not only affects neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, but also in other brain areas such as the hippocampus, an area known to maintain active neurogenesis even in the adult ( 357 ). In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, HFD intake impairs neurogenesis ( 358 ) in addition to producing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation ( 357 ). Palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty acid that is a major component of the majority of HFDs, was shown to reduce the proliferation of the neuroprogenitor cells ( 359 ) and the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, indicating that PA-rich diets impair neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Caloric restriction and exercise increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus ( 350 ,  360 ,  361 ) and this has been associated with the anti-depressive effects of exercise ( 360 ). 
       
       
         Synaptogenesis, Synaptic Plasticity, and Synaptic Transmission 
         Astrocytes, in addition to participating in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, also regulate synaptogenesis during development ( 3 ,  355 ). In the hypothalamus, the neonatal and early prenatal hormonal and nutritional environments can affect the synaptic connectivity of metabolic circuits ( 189 ,  362 ). Astroglial coverage of neuronal cell surfaces has been shown to be inversely correlated with the number of synaptic inputs to their somas, with this astroglial ensheathment/synaptic input arrangement being physiologically relevant in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus ( 363 – 367 ). Thus, changes in astrocyte numbers or morphology in the hypothalamus might be expected to modify synaptic inputs both during development and in later life. 
         The generation and maturation of astrocytes is not fully complete until the third postnatal week in rodents ( 368 ,  369 ), so variations in the physiological levels of specific metabolic hormones or signals during early life could affect the development of these cells. For example, neonatal overnutrition and modifications in leptin levels or signaling affect the number and morphology of astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus in adulthood ( 121 ,  173 ,  370 ). The leptin peak that takes place between postnatal days 5 and 13 in rodents is essential not only for neuronal outgrowth and maturation, but also astrogenesis ( 368 ,  371 ,  372 ) and astrocyte development ( 373 ,  374 ). The timing and magnitude of this leptin surge can be modified by nutrition ( 371 ,  375 ,  376 ), as well as other conditions such as stress ( 377 ) and is one mechanism by which these early environmental influences can have long-term effects on metabolism. 
         Maternal dietary intake and body weight during gestation and lactation can also influence metabolic circuit formation in the offspring, including the astroglial ensheathment/synaptic input arrangement. For example, newborns from mothers fed a HFD during gestation and lactation have increased astroglial ensheathment of POMC neurons that is associated with a decrease in the resting mini inhibitory post synaptic currents of these neurons ( 121 ). The response of these POMC neurons to changes in glucose concentrations was also shown to be modified ( 121 ). Hence, alterations in the early nutritional environment could imply the modification of the appropriate development of neuron–glial interaction of metabolic circuits and therefore affect long-term metabolism. 
         Microglia are involved in synaptogenesis throughout the brain ( 378 ,  379 ); however, there is little information regarding the specific effects of microglia on the development of the synaptic interactions of metabolic circuits. These glial cells have been shown to have an active role in the sexual differentiation of behavior and masculinization of the brain ( 380 ), suggesting that they may indeed be important for the development of endocrine circuits and possibly the sexual differentiation of some of these systems. 
         Modifications in the synaptic connectivity of metabolic circuits occur in postnatal life in response to metabolic and hormonal signals ( 241 ,  381 – 384 ) and are most likely involved in the adaptation to changes in energy inputs/conditions in attempt to maintain metabolic homeostasis, with astroglia participating in these synaptic rearrangements. HFD induced-obesity is associated with an increase in the glial coverage of both POMC and NPY cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus, which is coincident with a decrease in the number of synaptic inputs to the perikarya of these neurons ( 384 ). However, there is a decline in stimulatory inputs to NPY neurons and of inhibitory inputs to POMC neurons ( 384 ), which would result in an overall decline in orexigenic signaling. When first given a HFD, rodents experience a phase of hyperphagia that is normally followed by an attenuation of this rise in energy intake. The levels of polysialic acid (PSA) are rapidly increased in the arcuate nucleus in response to HFD ( 385 ). This cell-surface glycogen can attach to cell membrane proteins to weaken cell–cell interactions and facilitate synaptic reorganization ( 386 ). If PSA is enzymatically removed from neural-cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the hypothalamus, HFD induced modifications in metabolic circuits can be blocked and the adaptation to HFD-induced hyperphagia attenuated ( 385 ). In addition, studies in photoperiodic models have shown that PSA and NCAM levels in tanycytes are reduced during short photoperiods in conjunction with vimentin levels, modulating the plasticity for tanycyte connections with arcuate neurons ( 387 ). 
         Diverse hormonal/metabolic signals could be involved in these structural modifications, including leptin. This hormone rapidly induces synaptic changes in metabolic circuits ( 381 ), with some of these effects being mediated through astrocytes. These glial cells express different isoforms of ObR ( 163 ,  164 ), with the expression of this receptor being increased in astrocytes of obese rodents ( 163 ). Leptin can modify astrocyte morphology, inducing changes in the length and number of primary astrocytic projections and astroglial coverage of hypothalamic neurons ( 173 ,  388 ). The lack of leptin signaling due to the knock-out of this receptor in astrocytes changes synaptic inputs to POMC and NPY neurons, resulting in modifications in the function of these metabolic neurons and rendering the animals less susceptible to the effects of leptin ( 173 ). However, it remains unclear as to the mechanisms involved in the changes in neuronal/glial interactions, including identification of the initial step that triggers these morphological modifications. 
         Astrocytes modulate neuronal transmission by controlling glutamate concentrations in the synaptic cleft, which also plays an important role in preventing excitotoxicity ( 389 ). Leptin and ghrelin modulate glutamate uptake by these glial cells ( 121 ,  122 ) and could thus affect stimulatory signaling in metabolic circuits through this mechanism. Astrocytes also actively participate in synaptic transmission and plasticity by releasing gliotransmitters, including adenosine, ATP,  d -serine, glutamate, and tumor necrosis factor α that directly activate postsynaptic receptors and by altering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neuronal elements to induce short-term plasticity and to modulate synaptic efficacy ( 12 ,  390 – 393 ). Adenosine release by astrocytes inhibits the firing rate of AgRP neurons and food intake, modifying the response to metabolic hormones such as ghrelin ( 394 ). 
       
       
         Inflammatory Response 
         The inflammatory response to infection, foreign substances, mechanical damage, or any situation that could damage neurons is one of the best studied functions of glial cells ( 231 ,  395 – 398 ). However, the description of hypothalamic inflammation in obesity, as well as its association with the development of secondary complications, is more recent. In 2005, the group of Licio Velloso reported that inflammatory pathways were activated in the hypothalamus in HFD-induced obese rats ( 399 ). This same group went on to demonstrate that this hypothalamic inflammation was involved in the disruption of systemic glucose homeostasis ( 35 ). Numerous studies have since reported the link between hypothalamic inflammation and obesity-related comorbidities ( 36 ,  400 – 404 ). Hypothalamic inflammation is reported to be associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes ( 405 ) and increased cell death in the hypothalamus ( 329 ). Most studies analyzing hypothalamic inflammation have employed HFD-induced obesity models and suggest that dietary factors are involved in at least part of the inflammatory response. Indeed, hypothalamic inflammation is reported to occur even before an increase in adiposity or systemic inflammation are detected ( 36 ) and central administration of saturated fatty acids directly activates inflammatory signaling mechanisms in the hypothalamus ( 35 ,  406 ). However, increased weight gain can occur in response to genetic, epigenetic, and excess energy intake that is not due to increased fat consumption and the hypothalamic inflammatory/gliosis response differs depending on the underlying cause of weight gain ( 121 ,  195 ,  407 ,  408 ). These differential responses are most likely the result of dietary signals and the changes in metabolic signals associated to weight gain acting on both microglia and astrocytes. Sex may also be a factor, as the hypothalamic inflammatory response to chronic HFD-intake is reported to differ between males and females, with males being more susceptible ( 409 ). This could result from the greater rise in PA levels in the CNS of male mice compared to females, even though there is no sex difference in circulating fatty acid levels ( 410 ). 
         Inhibition of hypothalamic inflammation is reported to blunt or block the development of obesity-associated complications ( 400 ,  403 ) and dietary restriction can reverse central inflammatory processes ( 411 – 415 ). Exercise also protects against HFD-induced hypothalamic inflammation ( 416 ). 
         
           Microglia in Hypothalamic Inflammation 
           Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, are the first line of defense in response to foreign substances ( 417 ,  418 ) and are activated in response to saturated fat consumption ( 36 ,  403 ,  408 ,  419 ). Indeed, these glial cells are suggested to dictate the inflammation that occurs in response to saturated fats ( 419 ). Microglia can also be activated when weight gain is due to excess intake of a normal diet and due to high fat intake, ( 402 ), indicating that not only dietary signals are involved. Leptin stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines from microglia ( 420 ), suggesting that hyperleptinemia could be involved in microglial activation in obese subjects. 
         
         
           Astrocytes in Hypothalamic Inflammation 
           Astrocytes also respond to HFD intake ( 36 ,  384 ,  421 ) and can be directly activated  in vitro  by fatty acids ( 408 ,  409 ,  422 ). Hyperleptinemia associated with weight gain may also participate in the activation of glia in situation of obesity ( 121 ,  173 ,  388 ,  408 ,  423 ). Indeed, ob/ob mice, which are dramatically obese due to the genetic lack of leptin, do not exhibit astrogliosis and leptin-induced weight loss actually increases astrocytic profiles in the hypothalamus of these animals ( 408 ). However, we have found that in some situations of increased weight gain, such as increased carbohydrate intake in the form of sucrose, astrocytic markers may actually be decreased ( 407 ). 
           The astrogliosis response to HFD differs between males and females, as does the  in vitro  response to PA ( 409 ). The protective effects of estrogens are exerted through ERα in astrocytes ( 424 ), with estrogens protecting against PA activation of astrocytes  in vitro  ( 409 ). Morselli et al demonstrated that HFD-intake reduces hypothalamic ERα levels in males, but not in females, which may be involved in the decreased protection against diet-induced obesity in males. 
           Astrocytes have also been implicated in determining the preference for a HFD, with this mechanism involving cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) ( 425 ,  426 ). The intake of a HFD induces the preference for this type of diet and this appears to involve the production of endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus ( 426 ). Leptin signaling in astrocytes is regulated by CB1, with disruption of CB1 in these glial cells resulting in the inability of leptin to regulate glycogen storage ( 307 ) and thus possibly affecting central energy storage and glucose sensing/signaling. 
         
       
     
     
       Conclusion 
       It is clear that non-neuronal cells are fundamental for the correct functioning of metabolic circuits, beginning with the essential process of regulating the nutrients and signals that reach these neurons. These cells are not only involved with the development, maintenance, and protection of their neuronal neighbors, but participate in all aspects of neuronal function (summarized in Figure  3 ). In the hypothalamus, numerous studies have shown how non-neuronal cells play an active role in the control of metabolism and in the pathological outcomes of poor metabolic control. Although the advances in laboratory techniques and genetically engineered animal models have increased our knowledge in this field, there is yet much to be learned regarding the mechanisms involved. Studies directed at developing markers to further identify different populations or subclasses of glial cells are of great importance in order to better understand the vast roles that these cells play in the different physiological functions controlled by the CNS. This increased knowledge will also hopefully add to our understanding of pathophysiological processes and future targets for treatments, including that of obesity and its secondary complications.

            Schematic representation of the main roles of hypothalamic non-neuronal cells in metabolism . Thin arrows represent the different connections between cells: fueling and sensing of nutrients (in blue); signaling through gliotransmitters, neurotransmitters, or other factors (in green); and recycling of molecules or cleaning of cellular debris (in purple). Hormones and nutrients from the bloodstream pass through one or more types of non-neuronal cells before reaching neurons, sometimes suffering metabolic changes during the process. In response to a metabolic imbalance (excess of saturated fatty acids, hyperleptinemia, etc), microglial cells change to an activated state, releasing inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, and activating astrocytes as a neuroprotective measure. If the insult continues, it can lead to gliosis, hypothalamic inflammation, and neuronal damage.

         Ethiopia recently introduced the Doctor of Physiotherapy (DPT) degree at Addis Ababa University as a mechanism to increase the work force capacity of primary care providers in the health sector. The DPT program was supported by an international academic partnership and was designed to empower physiotherapists as leaders to move the profession forward. The curriculum was framed by core pedagogical principles and strategies and was phased into two programs. First, the 4-year Advanced Standing DPT program focused on developing registered Ethiopian physiotherapists with Bachelor of Science degrees as academic faculty. Second, these new faculty would then sustain a 6-year Generic DPT program that would matriculate students upon graduation from high school. The curriculum represented depth and breadth of foundation and clinical sciences, evidence-based practice, clinical reasoning skills, and interprofessional education opportunities. A leadership thread provided opportunities to develop skills necessary to effectively navigate and manage the challenges faced by the profession. The main outcomes included (1) an 8-year international partnership, (2) the academic performance of students, and (3) and leadership capabilities as demonstrated through activities and assignments. While the program has been criticized as an unnecessary extravagance for Ethiopia, the advantages of the DPT degree were revealed in a direct comparison to other academic physiotherapy programs in Ethiopia. In the end, because the DPT is new to the country, it will take time to fully understand the true impact within the Ethiopian health system.

       Physiotherapy (PT) Profession: Historical Perspective 
       The PT profession in Ethiopia is relatively new when compared to the history of the profession in other countries ( 1 ). The modern era of the PT profession is thought to have begun in Europe toward the end of the nineteenth century. The early origins of physical therapy practice began in hospital-based settings to address the rehabilitation needs resulting from World War I causalities and for individuals impacted by disease epidemics, like poliomyelitis. Today, PTs manage patients with a broad array of health conditions and practice in many different settings, including hospitals, rural health outposts, community-based rehabilitation homes and centers, private and public outpatient clinics, public K-12 schools, pediatric and geriatric settings, and specialized rehabilitation centers ( 2 ). The progression of responsibilities and educational standards for entry into the profession has paralleled this expansion. The profession has moved from teaching technical skills, like exercise and massage, to evidence-based strategies for examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention of individuals with multisystem health conditions. More than 100 years later, the profession has transformed its entry-level education from short technical-training programs with highly circumscribed knowledge and skill sets to more comprehensive and rigorous professional education programs that culminate in undergraduate and graduate degrees. While not all countries regulate curriculum, some national associations and the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) have established guidelines for entry-level education requirements ( 3 ). Throughout the world, entry-level degrees span 2-year post-high school diplomas, to 3- and 4-year Bachelor of Science (BSc), 2-year Master of Science (MSc), and 3- and 4-year Doctor of Physiotherapy (DPT). Historically, African nations have offered primarily diplomas and have struggled to upgrade the diploma to a degree program ( 4 ). Ethiopia is an exception with the existence of BSc, MSc, and DPT degree options. 
     
     
       BSc and MSc Degree Programs: Gondar University 
       At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Ethiopia had only13 PTs registered to serve an estimated 15 million Ethiopians living with disabilities ( 5 ). In response to the critical shortage of PT workforce capacity, volunteers from the Netherlands and a team of Ethiopian physicians pioneered the Department of Physiotherapy at University of Gondar. The program sought “to be the best Physiotherapy Department in terms of education, health care and research in East Africa by the year 2020.” They defined their mission as, “committed to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the country achieving our goals through the provision of societal needs tailored education, conducting problem based research and delivering preventive, and rehabilitative services in the field of physiotherapy.” The 4-year BSc program continues to be supported by international faculty from India and the Netherlands. The first cohort of PTs graduated in 2006, with a total estimated graduation of 223 PTs as of 2016 ( 6 ). 
       The BSc curriculum (Table  1 ) integrates most of the basic foundational technical skill sets for entry-level education set forth by the WCPT ( 3 ). However, there is no apparent structure to support evidence-based practice, leadership development, critical thinking, problem solving, and professional judgment skill sets that are recognized as current best practices within the profession worldwide. As a mechanism to further advance the profession, Gondar University initiated a 2-year MSc in Physiotherapy degree in 2009. The MSc curriculum expanded the knowledge base in the content areas of neurologic, orthopedic, pediatric PT, and research methods (Table  1 ). The MSc program generally accepts a maximum of four BSc prepared PTs each year. To date, the MSc program has graduated an estimated 25 PTs and is supported by international faculty from the University of South Australia and the Netherlands ( 6 ).

       Challenges for PTs in Ethiopia 
       As with the introduction of any new health profession, Ethiopian PTs have met professional challenges within the health sector, which has impacted the general motivation by some to pursue or continue a career in PT. Thus, despite the development of the University of Gondar programs, Ethiopia continues to experience limitations in human resource capacity to meet the demand for rehabilitation services. There are a number of potential causes for the limitations. 
       First, there is a lack of overt public and government support for the physical therapists, possibly due to a limited understanding of this relatively new Ethiopian profession. Second, the Ministry of Education assigns post-high school students to the academic program based on their interests in health care and on their performance on the Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Certificate Examination. It is perceived that some of those assigned to PT programs would prefer to seek opportunities in other health professions. Third, while Ethiopian physicians have opportunities for continued professional development, the PT profession has extremely limited opportunity in this area. Thus, the growth and development of individual practitioners and the profession as a whole is limited by this void. Fourth, poor salary compensation may cause PTs to seek additional ways to supplement their income, or they choose to leave the profession altogether. Fifth, a shortage of qualified local PT faculty limits the ability to sustain the academic programs without international support. In addition, local faculty may not be fully qualified for academic roles as they often receive little to no formal training in teaching pedagogy, nor advanced PT skill sets to optimally integrate into the academy. Finally, Ethiopia has a broad Scope of Practice for the PT profession that is dependent upon the level of academic preparation. This leads to disparities in the delivery of patient care among PT providers. 
       The sum of the limitations greatly impacts the profession throughout the country. Therefore, the focus of this special topic paper is to describe the development of the DPT program at Addis Ababa University (AAU) as a potential strategy to alleviate the impact of the many limitations on the PT work force capacity in Ethiopia. 
     
     
       DPT Degree Programs: AAU 
       The DPT was introduced to Ethiopia at AAU in 2008. The program defined the vision to “be recognized in Sub-Saharan Africa as a center of excellence for education and service provision by doctors of physiotherapy. These doctors will be physical medicine experts who deliver optimal patient care and contribute to the goals of the health sector.” The development of the DPT program was planned in a partnership between AAU, Regis University (Denver, CO, USA), the Jackson Clinics Foundation, LLC (Middleburg, VA, USA). Over the 6-year planning period, the partnership developed relationships with several Ethiopian stakeholders that played critical roles in the formation and approval of the DPT program at AAU (Figure  1 ). The partners encountered many challenges during this planning phase, mostly related to the frequent replacement of the AAU College of Health Science and School of Medicine Deans and Directors and the accompanying breakdowns in communication between outgoing and incoming administrators. Despite the challenges, the AAU Senate ultimately approved the Advanced DPT Standing program in 2014 and matriculated the inaugural cohort of 17 registered PTs shortly thereafter.

       The introduction of the DPT at AAU was designed to occur in two phases as follows: (1) the Advanced Standing DPT Program and (2) the Generic DPT Program. 
       
         Phase 1: Advanced Standing DPT Program 
         The Advanced Standing DPT program was developed with consideration of the (1) social and economic development level of the country, (2) analysis of history, development, and present status of the PT profession in Ethiopia and in other countries, (3) educational sector development plan of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE), (4) health sector development plan of FDRE, (5) standards of admission, program design, licensing, and accreditation needs for the education of PT professionals, and (6) new developments in research within the profession of PT. The scope of the 4-year Advanced Standing curriculum (Table  2 ) was substantially greater than the Gondar BSc curriculum and was tailored to match the experience of the registered PTs and to specifically prepare them for professional roles as faculty of the Generic DPT program (see below). The graduation of the first cohort of Advanced Standing students is anticipated in May 2018. They will officially assume their roles as core and/or clinical faculty for the Generic DPT program in Fall 2018.

         In addition to the benefits cited for the Advanced Standing DPT program, the Generic DPT program will promote IPE collaboration in the classroom and in clinical practice and, thereby, expand potential for improved patient outcomes. Ultimately, the Generic DPT program will be fully sustained by PT faculty developed in the Advanced Standing program in coordination with the AAU medical school faculty. International faculty will not be needed to sustain the Generic DPT program. AAU plans to matriculate the first cohort of Generic DPT students in Fall 2017. 
       
     
     
       Pedagogical Principles and Framework for the DPT Curriculum 
       
         Core Pedagogy Principles 
         The development of the DPT curriculum was guided by six core pedagogical principles that emphasized empowerment, leadership, relationships, active engagement, reflection, and innovation. 
         
           
             Principle 1: empowerment through learning is the path to the future. 
           
           
             Principle 2: leaders dwell within everyone. 
           
           
             Principle 3: relationships form the basis of all learning. 
           
           
             Principle 4: students achieve growth by challenging the process and modeling the way. 
           
           
             Principle 5: active engagement amplifies learning achievement. 
           
           
             Principle 6: reflective processes inspire innovation. 
           
         
       
       
         Pedagogy Framework 
         
           Doctor of Physiotherapy 
           The pedagogical framework was designed to build upon the six core principles while acknowledging the local context of the physical medicine and rehabilitation needs of Ethiopia, the Scope of Practice, and the constraints of a resource-limited health environment (Figure  2 ). The DPT student was the primary focus of the framework, which aimed to empower, engage, motivate, inspire, transform, and develop leaders for the profession.

                Pedagogical framework for the Doctor of Physiotherapy programs . 
             
             
           
         
         
           Scope of Practice 
           The framework required a thorough understanding of the vision of the PT profession in Ethiopia and was, thus, guided by the Scope of Practice. The Ethiopian Physiotherapy Association and the Ethiopian Food, Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority jointly wrote the Scope of Practice. The academic degree determines the scope of duties that a PT can perform, e.g., technician, BSC, MSc, and DPT. Ethiopian DPT practitioners have the highest capacity of all academic PT degrees to deliver primary care services. 
         
         
           Pedagogical Format and Curriculum 
           As previously stated, the Advanced Standing DPT and Generic DPT programs curricula were specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Ethiopia. Ethiopia aimed to increase the workforce capacity by including PTs as primary care providers in the health system. Thus, the DPT curriculum had to expand its scope beyond the BSc and MSc to meet the expectations and responsibilities that accompany the provision of primary care. For example, Ethiopian DPTs needed training to order medically relevant diagnostic tests, participate in the management of medical/surgical emergencies or trauma, perform specialty interventions such as mechanical decompression, plastering techniques, joint and soft tissue injections, prescribe neuromusculoskeletal medications, perform minor trauma suturing, reduce and stabilize minor fractures and dislocations, and perform electromyography, lower extremity Doppler tests, and stress tests. The curriculum also included a leadership thread to cultivate and empower leaders for the PT profession. A teaching and learning thread was also woven throughout the curriculum to develop Ethiopian faculty that could independently sustain the academic programs. Finally, the curriculum was taught with IPE collaboration among the faculty and students from other health professions to facilitate networking and teamwork among health professionals. 
           The curriculum was delivered in accordance with the guidelines for AAU College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine modular undergraduate curriculum. The Advanced Standing DPT program included 51 courses (Table  2 ) that were sectioned into 18 content modules (see below).

             All courses were delivered in a blocked design, where students were required to take one course to completion before beginning the next course and subsequent module. The blocked design also accommodated the international faculty travel schedules. 
             The Generic program will also be taught with a modular system but will be taught with a traditional distributed delivery model rather than a blocked model. In addition, the Generic program will expand the curriculum to 6-years; thus 21 new courses (Table  3 ) will be sectioned into 12 new modules (see below).

             The additional 12 modules will be taught by AAU medical school faculty and represent the current foundational courses for medical students. The DPT students will take these courses alongside medical students during their first 2 years of the curriculum. 
           
         
         
           Pedagogical Strategies and Learning Environment 
           The Advanced Standing DPT program employed several pedagogical strategies throughout the curriculum to meet the needs of diverse learners and to expose the students to a variety of strategies that would be available to them as they prepared for their roles as future faculty. 
           
             Learning Environment 
             The curriculum was delivered with a hybrid model that utilized ground-based and distance-based delivery models to accommodate the availability of experienced international faculty. Ground-based instruction incorporated both didactic and practical (action-based) skill development and was delivered in a traditional classroom on the AAU School of Medical campus. Distance-based was primarily utilized for the delivery of didactic content and was delivered through a Skype connection into the AAU classroom. 
           
           
             Lecture 
             Traditional lecture formats were utilized throughout the curriculum, but with intentional efforts to actively engage the student in dialog. Non-traditional lecture formats that utilized technology with audio-enhance lectures (flipped classroom concept) were also implemented when a faculty member could not be on-site or when students needed additional course review beyond the physical structure of the classroom. 
           
           
             Labs 
             Many of the courses incorporated lab experiences to teach, learn, demonstrate, and practice practical skills. 
           
           
             Small Group Instruction 
             Clinical mentoring courses for experiential patient management were performed in small groups of 3–4 students. The curriculum included a series of nine clinical mentoring courses. A similar model will be incorporated into the Generic program. 
           
           
             Student Demonstration/Instruction 
             Adopting the model, “See One. Do One. Teach One,” the students were frequently encouraged to assume the role of instructor to gain experience for their future roles as faculty. 
           
           
             Team-Based Learning (TBL) 
             Students completed individual readiness assurance tests and team readiness assurance tests on content assigned for specific days within selected courses. The TBL model encouraged learners to arrive to class fully prepared to engage in teamwork with other students. 
           
           
             Problem-Based Learning 
             Contextual-based case scenarios were adapted for various courses to promote thoughtful reflection, dialog, critical thinking, problem solving, and group process. 
           
           
             Assessment 
             The students were assessed with a variety of methods, including written examinations, quizzes, practical examinations, written assignments, and oral presentations. 
           
         
         
           Partnership 
           As stated earlier, academic instruction for the Advanced Standing program was supported by an international partnership. The partnership was manifested through a complex network of relationships (Figure  1 ) and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that delineated the roles of each partner in supporting the program. In short, all partners had human resource commitments related to administrative roles and teaching responsibilities within the curriculum, as well as fiscal and physical resource commitments. The international partners also committed to providing mentorship to the newly formed faculty upon their graduation but do not plan to formally teach within the academic programs thereafter. 
         
       
     
     
       Competencies and Objectives 
       The DPT curriculum represented depth and breadth of both foundational and clinical sciences and was accompanied by competencies and objectives reflective of an entry-level DPT curriculum. In addition, a leadership thread was woven throughout the curriculum to develop leadership for the advancement of the profession in Ethiopia. 
       The leadership goals and objectives were unique to AAU’s DPT program and were not represented within the BSc program at the University of Gondar. They included the following:
   Illustrate the social responsibilities of a doctoring profession.    Advocate for patient and community needs.    Commit to meet professional obligations.    Consider the determinants that impact societal health and wellness.    Adhere to high ethical principles and professional values and standards.    Accept responsibility for roles, obligations, and actions of the physiotherapist.    Consider social, emotional, and psychological components in patient care.    Acknowledge that effective health care depends on a mutual understanding and relationship between the health-care team, patient, and the family with respect for the patient’s welfare, culture, identity, beliefs, and autonomy.    Demonstrate patient-centered actions ahead of the self-interest of the physiotherapist by treating patients with politeness and consideration, respecting their dignity, privacy, and point of view without regard to background, culture, language, religion, race, and point of view.    Participate in lifelong learning to ensure ongoing high levels of knowledge and clinical competence.    Serve as leaders to elevate the standards of PT care in Ethiopia to best meet the needs of society.    
     
     
       Current Results and Outcomes 
       
         Partnership 
         As stated previously, the partnership experienced significant turnover within the AAU academic administration. The Executive Director of the college of Health Sciences changed three times, the Academic Dean of the School of Medicine changed four times, the Associate Dean of the College of Health Sciences changed four times, the Director of Undergraduate Medical Education changed three times, and the Director of the Department of Orthopedics (where the Unit of Physiotherapy resides) changed five times. The instability and longevity of the higher education administration made the progression of the program difficult. Fortunately, the commitment of the DPT program Coordinator at AAU remained constant throughout all of the transitions in higher administration to sustain the partnership. All partners remain committed to the progression of the academic programs. 
       
       
         Generic DPT Program Development 
         The Generic DPT curriculum is currently in its final stage of development. The curriculum is scheduled for submission to the AAU Senate for review and approval in early 2017. Once it is approved, AAU will begin the process to matriculate post-high school students into the program in Fall 2017. 
       
       
         Advanced Standing DPT Students 
         
           Survey 
           The 17 DPT students that matriculated into the Advanced Standing DPT program are currently completing the third year of the curriculum. To date, 36 courses have been taught by a total of 29 faculty, including 14 different AAU faculty for 18 courses, 7 different Regis University faculty for 15 courses, and 8 Jackson Clinics Foundation clinicians for 3 courses. 
           An extensive survey was administered to all students at the end of their first year. The survey addressed three primary areas and utilized a 4-point scale; 1 = novice: shows an understanding of the behavior but does not consistently act in this manner; 2 = competent: performs the behavior upon request, but not necessarily in every day activities; 3 = proficient: regularly acts in this manner and can provide recent examples; and 4 = expert: always behaves in this way and can illustrate with many recent examples. 
           
             
               Professional behaviors, roles, and responsibilities of the DPT profession: the domains with an average score in the proficiency range (mean = 3.07–3.14; SD = 0.57–61) were leadership, collaboration and relations building, communication, and altruism. The domains in the competency range (mean = 2.55–2.81; SD = 0.57–0.69) were professional roles and behaviors, advocacy, social responsibility, accountability/ethical/legal issues, self-assessment/peer-assessment, education, evidence-based practice, and critical thinking/clinical reasoning. 
             
             
               Principles for patient management: the domain with an average score in the proficiency range (mean = 3.01; SD = 0.44) was guiding principles for examination. The domains in the competency range (mean = 2.71–2.97; SD = 0.22–0.61) were guiding principles for diagnostic tests, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, plan of care, intervention, outcomes assessment, and education intervention. 
             
             
               System and patient-specific management: the domain with an average score in the proficiency range (mean = 3.05; SD = 0.56) was musculoskeletal examination. The domains in the competency range (mean = 2.13–2.99; SD = 0.51–0.88) were cardiopulmonary, integumentary (examination only), musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, orthotic/prosthetic/protective devices, and assistive/adaptive devices. The domains with an average score in the novice range (mean = 1.84–1.90; SD = 0.79–0.85) were integumentary procedural interventions and special populations. 
             
           
           The survey will be readministered at the completion of the 4-year Advanced Standing DPT program, and the results will be analyzed as a component of the overall assessment of the program. 
         
       
       
         Leadership Development 
         The critics of the AAU DPT degree argue that a change in academic degree will not resolve the challenges faced by the PT profession in Ethiopia. Indeed, they are probably right. Taken at face value, the expansion of the curriculum with the DPT degree is evident. However, less obvious was how the leadership thread served as a potential mechanism to address the aforementioned limitations. 
         The leadership thread was an integral part of the Advanced Standing program and will continue with the Generic DPT program. The thread exposed students to a variety of leadership theories, models, and assessment tools. It offered opportunities to engage in reflective processes and gain perspectives on personal leadership styles as well as the leadership traits of others. Students individually and jointly reflected on their personal and professional values and future roles and responsibilities in the Ethiopian health-care environment. They also deliberated on leadership topics in groups to identify core professional values that they believed could lead the profession forward in Ethiopia. The current cohort identified the core PT values as professionalism, timeliness, accountability, knowledge and skills, and transparency and coupled them with their personal values of compassion, integrity, love, kindness, and honesty. Finally, the cohort worked as a team to develop action verbs to accompany the personal and professional values that would enable them to act upon the identified values. They chose to empower, promote, work, demonstrate, strive, pursue, and engage. 
         The thread required students to develop personal mission statements that could guide their journey as individual leaders in academia and clinical practice. General themes that emerged from the mission statements included statements to lead the PT profession forward through active involvement in policy making, to inspire and empower current and future PTs, to embrace altruism in practice, to advance the quality of patient care, and to be accountable to the profession and those that they served. 
         The culminating activity within the leadership thread was the development and implementation of personal leadership projects. The projects were a mechanism to motivate and empower them to address the challenges in Ethiopia by engaging as positive change agents. The leadership projects reflected the added value of the leadership thread within the curriculum. The leadership project themes ranged from being able to more fully integrate PTs as leaders within the Ministry of Health and improving the awareness of the profession in the country to improving PT work efficiencies and physical environments in hospitals and clinics to increase job satisfaction and retention of PTs in the work force. The general feedback about the leadership thread from the current cohort was extremely positive, as many of them believed they could be positive change agents and lead the profession forward as a result of the leadership development process. 
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       Ethiopia has made great advances in developing academic programs to address the shortage of PTs in the workforce. Over the past 15 years, the contributions of Gondar University’s BSc and MSc programs have contributed over 200 PTs to the physical medicine and rehabilitation sector. The DPT programs at AAU were designed to address the mounting challenges of the profession by increasing the scope of the curriculum for primary care and developing leaders to move the profession forward. 
       The DPT programs have been subjected to criticism, especially since the degree is new to Ethiopia and all of Africa. The harsh opinions have included statements such as:
   “Africa does not need doctoral education. They simply need basic training to meet the general growing needs of the population.” (USAID Representative)    “Ethiopia does not need autonomous PTs, they need to work with the physicians as a team.” (European Physician)    “The BSc degree works around the world. Does the world really need the American DPT?” (European PT)    
       To the critics, it can be argued that the challenges will only continue to grow if innovation is not pursued. Examination of the different curricular models in Ethiopia revealed the advantages of DPT degree compared to the BSc and MSc degree. Benefits to the profession included developing leaders; advancing clinical reasoning skills and application of evidence-based practice beyond the technical skill sets associated with the BSc and MSc programs; broadening the depth of foundational and clinical practice knowledge to fully address the professional scope of practice in primary care; promoting a culture of lifelong learning and service to others; envisioning positive change for the future of the profession; instituting IPE in educational curricula and clinical practice for optimization of patient outcomes; developing local faculty to sustain academic programs; increasing the potential for greater income, as the DPT will be compensated on a doctoral scale like physicians; and improving the potential for greater recognition and sustained increased in work force capacity within the profession. While preliminary data have been collected related to professional behaviors, roles, and responsibilities of the DPT profession, principles for patient management, and system and patient-specific management, future analysis of data from graduation surveys will serve as quantitative markers of the impact of the program. 
     
     
       Limitations and Recommendations 
       The greatest limitation of the DPT program at AAU has been the inconsistencies of higher administration support due to the frequent turnover of personnel. It is strongly recommended that the primary coordinator/director of the program have a strong presence in the daily academic environment to ensure stability and sustainability of the program. Limitations were also noted in the availability of AAU medical school faculty and international PT faculty. The MOU designated courses to be taught by the AAU medical school faculty, but it was often difficult to secure the actual commitment of the faculty. The challenge was related to difficulties in communication and expectations between higher administration and the faculty. For almost all of the international faculty, they could only commit to teach in 2-week blocks due to ongoing responsibilities within their home institutions. Students reported that they would have preferred the courses to be taught over a 3- to 4-week timeframe to allow time to fully integrate the course materials. In addition, the expense to send international faculty to Ethiopia was quite high. The opportunities for external funding and grants were essentially non-existent for the DPT program, as most grants/funds directed to Africa targeted HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and other medical student education programs. Advocacy for the PT education and profession grants in Africa would be strongly encouraged. Finally, the DPT program at AAU was specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Ethiopia and, thus, the curriculum may not be fully generalizable to other countries. However, the degree has many benefits that warrant careful consideration as a potential mechanism to upgrade the diploma to a degree in Africa. With this in mind, the process by which the DPT was developed in Ethiopia is, indeed, generalizable. The process involved a grassroots movement of Ethiopian PTs, a collaborative partnership for expertise (it would be difficult for any one person to have all the necessary expertise to develop a new academic model in any country), support of internal (academic institution) and external governing bodies (ministries, etc.), and students willing to commit to a pioneering academic program. The process requires time to navigate necessary systems to launch the program. It is very important to be patient. Due diligence to complete all requirements to launch a new program is the ultimate key to facilitating the sustainability and success of the DPT degree. 
     
     
       Conclusion 
       Since the program is still very new, it will take time to understand the impact of the DPT in Ethiopia. The only marker that exists at this time is the performance of the 17 students currently enrolled in the Advanced Standing program, all of who graduated from the BSc program at Gondar University. One particular student comment stands out to reflect the value of the DPT program:
  I never knew what it was to be a PT until I started the DPT program.   
       So, the question to be asked is. “Can the DPT make a difference in Ethiopia?” If any credence is to be applied to the empowerment potential of the leaders being developed in the Advanced Standing DPT program, then the answer will hopefully emerge as, “Yes, the DPT can make a difference!”

          Objective:  The avoidance of mental effort is a symptom criterion for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but the experience of mental effort has received relatively little attention in the empirical study of individuals at-risk for ADHD. We explored a novel method to assess the experience of effort and discomfort during a working memory task in a sample of young adults at-risk and not at-risk for ADHD. 
          Method:  A sample of 235 undergraduate students (Mean age = 21.02, 86 males) were included in this study. Based on an ADHD-screener (ASRS), 136 participants met criteria for the ADHD-risk group and 99 were in the non-ADHD risk group. 
          Results:  Individuals at-risk for ADHD reported higher mental effort and discomfort than individuals not at-risk for ADHD, even when performance on the working memory task was comparable or statistically controlled. Mental effort required and discomfort were more strongly correlated for at-risk compared to not at-risk participants. Individuals at-risk for ADHD displayed a stronger correlation between mental effort required and actual accuracy, but individuals not at-risk for ADHD displayed a stronger association between perceived accuracy and actual accuracy for the hardest experimental conditions. The most intense moment of effort required predicted retrospective discomfort ratings of the task in the ADHD-risk group, but not in the non-risk group. 
          Conclusion:  The subjective experience of  in the moment  mental effort is an important and viable construct that should be more carefully defined and measured. In particular, the experience of effort required (or how taxing a task is) differentiated between individuals at-risk and individuals not at-risk for ADHD in the present study. Whereas previous ADHD research has explored effort exerted, the present work demonstrated that investigating the experience of being mentally taxed might provide a productive line of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the cognitive and affective mechanisms underlying the regulation of effort in individuals at-risk of ADHD.

       Introduction 
       The point of departure for the present work is the observation that there are individual differences in how mentally effortful tasks are experienced. For some, a cognitively demanding task is a welcomed opportunity, for others such a task can’t end soon enough. Individual differences are evident in both what it feels like  ‘in the moment’  to complete a mentally effortful task (e.g.,  this  task is requiring a lot of effort; see for example,  Paas, 1992 ;  von Helversen et al., 2008 ;  Robinson and Morsella, 2014 ) and  ‘generalized thoughts and feelings’  about mental effort (e.g., I often find math questions require a lot of effort; see for example,  Dornic et al., 1991 ;  Cacioppo et al., 1996 ). This difference between effort in the moment and generalized thoughts and feelings largely maps onto the classic distinction between states and traits. In this study, we focused on measuring the “ in the moment ” experience of effort during a cognitively demanding task. In addition, we identified individuals at-risk for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as avoidance of effortful tasks is diagnostic of these individuals (DSM-5,  American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013 ). We examined differences between those at-risk for ADHD and those not at-risk in terms of their experience of mental effort during a cognitive demanding task, and whether these differences were separable from task performance. 
       The  ‘in the moment’  versus  ‘generalized thoughts and feelings’  about mental effort distinction provides some conceptual clarity for understanding the experience of mental effort, but there is still a long way to go in defining this construct in a more precise manner for proper empirical investigation. In part, this is because the experience of mental effort is a broad and often ill-defined concept with a variety of different aspects. Like the proverbial blind men, researchers have grasped different aspects of the elephant and come to different understandings. There are at least three distinct aspects of mental effort that need to be distinguished in participants’ subjective self-reports. Participants can report  ‘how hard I tried’  (i.e., effort volitionally exerted);  ‘how taxed I felt’  (i.e., effort extracted for level of achievement) and  ‘how difficult the task is’  (i.e., effort potentially demanded). The key difference between  ‘how hard I tried’  and  ‘how taxed I felt’  relates to agency. The first puts the emphasis on what one brings to the task; that is, one’s level of motivation and energy to do one’s best, or not. Whereas the second puts the emphasis on what the task does to the individual; that is, how much the task burdened or required of the individual. It is possible to imagine situations where a person might report trying hard to do their best but also report finding that the task did not require a lot of them. This conceptual distinction has borne out empirically. For example,  Mulert et al. (2007)  found that amount of “effort required” (i.e., how taxed I felt) varied in direct proportion to objective task difficulty, whereas amount of “volitional effort” (i.e., how hard I tried) was more constant across variations in task difficulty. The key difference between  ‘how taxed I felt’  and  ‘how difficult the task is’  is whether the focus is on the burden experienced by the individual or on the external task and its characteristics. The first puts the emphasis on what the task does to the individual ( how much the task burdened or required of me ), whereas the second puts the emphasis on characteristics of the task ( whether it is difficult relative to other possible tasks ). It is possible to imagine situations where a person might report feeling very taxed and report that the task was not very difficult; perhaps they did not get a good night of sleep and are thus very inattentive, but recognize that relative to other tasks this one is actually not that difficult. This conceptual distinction has also been borne out empirically. For example,  Otto et al. (2014)  found that the ratings of mental effort (i.e.,  how taxed I felt ) were associated with increased activation in the left anterior insular cortex (aIC) compared to ratings of task difficulty (i.e.,  how difficult the task is ) during a working memory task. Taken as a whole, there are conceptual and empirical reasons to believe that investigators studying mental effort must take care to distinguish between these different aspects of the experience of mental effort. 
       Mental effort is central to the definition of ADHD, surprisingly, however, this topic has garnered relatively little systematic research. One of the ADHD criterion stipulates that an individual with ADHD: “often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).” (p. 59,  American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013 ). Given the requirement for pervasiveness of signs and symptoms in order to obtain a diagnosis of ADHD, this diagnostic criterion suggests a dispositional quality related to avoidance of effort in individuals with ADHD. The Brown Scale is a standardized tool that was developed to provide a broader clinical characterization of the inattentive symptoms and executive problems associated with ADHD ( Brown, 1996 ). This measure includes an Effort Scale, defined by inconsistent energy and inconsistent sustained effort. It appears that the Effort Scale is assessing something akin to the ‘ how hard I (typically) try ’ aspect of mental effort given that items suggest a lack of energy and a failure to work to potential. Adolescents with ADHD have reported more difficulty sustaining effort as indicated by significant differences on the Effort Scale compared to an adolescent control group ( Rucklidge and Tannock, 2002 ). Similarly, the Cognitive and Motivation in Everyday Life (CAMEL) Scale ( Van Liefferinge et al., 2016 ), which assesses neuropsychological impairments in children and youth with ADHD, appears to tap into the  ‘how hard I (typically) try’  aspect of mental effort. Sample items from the Effort Allocation Scale of the CAMEL are: “Takes time to warm-up – to get going on a task”; “Puts things off until the last minute,” and “Chooses the way with least effort.” Parents were asked to rate their children and youth based on the extent to which the items described their children’s behavior using a five-point Likert scale. Children with ADHD scored significantly lower on this scale compared to children in the community sample, demonstrating a medium effect size, indicating difficulties with effort allocation in the clinical group. 
        Sergeant’s (2000 ,  2005 ) cognitive-energetic model has proposed a role for state effort in explaining ADHD deficits. In this model, effort is conceptualized as a state factor (including arousal and activation), which is separable from computational mechanisms (such as encoding, search, decision, and motor organization) and management or evaluation mechanisms (related to executive functions). Specifically, effort is defined as “the necessary energy to meet the demands of a task” ( Sergeant, 2000 , p. 8). In this model, task demands are thought to impact effort, whereby greater cognitive load elicits greater mobilization of energy (or effort). Relatively little research has examined the energetic state component of Sergeant’s model. However, children with ADHD have been shown to perform more poorly in tasks with slow compared to fast event rates ( Sergeant et al., 1999 ). Unlike previous research on ADHD and mental effort, Sergeant’s model focuses on state  ‘in the moment’  effort. But like previous ADHD research, this model appears to be focusing on the  ‘how hard I tried’  aspect of mental effort. That is, suggesting that individuals with ADHD struggle to mobilize and volitionally exert the effort needed, especially on tasks that are de-energizing. 
       Given that avoidance of mentally effortful tasks is a diagnostic criterion of ADHD, it is somewhat surprising that relatively little systematic research has been done on the topic. Most of the research has focused on ratings of general thoughts, feelings and dispositions and even more specifically trait dispositions regarding how hard individuals try to complete mentally effortful tasks. A smaller amount of work, largely centered around Sergeant’s theory, has modeled a key role for  in the moment  considerations focusing on how much effort is exerted. To our knowledge, no research has examined whether individuals with ADHD or related difficulties systematically differ in their experience of ‘how taxed’ they are by cognitive tasks compared to non-ADHD individuals. Given that many theories of mental effort postulate that the experience of being mentally taxed may serve as a regulatory signal to disengage from effortful tasks (e.g.,  Kurzban, 2016 ), investigating the experience of being mentally taxed in individuals with ADHD-related difficulties may prove to be a productive focus of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the regulation of effort in at-risk samples. Thus, the overarching goal of the present work was to systematically describe how the subjective experience of mental effort required (i.e., experience of being burdened or taxed) is different for individuals at-risk for ADHD compared to those not at-risk for ADHD. 
       In the current study, we modeled our experimental design and data analytic approach on a pain study completed by  Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) . During colonoscopy and lithotripsy medical procedures (which were painful procedures at the time their study was conducted),  Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996)  asked participants to report their level of pain every 60 s. Then, within 1 h of completing the medical procedure, participants were asked to recall the total amount of pain they experienced. These authors found that the most intense ratings of pain during the procedure and the final ratings of pain at the end of the procedure were the most robust predictors of retrospective ratings – this phenomenon has come to be called the ‘peak-end effect.’ In a review of research on the ‘peak-end’ effect,  Fredrickson (2000)  argued that the broader principle is that moments of personal significance or salience are the best predictors of recall, and that peak and final moments are typically salient for most people. Applying this methodology from the pain literature, we assessed how taxed and uncomfortable participants felt during the completion of a cognitively demanding task and how uncomfortable participants recall the task to be after it was completed. We also measured their actual performance and their perceived performance. 
       We examined whether individuals at-risk for ADHD would find a cognitively demanding task more taxing (i.e., effort required) and uncomfortable than individuals not at-risk for ADHD. Specifically, we used an  in the moment  methodology that provides a specific reference point to a cognitively demanding task for these ratings. We asked participants to rate the effort required and discomfort at regular intervals during this task. We predicted that the at-risk group would rate the task as requiring more effort and as more uncomfortable than the non-risk group, even when performance accuracy was comparable in both groups. Further, if effort required and discomfort is more salient in the at-risk group these ratings should be more strongly associated with performance accuracy among the at-risk group than in the non-risk group. Finally, given our predictions regarding the salience of effort required and discomfort in the at-risk group, we predicted that the most intense (or peak ratings) of effort required would be particularly strong predictors of the at-risk group’s retrospective memories of discomfort associated with the working memory task. Given the novelty of the methodology used in this study, we examined our hypotheses in extreme groups that were identified using cut-offs on an ADHD symptom screening measure (at-risk ADHD and non-risk ADHD groups). 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Ethics Statement 
         The experimental protocol was approved by the Human Participants Review Committee of York University’s Office of Research Ethics. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants at the very beginning of the research protocol before any data was collected. Participants were free to withdraw consent at any time and still receive course credit. 
       
       
         Participants 
         A sample of 235 participants (Mean age = 21.02,  SD  = 5.69, 86 males) was selected for inclusion in this study from a larger sample of 431 university undergraduate students (mean age: 20.59,  SD : 4.97, age range: 17–55, female: 68%) who participated in a larger study for course credit. Data from 30 participants were excluded from the analyses for the following reasons: participants failed the practice trials on the working memory task, participants were deemed to be outliers due to excessively poor performance on the working memory task (i.e., accuracy at any block was more than three standard deviations away from the mean of the blocks with the same difficulty) or participants had incomplete or missing data. Some data from these participants are reported in another study addressing different questions (Hsu et al., unpublished). 
         In the present study, we used the adult ADHD Self-Report Symptom Checklist screener (ASRS,  Kessler et al., 2005 ) to identify extreme groups, so that we could compare participants with ADHD-related difficulties to participants who are not at-risk. Namely, participants who scored above the threshold on four or more items were identified as at-risk of ADHD, and participants who score above the threshold on one or zero items were classified as not at-risk. Based on this ASRS screening criterion, we selected 136 at-risk participants (mean age: 20.49,  SD  = 5.20, 49 males) and 99 not at-risk participants (mean age: 21.77,  SD  = 6.26, 37 males) for the ADHD non-risk group resulting in a total of 235 participants for final analysis. The two groups did not differ in age and gender (all  p  &gt; 0.05). 
       
       
         Measures 
         
           Working Memory Task 
           We used an adapted version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT,  Gronwall, 1977 ) to elicit mental effort. In this task digits were visually presented on a computer screen, one at a time, in a continuous stream. Participants were asked to continuously add the numerical digits. Each digit was presented on the screen for 1 s. An orienting auditory beep was simultaneously presented with each digit. The delay between the offset of one digit and the onset of the next digit was 4 s. Participants were instructed to sum the last two digits they had seen and to enter their response using a keyboard. Participants were able to respond as soon as the latest digit appeared and during the 4 s delay; thus, within a response window of 5 s. Each ‘block’ required participants to provide a total of 15 sums (i.e., 15 trials with a total of 16 digits presented). The task had five conditions differing in duration, i.e., the number of blocks ranging from five to nine blocks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions. Each block was one of three levels of difficulty – easy, medium or hard. Task difficulty was randomly varied within participants such that each participant received one easy block, one hard block, and three to seven medium difficulty blocks depending on the duration condition completed. The blocks were presented in a pseudo-randomized sequence, such that the first and last blocks were always medium difficulty. The intervening blocks were composed of one easy, one hard, and one to five medium blocks. The hard trials involved adding one single and one double digit. The medium trials involved adding two single digits that summed to more than nine. The easy trials involved adding two single digits that summed to nine or less. 
           At the start of the PASAT participants completed two practice blocks of medium difficulty to ensure they fully comprehended the task and to familiarize them with the task demands. Following the practice blocks, participants were asked some questions regarding their anticipated experience of the task (including how much mental effort they expected would be required to complete the task and how much discomfort they expected during the task; the data on these questions were not examined in this study). After each block of trials, participants were required to rate their experience of effort and discomfort. Specifically, the questions were (1) “Rate your current level of mental effort” (1 = None; 7 = A lot) and (2) “Rate your current level of discomfort or distress” (1 = None; 7 = A lot). These scores are referred to as ‘real-time’ mental effort and discomfort ratings as they were obtained during the PASAT. After completing the PASAT task, participants completed a demographic and self-report questionnaire that was approximately 6 min in duration. After completing the demographic questionnaire, participants were required to retrospectively evaluate their experience with the PASAT task. Specifically, the questions included (1) “How much mental effort, in total, was required to complete this working memory task?” (1 = None; 7 = A lot); (2) “On this working memory task, what was your total amount of discomfort or distress?” (1 = None; 7 = A lot); (3) “How well did you perform on the working memory task” (1 = Significantly below average; 7 = Significantly above average); and (4) “How willing would you be to do another working memory task right now?”(1 = Not at all willing; 7 = Definitely willing). 
         
         
           Raven’s Progressive Matrices 
           Advanced items from the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) were used to assess participants’ non-verbal intelligence ( Raven et al., 1998 ). This task contains a series of designs with a missing part. Participants were instructed to complete the design by selecting the missing part from eight options. This task had 18 trials in total and a time limit of 15 min. The number of correct responses was summed such that a higher score indicated higher non-verbal ability. 
         
         
           ADHD Self-Report Scale 
           The ADHD self-report scale (ASRS) screener was developed by  Kessler et al. (2005)  and is based on symptoms of ADHD described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition). Participants are asked to rate their level of each symptom based on the last 6 months. Of the 18 symptoms,  Kessler et al. (2005)  found six items to be highly predictive of ADHD, and these six items comprise the screener. Within the six items of the screener, four are based on symptoms of inattention with the other two based on hyperactivity. Sample question includes: “ How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?. ” It is scored using a five-point Likert scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and very often). Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.73. Each item has a frequency threshold, and participants who scored above the threshold on four or more items were identified as the ADHD-risk group and participants who scored above the threshold on one or zero items were identified as the ADHD non-risk group. 
         
       
       
         Statistical Analyses 
         In order to examine differences between the ADHD-risk and non-risk groups, we used independent  t -tests to examine differences in: real-time ratings of mental effort and discomfort, task performance, slopes of real-time mental effort and discomfort and non-verbal ability. Pearson’s correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between real-time effort and discomfort and between the average of real-time mental effort, discomfort, perceived performance and actual performance on the PASAT separately in the ADHD-risk and non-risk groups. The group differences in correlations were examined using Fisher’s  r -to- z  transformation. Finally, the association between effort (peak and end) and retrospective discomfort were examined separately in the ADHD-risk and non-risk groups, including regression analyses to examine whether the most intense ratings of effort interacted with ADHD status in predicting retrospective ratings of discomfort. 
       
     
     
       Results 
       
         Did the ADHD-Risk and ADHD Non-risk Group Differ in Their Experience of Mental Effort? 
         As evident in  Table  1  , the ADHD-risk group experienced a higher level of mental effort and discomfort during the PASAT. As for the retrospective evaluation, the ADHD-risk group recalled experiencing a higher level of mental effort and discomfort compared to the non-risk group. The ADHD-risk group also reported a significantly lower level of perceived performance on the PASAT, and was more reluctant to repeat the task compared to the non-risk group. The ADHD-risk group performed significantly worse than the non-risk group on the PASAT, especially on the hard and medium blocks of PASAT. There was no group difference in accuracy on the easy block. Effect sizes for each of the comparisons are presented in the final column, indicating medium to large effect sizes on several of the group differences related to mental effort and discomfort.

         We conducted a univariate ANOVA to examine whether group differences on both effort required and discomfort ratings (and separately for real-time and retrospectively) would remain significant after statistically controlling for mean performance. Group differences remained significant for both real-time effort required,  F (1,232) = 12.99,  p  &lt; 0.001, and retrospective effort required,  F (1,232) = 18.89,  p  &lt; 0.001. Group differences also remained significant for both real-time discomfort,  F (1,232) = 21.99,  p  &lt; 0.001, and retrospective discomfort,  F (1, 232) = 26.46,  p  &lt; 0.001. 
         The difference in the slopes of real-time mental effort and discomfort between groups was non-significant, suggesting that the change of effort and discomfort over time were comparable between the two groups. There was also no significant difference in non-verbal ability for the ADHD-risk group and the non-ADHD risk group. 
         In addition, we examined group differences in the magnitude of the correlations between real-time effort and real-time discomfort ratings. The size of this correlation was  r  = 0.43,  p  &lt; 0.001 in the non-risk group and the size of this correlation was  r  = 0.62,  p  &lt; 0.001 in the ADHD-risk group. The correlation between real-time mental effort and discomfort was significantly higher within the ADHD-risk group as compared to the non-risk group (Fisher’s  Z  = 1.98,  p  &lt; 0.05). 
       
       
         Does the Relation between Subjective Experience and Task Performance Differ between ADHD Non-risk and ADHD-risk Groups? 
          Table  2   compares correlations between average real-time mental effort required and task performance for the ADHD-risk and non-risk groups. The ADHD-risk group showed significant correlations between average real-time ratings of mental effort required and performance accuracy on the PASAT, indicating that more effort required was associated with lower accuracy. Alternatively, the non-risk group did not show significant correlations between average real-time mental effort required and performance accuracy. The magnitude of the correlation between average real-time mental effort and PASAT accuracy in the hard condition was significantly larger in the ADHD-risk group compared to the non-risk group based on a one-tailed  Z  test, Fisher’s  Z  (1,  N  = 235) = 1.78,  p  &lt; 0.05. Thus, taken together, the relation between real-time mental effort required and task performance appears to be more robust for the ADHD-risk group than in the non-risk group, especially in the most difficult condition. We obtained parallel findings when we examined associations between ratings of discomfort and performance accuracy, and this difference between groups was also statistically significant in the most difficult condition, Fisher’s  Z  (1,  N  = 235) = 1.79,  p  &lt; 0.05. We also examined the association between perceived performance and actual performance in each group. Both groups displayed significant positive correlations, but the correlation for the non-risk group was significantly larger than for the ADHD-risk group in the difficult condition, Fisher’s  Z  (1,  N  = 235) = 1.69,  p  &lt; 0.05.

         Do Peak and End Real-time Mental Effort Differentially Predict Retrospective Discomfort in the ADHD-risk and Non-risk Groups? 
          Table  3   presents the results of two simultaneous multiple regression analyses using peak and end real-time effort required predicting retrospective discomfort, one conducted in the ADHD non-risk sample and the other conducted in the ADHD risk sample. While the overall models were significant for both groups, the peak real-time effort required was a significant predictor in the ADHD-risk group but not in the non-risk group.

The interaction between group status and peak effort required indicates that the most intense moment of effort required was particularly salient in defining retrospective discomfort for those at-risk for ADHD.

         Length of Task 
         We examined the correlation between length of the task (number of blocks) with each of our variables, including accuracy and ratings of effort and discomfort, both in the full sample and within each group. We found that length of task did not systematically vary with any of these variables in the full sample, in the control group or in the ADHD-risk group. 
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       In the current study, we examined individual differences in the experience of mental effort. Specifically, we asked participants at-risk for ADHD and participants not at-risk for ADHD to rate effort required and discomfort during a cognitively demanding task. We found that the ADHD-risk group reported higher levels of mental effort required (i.e., how taxed they felt) and discomfort during the PASAT working memory task, and these differences remained significant even after controlling for task performance. Individuals at-risk for ADHD were also less willing to do the working memory task again compared to the non-ADHD risk group. 
       The positive correlations observed between real-time ratings of effort and discomfort in both the ADHD-risk and control non-risk groups are consistent with the idea that the experience of effort is unpleasant and aversive ( Stanovich, 2009 ,  2011 ;  Kahneman, 2011 ;  Kurzban et al., 2013 ). Researchers have suggested that effortful tasks tend to trigger an unpleasant, aversive state because human cognitive system naturally seeks to minimize the expenditure of effort ( Kurzban et al., 2013 ). In this sense cognitive demands are evaluated as being costly and typically trigger avoidance coping behaviors ( Botvinick, 2007 ). Importantly, however, the experience of effort required was more strongly associated with discomfort for individuals at-risk for ADHD than for the non-risk group, as indicated by the significant difference in the size of the correlations between effort and discomfort ratings. Moreover, we found that average real-time effort and retrospective effort differed significantly in the at-risk and non-risk groups even after controlling for task performance. These findings are consistent with the theoretical literature in suggesting that the experience of a cognitively demanding task may be especially uncomfortable and effortful for individuals who struggle with ADHD-related difficulties ( Brown, 1996 ;  Sergeant, 2000 ;  Rucklidge and Tannock, 2002 ;  Van Liefferinge et al., 2016 ). In summary, individuals at-risk for ADHD experienced the working memory task to require more effort and to be more uncomfortable, even after controlling for task performance; and they also found the experience of effort and discomfort to be more strongly correlated. 
       The ADHD-risk group showed significant correlations between average real-time ratings of mental effort required and accuracy, but the non-risk group did not display significant correlations between average real-time effort required and performance accuracy. Similarly the ADHD risk group showed significant correlations between average real-time ratings of discomfort and accuracy, but the non-risk group did not display significant correlations between discomfort and accuracy. These differences between the at-risk and not at-risk groups were most pronounced for the hardest experimental conditions. Namely, in the hardest experimental conditions, the experience of effort required and discomfort were more tightly associated with actual performance accuracy for the at-risk group compared to the non-risk group. In contrast, in the hardest experimental conditions the perception of performance and actual accuracy were more tightly associated for the non-risk group compared to the at-risk group. Taken together, these results suggest the best subjective report for predicting actual performance on particularly challenging working memory tasks is perceived performance for the non-risk participants; whereas the at-risk participants are less accurate in their perception of how well they are doing. For the at-risk group, perceptions of performance and the experience of effort and discomfort were similarly related to actual accuracy. These sets of associations suggest that some type of moment-to-moment tracking of actual performance is happening during the task, but that what is being tracked may differ across groups. These intercorrelations among the effort, discomfort, perceived performance, and actual accuracy in each group may provide some further insights into understanding the differences between each group. 
       Peak real-time effort required was a significant predictor of retrospective discomfort in the ADHD-risk group but not in the non-risk group. Moreover, the interaction between ADHD group status and peak effort predicted retrospective discomfort, suggesting that the ADHD-risk group’s most intense experience of effort required was highly related to their memory of discomfort. That peak effort required interacted with ADHD-risk group status suggests that moments of peak effort are particularly significant and salient for individuals at-risk for ADHD and thus may be particularly defining for these individuals when they recall tasks (see review by  Fredrickson, 2000 ). We, however, did not find evidence to suggest that the final moments of a cognitively demanding task are differentially salient in determining task recollection for individuals at-risk of ADHD compared to those not at-risk. It may be that endings are equally salient for those at-risk for ADHD compared to those that are not at-risk. 
       In our view it will be fruitful to explore the  in the moment  experience of mental effort in a more nuanced manner, which disentangles subjective judgments of effort demanded ( how taxed I felt) , effort exerted ( how hard I tried) , and task difficulty ( how difficult the task is) . In particular, these distinctions will be useful to extend the ADHD literature, which has so far focused more on trait measures ( Brown, 1996 ;  Van Liefferinge et al., 2016 ) and on effort exerted in the moment ( Sergeant, 2000 ,  2005 ). We hope that our study provides a reference point for the utility of these distinctions in the experience of effort. In particular, the current findings suggest that individuals at-risk for ADHD may be characterized by differences in how taxed they feel during the completion of a cognitively demanding task, which is meaningfully separate from ratings of task difficulty and how hard one tries on a given task. Our research contributes to shifting emphasis from biomedical models that focus on the pathophysiology of disorders such as ADHD and to models that focus on the subjective experience and personal agency of the individual (e.g.,  Sonuga-Barke and Fairchild, 2012 ). Similarly, acknowledging the value and diagnosticity of an individual’s report of how demanding the task was is consistent with such a direction. 
       It is important to acknowledge that our study was based on a sample of university students, identifying at-risk and non-risk for ADHD groups. The proportion of at-risk individuals in our current study was quite high (31.6%) and considerably higher than prevalence rates of ADHD, which is closer to rates of 11% (DSM-5,  American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013 ) or 12% ( Kessler et al., 2007 ). However, our proportion of at-risk participants is in line with other studies that have used the ASRS as a screening tool in undergraduate samples for ADHD symptoms (24% such as  Turel and Bechara, 2016 ). We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our study and that future studies will be needed in order to bridge our current findings with the ADHD literature. A critical step will be to examine these measures in a clinically referred sample of children, adolescents and adults with diagnosed ADHD. Studying the experience of mental effort will provide novel ways to assess the challenges of these individuals, and to develop new directions to assess and intervene for these individuals. The more precise language for describing the ways that tasks impact the individual, which we are advocating here has the promise to help develop better strategies for the individual to master tasks that they may find tedious and uninteresting. For example, thinking of effort as a fluid quality that is malleable and under the control of the individual, rather than fixed and defined by the parameters of the task, may offer promising directions to support students with ADHD who struggle academically. Such an approach is very much in line with current mindset interventions for targeting academic underachievement, such as growth mindset programs ( Paunesku et al., 2015 ). 
       In this study, individuals at-risk for ADHD rated the task as requiring more effort than the ADHD non-risk group. The group differences in ratings of effort required and discomfort remained significant after controlling for accuracy. For individuals who avoid effortful tasks, there may be a unique affective association that negatively tags their experience of effort, possibly impacting their motivation for future tasks. Given that many theories of mental effort postulate that the experience of being mentally taxed may serve as a regulatory signal to disengage from effortful tasks (e.g.,  Kurzban, 2016 ), investigating the experience of mental effort demanded during the completion of a cognitively demanding task in individuals with ADHD-related difficulties would provide a productive line of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the regulation of effort exerted in at-risk samples.

          Francisella tularensis  is able to invade, survive and replicate inside a variety of cell types. However,  in vivo F. tularensis  preferentially enters host macrophages where it rapidly escapes to the cytosol to avoid phagosomal stresses and to multiply to high numbers. We previously showed that human monocyte infection by  F. tularensis  LVS triggered deglycosylation of the glutamine transporter SLC1A5. However, this deglycosylation, specifically induced by  Francisella  infection, was not restricted to SLC1A5, suggesting that host protein deglycosylation processes in general might contribute to intracellular bacterial adaptation. Indeed, we later found that  Francisella  infection modulated the transcription of numerous glycosidase and glycosyltransferase genes in human macrophages and analysis of cell extracts revealed an important increase of N and O-protein glycosylation. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation has significant effects on protein folding, conformation, distribution, stability, and activity and dysfunction of protein glycosylation may lead to development of diseases like cancer and pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Pathogenic bacteria have also evolved dedicated glycosylation machineries and have notably been shown to use these glycoconjugates as ligands to specifically interact with the host. In this review, we will focus on  Francisella  and summarize our current understanding of the importance of these post-translational modifications on its intracellular niche adaptation.

       Introduction 
       Protein glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins, as present in all kingdoms of life. It consists in the covalent attachment of glycans onto amino acid side chains, this reaction being catalyzed by an enzyme. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation has significant effects on protein folding, conformation, distribution, stability, and activity. Particularly, the sugar chains of glycoproteins are essential for maintaining the order of intercellular interactions among all differentiated cells in multicellular organisms. Therefore, alterations in the sugar chains may range from being essentially undetectable to a complete loss in particular functions (Varki,  1993 ). Indeed, dysfunction of protein glycosylation may lead to development of diseases like cancer and pathogenesis of infectious diseases (Moran et al.,  2011 ). In the innate immune system, which is the major actor for protection against microbial pathogens, several host glycoproteins have been shown to function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), involved in pathogen binding (Di Gioia and Zanoni,  2015 ). Cell-surface glycoproteins facing the extracellular environment are ideally located to facilitate this host–pathogen interaction. The receptors of the innate immune response i.e., Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD-like) receptors (NLRs) are glycoproteins. In the adaptative immune response, the major components, which include class I and class II major histocompatibility complex proteins, chemokine and cytokine receptors, and essentially all cytokines and chemokines are glycosylated (Opdenakker et al.,  2016 ). 
       Bacterial pathogens have also evolved dedicated glycosylation machineries. When compared to higher organisms, bacteria are capable of producing an extraordinary amount of unique and diverse glycans, which are principally attached to the cell surface, and secreted molecules. Bacteria are able to use these glycoconjugates as a range of unique and specific ligands, which specifically interact with the host (Tytgat and de Vos,  2016 ). Bacteria are covered with various types of carbohydrate moieties. These surface-exposed bacterial structures are often called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (or PAMPS). 
       Oligosaccharides may either mediate “specific recognition” events or provide “modulation” of biological processes. For example, they may allow interaction of bacterial proteins with host-derived proteins or they may modulate bacteria- and/or host-related events (Bastos et al.,  2017 ). All these events may be essential for bacterial colonization, its survival and the subsequent infection. Therefore, host immunization may be dependent on these PTM, whether mediated by the pathogen or by the host. 
        Francisella tularensis  is a Gram-negative bacterium causing the zoonotic disease tularemia in a number of mammalian species, including humans (Sjöstedt,  2011 ).  F. tularensis  invades, survives and replicates inside a variety of cell types, including phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells of various species (Meibom and Charbit,  2010 ), as well as arthropod-derived cells (Santic et al.,  2010 ). “ In vivo ,”  F. tularensis  preferentially enters host macrophages (Clemens et al.,  2005 ), rapidly escapes to the cytosol where it actively multiplies (Case et al.,  2014 ). While the cytoplasm was initially considered as a safe nutrient-replete haven (Ray et al.,  2009 ), it is now clearly established that the host cytosol may be a harsh environment by depriving nutrients against invading bacteria (Abu Kwaik and Bumann,  2013 ; Zhang and Rubin,  2013 ). Conversely, invading intracellular pathogens may also “steal” nutrients of the host cell that, in turn, needs to adapt its metabolism to control its cytosolic content (Barel et al.,  2015 ). Indeed, upon addition of gluconeogenic substrates, such as oaxaloacetate and pyruvate, to the cell culture medium increased intracellular multiplication of  F. tularensis  LVS was observed, suggesting that these nutrients served as sources of glucose to feed multiplying bacteria. 
       We will herein summarize what is known about the glycosylation-deglycosylation processes occurring during  Francisella  infection, as observed from either the host or the pathogen. 
     
     
       Host point of view 
        Francisella  infection modifies numerous “glyco-genes” involved in glycosylation pathways in human macrophages. Indeed, using a glycan processing gene microarray (Chacko et al.,  2011 ), we observed significant changes in the level of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase gene expression profiles in human THP-1 monocytes, infected for 24 h with  F. tularensis  LVS (Barel et al.,  2016 ). Expression of eight genes, encoding four glycosyltransferases and four glycosidases, was down-regulated upon infection. These four glycosidase belonged to the EDEM family, which is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The expression of six genes was up-regulated upon infection, corresponding to five glycosyltransferases and one glycosidase. The up-regulated glycosyltransferases were involved either in  N -glycosylation or in  O -glycosylation of glycoproteins. The glycosidase gene whose expression was up-regulated, encoded the glycosidase HEXA, which is involved in the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) (Vaidyanathan et al.,  2014 ). 
       Glycosylation occurred as soon as 1 h after entry of the bacteria into the cells. Only three proteins were found and characterized as carrying potential  N -glycosylation residues, while nine proteins contained potential  O -glycosylation residues. Among them, we characterized BiP/GRP78/HSPA5 protein, a member of the HSP70 heat shock protein family. BiP expression was increased both at transcription and translation level, by  F. tularensis  LVS infection immediately after binding to the cells. BiP glycosylation was also induced at early stage of infection. BiP being a key regulator of the UPR (Ni et al.,  2009 ; Pfaffenbach and Lee,  2011 ), we hypothesized that the glycosylation-deglycosylation processes could be modified by  Francisella . This could result in direct triggering of the UPR (including BiP) in infected cells with a decrease of the load of newly synthesized “abnormal” proteins. In addition, among the nine proteins containing potential O-glycosylation residues and being glycosylated by  Francisella  infection, we also found PRKCSH, the beta-subunit of glucosidase 2. This enzyme is acting upstream BiP, in the calnexin pathway, which is also involved in correcting misfolded proteins (Hetz et al.,  2011 ). 
       Infection of human monocytes by  F. tularensis  LVS also triggered the deglycosylation of the glycosylated amino acid transporter SLC1A5 and other glycoproteins (Barel et al.,  2012 ). Deglycosylation induced by  F. tularensis  LVS was maximum at 24 h when intracellular multiplication occurred and depended on the capacity of the bacteria to escape from the phagosomes (Barel et al.,  2012 ). It was not an inhibition of glycosylation since tunicamycine had no inhibiting effect on this deglycosylation. 
       The enzymes involved in these glycosylation-deglycosylation mechanisms are still not characterized. 
       We tried to summarize the cascade of events triggered upon infection of macrophages by  Francisella  in the hypothetical model depicted in Figure  1 . The transporter SLC1A5 was chosen as a prototypic glycosylated membrane protein. After its synthesis and translocation into the ER, the protein is transported to the Golgi where it is first glycosylated ➀ and, from there, addressed to the membrane via secretory vesicles. In the plasma membrane, SLC1A5 is present only as a glycosylated protein ➁ (Console et al.,  2015 ). Upon re-entry into the cytoplasm via endocytosis, glycosylated SLC1A5 becomes available to glucosidases ➂ such as HEXA (whose expression is induced upon  Francisella  infection). The deglycosylated form of SLC1A5 has been indeed localized only in the cytoplasm (Console et al.,  2015 ). This deglycosylated form of the protein (possibly misfolded) could trigger increase of BiP expression and its glycosylation ➃. 
       
         Figure 1 
         
            SLC1A5 is glycosylated after passage into the Golgi ① and is exported to the membrane ② . Its endocytosis into the cytoplasm renders it available to glucosidases ➂, e.g., HEXA, whose transcription level is increased upon  Francisella  infection. The deglycosylated form of SLC1A5 has been indeed localized only in the cytoplasm. In turn, these deglycosylated (and possibly misfolded) proteins could trigger the increase of BiP expression and its glycosylation ➃. 
         
         
       
       It is tempting to suggest that the intracellular survival of  Francisella  would be favored both by the control exerted on the UPR response of the host and by the availability of free oligosaccharides resulting from deglycosylation processes, that could serve as nutrients. 
     
     
       Pathogen point of view 
       A large number of bacterial proteins have been found to be glycosylated (Tan et al.,  2015 ). They show a surprising degree of diversity, both within and between bacterial species. Protein glycosylation can be classified according to the glycosidic linkage. Attachment to the amide nitrogen of asparagine (Asn) is known as  N- glycosylation, with that of serine or threonine (Ser/Thr) to the hydroxyl oxygen being known as  O- glycosylation.  N-  and  O- linked glycosylation may occur either through the action of an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) or via the action of glycosyltransferases (GTs). OSTs substrates are lipid-linked oligosaccharides while the GTs substrates are usually nucleotide-activated sugars. It was only very recently (Dankova et al.,  2016 ) that the glycosylation machinery of  Francisella  was found to involve a variety of sugar biogenesis enzymes, glycosyltransferases, a flippase, and a protein-targeting oligosaccharyltransferase. As both type A and type B strains of  F. tularensis  subspecies expressed an  O -linked protein glycosylation system, which utilizes core biosynthetic and assembly pathways,  O -linked protein glycosylation may be a feature common to members of the  Francisella  genus (Egge-Jacobsen et al.,  2011 ). 
       The initial attempts to elucidate the glycan repertoire of  Francisella  and their structures had failed because of the enzymatic and chemical release techniques used. Some proteins were found after transcriptional profiling of mutants. Indeed, FTT_0905 was characterized as a glycosylated Type IV pili protein, which is transcriptionally regulated by MglA. As MglA controls the expression of the  Francisella  pathogenicity island, FTT_0905 was considered as a new virulence factor (Brotcke et al.,  2006 ). However, by mapping the glycoproteome of the FSC200 strain of  F. tularensis  subsp.  holarctica , several candidate proteins were found that could be target for glycosylation as DsbA (FTH_1071), an uncharacterized protein FTH_0069, FopA, Tul4, and LemA (Balonova et al.,  2010 ). In contrast, the PglA protein was identified as a targeting oligosaccharyltransferase because it is necessary for PilA glycosylation in  F. tularensis  (Egge-Jacobsen et al.,  2011 ). Indeed, this protein undergoes multisite O-linked glycosylation, with a pentasaccharide of the structure HexNac-Hex-Hex-HexNac-HexNac. PglA is highly conserved in  Francisell a genus, supporting the general feature of  O -glycosylation. Then, the detailed characterization of the DsbA glycan and the putative role of the FTT0789–FTT0800 gene cluster in glycan biosynthesis were reported (Thomas et al.,  2011 ). Indeed, these authors observed that the essential virulence factor DsbA migrated as multiple protein spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. The protein was modified with a 1,156-Da glycan moiety in O-linkage. The glycan is a hexasaccharide, comprised of N-acetylhexosamines, hexoses, and an unknown monosaccharide. Loss of DsbA glycan modification was obtained by disruption of two genes within the  FTT0789 – FTT0800  putative polysaccharide locus, including a  galE  homolog ( FTT0791 ) and one gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase ( FTT0798 ). As the mutants remained virulent in the murine model of subcutaneous tularemia, it indicated that glycosylation of DsbA does not play a major role in virulence under these conditions (Thomas et al.,  2011 ). When defining the previously uncharacterized FTH_0069 protein as a novel glycosylated lipoprotein required for virulence, Balonova et al. ( 2012 ) also showed that the glycan structure modifying its two C-terminal peptides was identical to that of DsbA glycoprotein, as well as to one of the multiple glycan structures modifying the type IV pilin PilA. They therefore suggested a common biosynthetic pathway for the protein modification and a relationship between synthesis of the  O -antigen and the glycan in the early steps of their biosynthetic pathways. Indeed, the  pglA  gene, encoding pilin oligosaccharyl transferase PglA, was involved in both pilin and general  F. tularensis  protein glycosylation. 
       In another study on activation of pulmonary inflammation after  F. tularensis  Schu S4 exposure (Walters et al.,  2013 ), altered expression level of bacteria-specific mRNA transcripts was found. Among these transcripts, a hypothetical protein FTT_0797 was characterized which shared homology with a glycosyl transferase. This protein is part of a gene cluster, which is thought to encode a polysaccharide additional to the lipopolysaccharide O antigen. Another protein, encoded by  FTS_1402 , was found to be involved in glycoprotein synthesis and to also contribute in part to LPS/capsule and/or Capsule Like Complex (CLC) production (Dankova et al.,  2016 ). The resulting  FTS_1402  mutant presented more sensitivity to serum complement. 
       All these proteins are summarized in Table  1 .

       Role of post-translational modifications (PTM) on bacteria/host cell proteins 
       While two-third of all eukaryotic proteins are estimated to be glycosylated, the number of prokaryotic glycoproteins is still way behind understanding. This is mainly due to the enormous variability of their glycan structures and variations in the underlying glycosylation processes. In 2016, Schäffer and and Messner ( 2016 ) combined glycan structural information with bioinformatic, genetic, biochemical and enzymatic data for in-depth analyses of glycosylation processes in prokaryotes. This study included the major classes of prokaryotic (i.e., bacterial and archaeal) glycoconjugates without any example on  Francisella . Furthermore, in a very recent publication (Bastos et al.,  2017 ), while  F. tularensis  was shown to exhibit the largest number of glycoproteins in common with  M. tuberculosis  ( Mtb ), by sharing 16% of its glycoproteome, none of the glycosylated proteins of  Francisella , as well as none of the enzymes involved in glycosylation pathway, have been found to play a specific role in pathogenesis. At the opposite, in  M. tuberculosis , glycosylation of HbN, a truncated hemoglobin protein, was demonstrated to be necessary for its maintainance at the bacterial membrane and wall (Arya et al.,  2013 ). Mutation in its mannose glycan linkage disrupted the facilitation of  Mtb  and  M. smegmatis  entry within the macrophages. These data suggested that glycosylation processes allowed  Mtb  survival within the hazardous environment of macrophages and the establishment of long term persistent infection in the host (Dey and Bishai,  2014 ). 
       Of note,  Francisella  did not belong to the list of prokaryotes that catalyzed glycosylation of host cell proteins (Bastos et al.,  2017 ). In contrast,  Legionella  was cited as targeting eEF1A through effect of the glucosyl transferase Lgt1, with as result, the killing of eukaryotic cells (Belyi et al.,  2008 ). 
     
     
       Conclusion 
       While 146 examples of protein glycosylation were cited for  Francisella  and only 111 for  Helicobacter  pylori (Bastos et al.,  2017 ), the importance of these PTM, observed in  Francisella  and those induced in the host, is still largely unknown, notably on the outcome of the infectious cycle. Indeed, a large correlation between glycosylation and bacterial pathogenicity has already been proven for various species e.g.,  Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella  and enteropathogenic  Escherichia coli  (EPEC) (Lu et al.,  2015 ). 
        Francisella  infection modifies the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Barel et al.,  2016 ) and manipulates autophagy (Miller and Celli,  2016 ). Both processes are involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and helping destroy invading microorganisms. Glycosylation and deglycosylation could be involved in molecular mimicry of common host cell glycans therefore helping the bacteria to avoid immune recognition. At this stage, we have all the reasons to believe that the glycosylation-deglycosylation processes observed in THP-1 cells were originated from eukaryotic enzymes. However, we cannot formerly exclude that  Francisella  enzymes might also be involved. Glycans and glycan-binding receptors influence all stages of infection, starting from initial colonization of host epithelial surfaces to spreading in tissue and inducing inflammation or host-cell injury, which may results in clinical symptoms (Nizet and Esko,  2009 ). Therefore, knowledge of glycosylation pathways involved during  Francisella  infection remains fundamental for prevention and treatment strategies.

         The majority of research in the  Staphylococcus  field has been dedicated to the understanding of  Staphylococcus aureus  infections. In contrast, there is limited information on infections by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and how the host responds to them.  S. epidermidis , a member of the coagulase-negative Staphylococci, is an important commensal organism of the human skin and mucous membranes; and there is emerging evidence of its benefit for human health in fighting off harmful microorganisms. However,  S. epidermidis  can cause opportunistic infections, which include particularly biofilm-associated infections on indwelling medical devices. These often can disseminate into the bloodstream; and in fact,  S. epidermidis  is the most frequent cause of nosocomial sepsis. The increasing use of medical implants and the dramatic shift in the patient demographic population in recent years have contributed significantly to the rise of  S. epidermidis  infections. Furthermore, treatment has been complicated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Today,  S. epidermidis  is a major nosocomial pathogen posing significant medical and economic burdens. In this review, we present the current understanding of mechanisms of host defense against the prototypical CoNS species  S. epidermidis  as a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, and during biofilm-associated infection and sepsis.

       Introduction 
       Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a heterogeneous group of staphylococcal species classified clinically by the absence of the blood-clotting enzyme coagulase. This distinguishes them from  Staphylococcus aureus  and a few clinically less important coagulase-positive species. Today, CoNS are the most commonly isolated bacteria in clinical cultures and have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens. Risk factors for CoNS infection include the presence of indwelling medical implants, such as intravascular catheters, or immunosuppression due to cancer treatment or HIV/AIDS. Treatment of CoNS infections is complicated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (such as particularly MRSE, methicillin-resistant  S. epidermidis ) (Rogers et al.,  2009 ). 
       CoNS are an integral part of the normal flora on the human skin and mucous membranes, and preferentially colonize moist areas (Grice et al.,  2009 ).  S. epidermidis , the most common CoNS species recovered from clinical cultures, colonizes the armpit, groin, anterior nares, conjunctiva, toe webs, and perineal area (Kloos and Musselwhite,  1975 ). While usually innocuous or even beneficial colonizers, once the host epithelial barrier is compromised, CoNS such as  S. epidermidis  can cause serious infections. In fact, CoNS infections account for the majority of bacterial sepsis and foreign body-related infections, with  S. epidermidis  being the most significant species in that regard (Rogers et al.,  2009 ). 
       The host immune response to  S. epidermidis , the mechanism of immune tolerance, and the immune benefits that  S. epidermidis  commensals can provide, are just beginning to be unraveled. This review will provide the latest research on the host response to  S. epidermidis  as commensals, and as opportunistic bacteria in the context of biofilm and septic infections. 
     
     
       The host immune response to  S. epidermidis  as a commensal 
       There is increasing evidence that the skin microbiota in general have an important impact on the immune system (Belkaid and Tamoutounour,  2016 ). Despite CoNS being among the most important skin colonizers, specific studies on the host immune response to CoNS colonization and establishment have been limited. Those that are available have focused on the immune response to skin colonization by the prototypical CoNS species  S. epidermidis  and the benefits such colonization provides to the host. 
       For example, the Gallo group has described potentially beneficial functions of  S. epidermidis  as a skin commensal. Namely, Lai et al. reported that  S. epidermidis  lipoteichoic acid (LTA) through a mechanism involving TLR (toll-like receptor) 2 reduces skin inflammation (Lai et al.,  2009 ). The same authors also later reported that  S. epidermidis  (but not other bacteria) produces a not further characterized substance of less than 10 kD that activates TLR2, and thereby induces antimicrobial peptide production, which increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit growth of group A  Streptococcus  and  S. aureus  (Lai et al.,  2010 ) (Figure  1A ). While these results underline a beneficial function of  S. epidermidis  on the skin, regarding the stimulating factor, they have to be seen in light of the fact that the frequently reported activation of TLR2 by LTA has been challenged: LTA purification is extremely difficult and often contains TLR2-stimulating lipopeptide contaminants, including in commercial preparations (Hashimoto et al.,  2006 ). These findings thus certainly require further assessment using isogenic mutants of  S. epidermidis  to verify the nature of the stimulating factor. 
       
         Figure 1 
         
            Model of the host response to  S. epidermidis  colonization (A) 
 S. epidermidis  colonizes the skin epidermis, a highly organized structure composed mainly of keratinocytes. In response to  S. epidermidis  colonization, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLR2 on keratinocytes bind to poorly characterized factor(s) secreted by  S. epidermidis  to stimulate a signaling cascade that results, for example, in the production of the antimicrobial peptides β-defensin 2 (hBD2) and hBD3. These antimicrobial peptides provide protection from cutaneous  S. aureus  and Group A  Streptococcus  infections.  (B) 
 S. epidermidis  colonization induces a specific CD4 +  FOXP3 +  T reg  response, which is essential for immune tolerance toward  S. epidermidis  as a commensal. Immune tolerance is believed to be established only during the neonatal period, as colonization in adult mice failed to establish tolerance.  (C)  In a different model, based on results obtained in adult mice, skin colonization by  S. epidermidis  triggers a specific IL-17A +  CD8 +  T-cell response. Primed in the skin draining lymph node by CD103 +  dendritic cells, these T cells enhance the innate antimicrobial defense and prevent invasion by the fungus,  C. albicans . 
         
         
       
       Scharschmidt et al. showed that colonization with  S. epidermidis  triggered a local, as well as systemic, specific CD4 +  T cell response as demonstrated by the enrichment of specific CD4 +  T cells in both the skin-draining lymph nodes and the spleen (Scharschmidt et al.,  2015 ). This group engineered the  S. epidermidis  skin isolate, strain Tü3298, to express the peptide antigen 2W (Epi-2W) linked to a fluorescent protein. To achieve colonization, they applied 10 8 –10 9  CFUs of the engineered Epi-2W strain to the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice every 3 days for a total of three applications. Using this model, the authors illustrated that expansion of specifically CD4 +  regulatory T (T reg ) cells plays a critical role in the immune tolerance to  S. epidermidis . Such tolerance, however, required early bacterial colonization during the neonatal stage, as colonization in adult mice did not establish tolerance (Figure  1B ). The work by Scharschmidt et al. is especially intriguing as it provides the scientific rationale for the modulation of the skin microbiota in the neonatal period as a therapeutic option to treat inflammatory skin diseases, and in particular, for atopic dermatitis (AD). 
       The skin of AD patients is often colonized by  S. aureus  (Higaki et al.,  1999 ). Several studies show that  S. epidermidis  is the second most common microbe isolated from AD-affected skin lesions (Hon et al.,  2005 ,  2012 ,  2016 ). While this does not directly implicate  S. epidermidis  in the pathogenesis of AD, due to its normal and frequent abundance on the skin, in the most recent of those studies, Hon  et al . examined bacterial isolates from 100 AD patients and found that  S. epidermidis  is present in the most severely AD-affected skin lesions (Hon et al.,  2016 ). Thus, the previously suggested antagonistic relationship between  S. epidermidis  and  S. aureus  (Cogen et al.,  2010 ; Iwase et al.,  2010 ), did not translate to less disease in their study. Rather, the results suggested that  S. epidermidis  colonization is associated with more severe AD disease. Certainly, further studies are required to evaluate the role of  S. epidermidis  in AD pathogenesis and the nature of the relationship between  S. aureus  and  S. epidermidis  in AD lesions. 
       Naik et al. demonstrated that  S. epidermidis  colonization in adult mice induces a skin-specific T cell response (Naik et al.,  2015 ). In this study, the group applied ~5 ml of 10 7 –10 9  CFU per ml of  S. epidermidis  across the entire mouse skin surface every other day for a total of four applications, a procedure by which they reported to obtain stable colonization. The T cells induced in this study, however, were IL-17A +  CD8 +  T cells rather than CD4 +  T cells, as in the Scharschmidt et al. study (Scharschmidt et al.,  2015 ). The authors showed that these IL-17A +  CD8 +  T cells provided immunity to cutaneous  C. albicans  infection (Figure  1C ); however, they did not examine whether this also provides immunity to other pathogens, notably  S. aureus  (Naik et al.,  2015 ). 
       Both the Scharschmidt et al. and Naik et al. studies examined the host immune response to  S. epidermidis  colonization, yet their findings are quite different. These differences can be attributed to the nuances in the setup of the mouse models or possibly also the specific  S. epidermidis  strains used. Despite the differences in the results, collectively, the two studies showed that colonization with  S. epidermidis  induces an adaptive T cell response in mice. It is unclear, however, if such immune signature to  S. epidermidis  colonization is also observed in humans. 
     
     
       Immunity against  S. epidermidis  in biofilm-associated infections 
       Very few studies have been performed to assess the immune response to CoNS biofilm-associated infections, especially as compared to  S. aureus . Most of those studies have focused on  S. epidermidis . CoNS biofilm-associated infections often occur in patients with medical implants, with  S. epidermidis  being the most likely species to be recovered (Rogers et al.,  2009 ). Biofilms are complex, spatially diverse agglomerations of bacterial cells enclosed within an amorphous, self-produced extracellular matrix composed of extracellular DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides (Otto,  2008 ). Biofilm-associated infections are extremely resistant to antibiotic treatment for several reasons, including reduced metabolism and hampered penetration through the extracellular matrix (Mah and O'Toole,  2001 ). Consequently, treatment often requires surgical removal of the infected device or tissue. In the US alone, approximately $ 2 billion is spent annually for the treatment and management of orthopedic implant-related infections (Darouiche,  2004 ; Parvizi et al.,  2010 ). 
       In general, the host immune response to an  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infection is not protective or sufficient to clear the infection. Hence, most  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infections are chronic. Most studies conducted on the subject thus far are  in-vitro  studies that have compared biofilm-grown versus planktonic bacteria. Results from several studies suggest that  S. epidermidis  biofilms induce attenuation in phagocytic function and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines when compared to their planktonic counterparts (Figure  2 ). Conflicting findings have been reported on the effects of  S. epidermidis  biofilms on phagocytic activity. Two studies reported that adherence and phagocytosis by human neutrophils and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were significantly enhanced when stimulated with biofilm-grown bacteria (Heinzelmann et al.,  1997 ; Spiliopoulou et al.,  2012 ), while others reported that the biofilm exopolysaccharide, polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) (Mack et al.,  1996 ) plays an essential role in the attenuation of phagocytic capacity of murine peritoneal macrophages (Shiau and Wu,  1998 ), J774A.1 murine macrophages (Schommer et al.,  2011 ), and human PMNs. There is consensus in the literature, however, with regard to the effects of  S. epidermidis  biofilm on phagocytic killing. Killing by human macrophages (Spiliopoulou et al.,  2012 ) and PMNs (Vuong et al.,  2004 ; Kristian et al.,  2008 ) as well as antibody-mediated killing by leukocytes (Cerca et al.,  2006 ) are strongly attenuated in the presence of biofilm-grown bacteria. 
       
         Figure 2 
         
            Model of the host response to  S. epidermidis  infections . Breaching through the skin can result in  S. epidermidis  dissemination into the bloodstream to cause bacteremia and acute cases of sepsis. Host immunity against septic infections heavily depends on neutrophils, complement, as well as activation of PRRs including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as TLR2 (green) and FPR2 (blue). Biofilm-associated infections on medical implants originate from contaminations during device insertion or, in rare cases, from the bloodstream. Patients with medical implants are susceptible to  S. epidermidis  sepsis, as biofilm bacteria can often disseminate into the bloodstream. The immune response to biofilm-associated infections is generally thought to be not effective, as biofilms inhibit phagocytic killing by PMNs and macrophages. In addition, they skew the immune system toward enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-13 while limiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL1-beta, IL-12, and IFN-gamma. 
         
         
       
       The role of complement in CoNS biofilm-associated infections is quite unclear. While  S. epidermidis  biofilm-producing strains elicit a stronger response in the activation and release of complement components than their isogenic PIA-negative and thus biofilm-negative counterparts (Kristian et al.,  2008 ; Fredheim et al.,  2011 ), such complement release did not translate to enhanced phagocytic killing.  S. epidermidis  PIA-positive biofilms triggered C3a release, but protected  S. epidermidis  from C3b and IgG opsonization and PMN-mediated killing (Kristian et al.,  2008 ). Notably—while some authors tried to attribute specific effects to PIA, rather than biofilm formation, by mechanically destroying aggregates (Vuong et al.,  2004 ), in none of these studies a clear distinction between the effects of biofilm agglomerations and a direct effect of the exopolysaccharide PIA can be made. As for the claimed pro-inflammatory properties of PIA (Kristian et al.,  2008 ; Fredheim et al.,  2011 ; Ferreirinha et al.,  2016 ), the facts that PIA is a difficult-to-purify substance and isogenic PIA-negative mutants have distinctly different cell surface properties, makes it difficult to attribute observed effects directly to the PIA molecule. 
       It has been reported that  S. epidermidis  biofilm-grown strains elicit production of anti-inflammatory rather than pro-inflammatory cytokines (Spiliopoulou et al.,  2012 ). In the respective study, primary human monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with live  S. epidermidis  from 24-h biofilms produced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-12) and elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13 than planktonic cells grown for 2 h. Obviously, in that comparison other factors, such as most notably quorum-sensing-regulated pro-inflammatory factors such as the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) (Cheung et al.,  2014 ) discussed below, may be made responsible for the observed differences rather than biofilm formation itself. However, comparing biofilm-positive with isogenic biofilm-negative (PIA-negative, Embp, or Aap-negative) strains, Schommer et al. also observed a reduced inflammatory response in 774A.1 macrophages with reduced NF-kappaB activation and reduced IL-1beta production (Schommer et al.,  2011 ). 
       Little is known about how the adaptive immune system responds to biofilm-associated infections, in part, because it is difficult to establish long-term  S. epidermidis  biofilm infection models. Vuong et al. have developed a catheter-related murine infection model with a  S. epidermidis  bioluminescent strain called SE Xen43, with which they were able to monitor in real-time the progression of  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infection (Vuong et al.,  2008 ). Comparing the susceptibility of Nu/Nu (T cell-deficient) and CBSCBG-MM (T/B cell-deficient) to  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infection with immuno-competent wild-type Balb/C mice, the authors found that in particular the Nu/Nu mice were more susceptible to infection, indicating an important role of T cell-mediated immunity against  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infection. 
     
     
       Immunity against  S. epidermidis  during sepsis 
       The presence of CoNS in the blood (bacteremia), often originating from the dispersal of bacteria from biofilms on indwelling medical devices, can cause acute sepsis (Figure  2 ). CoNS bacteremia is associated with significant healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality (Bearman and Wenzel,  2005 ). Immune-compromised and premature neonates are the most vulnerable to CoNS sepsis with  S. epidermidis  being the most prevalent CoNS species involved (Cheung and Otto,  2010 ). 
       In contrast to  S. epidermidis  biofilm-associated infections, which are chronic,  S. epidermidis  sepsis is acute by nature. Therefore, the host immune response to  S. epidermidis  sepsis, which takes place largely in the bloodstream, is quite different from that against tissue-residing  S. epidermidis  biofilm associated-infections. Since neonates have increased susceptibility to  S. epidermidis  sepsis, most of the studies on the matter dealt with  S. epidermidis  neonatal sepsis. Therefore, the following discussion will be focused on neonatal immunity in response to S.  epidermidis  sepsis. 
       An important element in the innate immune response are innate immune cells, among which neutrophils dominate in number. Neutrophils recognize invading microbes via a repertoire of host receptors (see below), ingest them, and eliminate them within the phagosome by reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial proteins released during a process called degranulation (Malech et al.,  2014 ). In addition, lysed neutrophils can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to bind and kill invading microbes (Brinkmann et al.,  2004 ). 
       Several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize and bind to conserved microbial products (PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and play an essential role in the activation of the innate immune response, have been shown to be critical in host immunity against  S. epidermidis  sepsis. TLR2 was shown to be critical for clearance of  S. epidermidis  in a mouse sepsis model (Strunk et al.,  2010 ). In human neonates, there is an increase in TLR2 expression over the course of  S. epidermidis  sepsis (Viemann et al.,  2005 ), however, a TLR-stimulated immune system was reported to be less proficient in eliciting multiple cytokine responses in neonates compared to adults (Kollmann et al.,  2009 ).  S. epidermidis  PIA (Stevens et al.,  2009 ), PSMs (Hajjar et al.,  2001 ), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Xia et al.,  2016 ) have been claimed to be effectors of TLR2. However, studies with PIA and PSMs were not verified with isogenic mutants; and as for LTA, there has been recent evidence indicating that staphylococcal lipopeptides rather than LTA are the real immune-stimulatory agents (Hashimoto et al.,  2006 ). Furthermore, in  S. aureus  it was shown that PSMs are not direct agonists of TLR2, but lead to the release of lipopeptides from the cell surface and thus have a secondary, TLR2-stimulatory effect (Hanzelmann et al.,  2016 ), an effect likely also present in  S. epidermidis . 
       Based on the fact that the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) recognizes PSMs (Kretschmer et al.,  2010 ), this G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor is another potentially important host receptor in the response against  S. epidermidis . As shown in  S. aureus , PSM-FPR2 activation induces chemotaxis, granule exocytosis, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) release from PMNs (Wang et al.,  2007 ; Kretschmer et al.,  2010 ). Studies on the effects of PSMs of CoNS on the immune response have only been performed with pure PSMs of  S. epidermidis  (Cheung et al.,  2010 ), and so far have been hampered by the multitude of genetic  psm  loci in  S. epidermidis  and the general difficulty to produce isogenic deletion mutants in CoNS. However, a recent study attributed a crucial role to the mobile genetic-element-encoded, highly produced PSM-mec of  S. epidermidis  in inflammation and immune evasion, using isogenic  psm-mec  mutants (Qin et al.,  2017 ). 
       Complement also plays an important role in the immunity against  S. epidermidis  sepsis. Deficiencies in complement factor C3 and IgG are associated with a higher risk of neonatal CoNS-associated sepsis (Lassiter et al.,  1991 ). Furthermore, in a study using an  ex-vivo  whole-blood sepsis model,  S. epidermidis  induced significantly lower complement activation in neonatal compared to adult blood (Granslo et al.,  2013 ). This finding suggests that there is a maturational deficiency in the neonatal complement system, which, in part, may explain why neonates are more susceptible to  S. epidermidis  septic infections than adults. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of the complement system in the host defense against  S. epidermidis  sepsis. 
       Like complement, neutrophils of preterm neonates display maturational deficiency. They show an impaired oxidative burst compared to those isolated from term newborns when stimulated with  S. epidermidis  (Björkqvist et al.,  2004 ). This, in part, may also explain the increased susceptibility in preterm neonates to  S. epidermidis  sepsis. Interestingly enough, monocytes, another cellular component in the innate immune response, are not essential to the host defense against neonatal  S. epidermidis  sepsis as both human neonatal and adult monocytes displayed similar phagocytic and intracellular killing capacity (Strunk et al.,  2007 ). Taken together, this indicates that neutrophils play a particularly important role in the immune response during  S. epidermidis  sepsis. 
       While there are numerous studies dedicated to understanding the role of the innate immune response during  S. epidermidis  sepsis, research on the role of the adaptive immune response in  S. epidermidis  septic infections remains limited. As these infections are acute in nature, it is unlikely that the adaptive immune response plays a significant role. Accordingly, intravenous transfer of immunoglobulin from donors with high titers of antibodies to  S. epidermidis  or  S. aureus  failed to protect from sepsis in preterm newborns (Bloom et al.,  2005 ; DeJonge et al.,  2007 ). 
     
     
       Conclusions 
       CoNS infections and in particular  S. epidermidis  pose a significant medical and economic burden to public healthcare. Furthermore, with the emergence of antibiotic resistance, treatment options are becoming limited. However, the elimination of  S. epidermidis  bacteria appears inappropriate, as they are an integral part of the beneficial microbiota on the skin and mucous membranes. 
       The beneficial role of  S. epidermidis  colonization in the prevention of pathogen overgrowth on the skin, based on results in mice, has been attributed to stimulation of the immune response. However, with the mouse skin model barely reflecting the situation on human skin, it remains poorly understood whether the findings are transferable to humans. Furthermore, whether there is a role of potential direct bacterial interaction between  S. epidermidis  and pathogens on the skin remains to be investigated. 
       The immune response to  S. epidermidis  during infection possibly is even less well understood. In chronic, biofilm-associated infection it is difficult to distinguish between effects of shear agglomeration and those mediated by specific cell surface components. During sepsis, the nature and role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation pathways in response to  S. epidermidis  remains equally poorly defined. Elucidation of these mechanisms will also provide more information on the question why neonates are particularly susceptible to  S. epidermidis  infection. Progress that has been made regarding molecular biology tools for  S. epidermidis  and CoNS in general will be of great help in these endeavors and especially assist in differentiating between direct and secondary effects. Clearly, a deeper understanding of the host immune response to these infections will be critical to the development of  S. epidermidis  vaccines and novel therapies.

         Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumor primarily associated with asbestos exposure. Early detection of MPM is restricted by the long latency period until clinical presentation, the ineffectiveness of imaging techniques in early stage detection and the lack of non-invasive biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study we used transcriptome data mining in order to determine which  CLAUDIN  (CLDN) genes are differentially expressed in MPM as compared to controls. Using the same approach we identified the interactome of the differentially expressed  CLDN  genes and assessed their expression profile. Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of tumor histology, asbestos exposure,  CDKN2A  deletion status, and gender on the gene expression level of the claudin interactome. We found that 5 out of 15 studied  CLDNs  ( 4, 5, 8, 10, 15 ) and 4 out of 27 available interactors ( S100B, SHBG, CDH5, CXCL8 ) were differentially expressed in MPM specimens vs. healthy tissues. The genes encoding the CLDN-15 and S100B proteins present differences in their expression profile between the three histological subtypes of MPM. Moreover,  CLDN-15  is significantly under-expressed in the cohort of patients with previous history of asbestos exposure.  CLDN-15  was also found significantly underexpressed in patients lacking the  CDKN2A  gene. These results warrant the detailed  in vitro  investigation of the role of CDLN-15 in the pathobiology of MPM.

       Introduction 
       Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumor primarily associated with exposure to asbestos. Due to the prolonged latent period between asbestos exposure and clinical presentation of the disease, the incidence of MPM has continued to rise across Europe even after the imposed restrictions on asbestos use (Jennings et al.,  2014 ). Worldwide the incidence of MPM is increasing and it is expected to peak in the years 2015–2025 (Robinson and Lake,  2005 ). MPM diagnosis and treatment is challenging, therefore current research efforts are focused in biomarker discovery that would aid its early diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic outcome prediction (Brims et al.,  2013 ). Transcriptome studies combined with data mining techniques have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and have led to the identification of new candidate biomarkers with potential clinical value (Melaiu et al.,  2012 ). 
       Claudins represent a 24-member family of tetraspan transmembrane proteins that contribute to the formation and the proper function of tight junctions (TJs) (Valle and Morin,  2010 ). They regulate the paracellular transport of ions and molecules in a size and charge sensitive manner (Gonzalez-Mariscal et al.,  2010 ). A notable feature of claudins is that some members increase the paracellular permeability while others decrease it. More specifically, claudin-2, -7, -10, -15, and -16 increase the paracellular cation permeability in the Tight Junctions (TJ) whereas claudin-3-, -4, -5, -8, -11, -14, and -18 have a sealing function (Amasheh et al.,  2002 ,  2005 ; Milatz et al.,  2010 ; Soini,  2011 ). In addition to their contribution to the establishment of cellular polarity, the TJ proteins also participate in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation (Facchetti et al.,  2007b ; Lal-Nag and Morin,  2009 ; Soini,  2011 ). 
       The pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) form a monolayer that expresses claudins in their TJs, although their exact role in the pleural physiology and pathophysiology is scarcely investigated (Apostolidou et al.,  2012 ). Currently it is known that mesothelial TJ claudins contribute to the pleural membrane permeability, while during inflammation the expression levels of claudins change leading to increased pleural permeability (Markov et al.,  2011 ; Markov and Amasheh,  2014 ). These data highlight the role of claudins and TJ related proteins in the context of pleural physiology and pathophysiology. 
       Several studies have highlighted the role of claudins in cancer since in several malignancies (lung, kidney, breast, stomach, instestine, pancreas, and others) their expression is deregulated (Osanai et al.,  2017 ). Furthermore, accumulating data suggest roles for claudins in tumor development and progression as well as in signal transduction while in several cancers expression of claudins is associated with prognosis (Osanai et al.,  2017 ). Claudins have also been studied in the context of MPM by means of immunohistochemistry (Kleinberg et al.,  2007 ; Chaouche-Mazouni et al.,  2015 ). In this aspect several changes in the expression of claudins have been documented (Ouban and Ahmed,  2010 ; Soini,  2011 ). Most studies so far have focused on the diagnostic value of claudins, notably claudins 1–7, in distinguishing MPM from other carcinomas. Claudin-4 has been shown to be highly effective in the differential diagnosis between MPM and metastatic carcinomas (Facchetti et al.,  2007a , b ; Ohta et al.,  2013 ; Ordóñez,  2013 ; Jo et al.,  2014 ). However, at the transcriptional level there is scarcity of information regarding the differential gene expression of claudins between healthy and MPM samples. 
       In this study we applied data mining and transcriptomic analysis in order to determine the CLAUDIN ( CLDN ) genes that are differentially expressed in MPM specimens as compared to healthy controls. Using the same approach we also probed for CLDN interactors and assessed their expression patterns so as to identify novel genes interacting with  CLDNs  that may contribute to the pathophysiology of MPM. Finally, we evaluated the effect of MPM histology, asbestos exposure,  CDKN2A  deletion status, and gender on the gene expression level of the claudin interactome. 
     
     
       Materials and methods 
       
         Identification of the differential gene expression profile of CLDNs in microarray data from MPM and control counterparts 
         We used gene expression data from an MPM study included in the Oncomine Research Premium Edition Cancer Microarray database ( http://www.oncomine.org ) in order to investigate the gene expression profile of  CLDNs  (Gordon et al.,  2005 ; GEO Profiles: GDS 1220). We analyzed data for the 15  CLDN  genes that were assessed in this study ( CLDN-1, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -14, -15, -16, -17, -18 ) in order to detect their potential differential expression in MPM specimens as compared to healthy ones. The genes that were not assessed in GDS 1220, were  CLDNs  -2, -12, -19, -20, -22, -23, -24,-25. In order to ensure that the data were generated with the same methodology, we selected gene expression data from a single study (a study that from this point on will be referred as Gordon Mesothelioma study throughout the text). In this study the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A array was used assessing 12.624 genes. The raw data were downloaded from Oncomine in Excel format, and were scrutinized selecting only the ones referring to surgically excised samples excluding the ones referring to mesothelial (1 sample) and MPM cell lines (4 samples). Finally, in this study there were  n  = 40 MPM cases and  n  = 9 controls ( n  = 5 pleura and  n  = 4 lung samples). The gene expression data were log transformed, median centered per array, and the standard deviation was normalized to one per array as described previously (Rhodes et al.,  2004 ). All values from the transformed data were downloaded from Oncomine during March 2013. 
       
       
         Identification of the interactome of the differentially expressed claudins 
         The gene interaction network of the significantly differentially expressed  CLDNs  in MPM patients was constructed using Bio-grid ( http://thebiogrid.org ), ConsensusPathDB ( http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/ ) and String 9.05 ( http://string-db.org/ ) databases. The Bio-grid database is a repository of genetic and protein-protein interactions that are curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major model organism species (Chatr-Aryamontri et al.,  2013 ). The ConsensusPathDB database integrates interaction networks including binary and complex protein-protein, genetic, metabolic, signaling, gene regulatory, and drug-target interactions as well as biochemical pathways (Kamburov et al.,  2009 ,  2013 ). String 9.05 is a database of known and predicted protein interactions including both direct (physical), and indirect (functional) associations (Szklarczyk et al.,  2011 ). 
         After querying for each differentially expressed  CLDN  in the above databases, we superimposed the results in order to remove duplicate or triplicate genes and created a list of unique genes ( List 1 ) that comprised the interactome of the significantly over- and under- expressed  CLDNs  in MPM patients from the Gordon Mesothelioma study. The members of  List 1  are shown in Table  1 , where their name along with their description is provided based on GeneCards query that was performed. GeneCards ( http://www.genecards.org ) is an integrated database of human genes that provides concise genomic related information, on all known and predicted human genes (Safran et al.,  2003 ). The members of  List 1  were subject to the differential gene expression analysis in the microarray data of the Gordon Mesothelioma study so as to identify their profile.

         Identification of the differential gene expression profile of CLDNs interactome in microarray data from MPM with respect to tumor histology, asbestos exposure, CDKN2A deletion status, and gender 
         We used gene expression data from the only MPM study included in the Oncomine Research Premium Edition Cancer Microarray database ( http://www.oncomine.org ) that compared gene expression levels in the three main phenotypes of MPM (epithelioid, biphasic, and sarcomatoid) in order to investigate the gene expression profile of the claudin interactome in relation to disease phenotype (Lopez-Rios et al.,  2006 ; a study that from this point on will be referred as Lopez-Rios Mesothelioma study throughout the text). Furthermore, the same genes were analyzed based asbestos exposure (exposed/unexposed),  CDKN2A  deletion status (deletion/no deletion), and gender (male/female). Reported asbestos exposure history was extracted by the sample annotation information file provided in the supplementary materials of the Lopez-Rios Mesothelioma study provided in  http://cbio.mskcc.org/public/Ladanyi_lab_mesothelioma_datasets/ . This study included adequate microarray data from each histological subtype of MPM ( n  = 69 epithelioid,  n  = 10 sarcomatoid,  n  = 20 biphasic). We analyzed data only for those genes that were found to be over- or under-expressed in the samples of MPM patients in the Gordon Mesothelioma study. All values from the transformed data were downloaded from Oncomine during March 2013 following the same procedures as in the case of the Gordon Mesothelioma study. The levels of gene expression were subsequently arranged into strata with respect to asbestos exposure history (exposed/unexposed),  CDKN2A  deletion status (deletion/no deletion) and gender (male/female). Regarding asbestos exposure history, 58 patients reported asbestos exposure history, 29 patients reported non-exposure to asbestos, while for 12 patients this information was unknown and they were excluded from the sub-analysis concerning the effects of asbestos exposure. Regarding  CDKN2A  deletion status, homozygous deletion was present in 59 patients, in 29 patients it was not present while in 19 patients the information was not available thus they were excluded from the subanalysis. 
       
       
         Statistical analysis 
         GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test was used to assess the data distribution. Comparisons of gene expression between MPM and healthy specimens were performed with the un-paired  t -test for parametric data and the Mann–Whitney  U -test for non-parametric data. The Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) was employed for multiple correction testing, which reports FDR (or  q -value), in order to corroborate the validity of the results. The calculation of the  q  statistic was based on the formula given by Rhodes et al. ( 2004 ). The mean values of gene expression in the three histological subtypes of MPM were compared with the One-Way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test for parametric data and the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test for non-parametric data. Analysis with respect to asbestos exposure history (exposed/unexposed),  CDKN2A  deletion status (deletion/no deletion) and gender (male/female) was performed with the un-paired  t -test and the Mann–Whitney  U- test for parametric and non-parametric data respectively. Statistical significance was set at the  p  &lt; 0.05 and  q  &lt; 0.05 level. 
       
     
     
       Results 
       
         Identification of the differential gene expression profile of CLDNs in microarray data from MPM and control counterparts 
         The gene expression of  CLDN-15  was found to be significantly over-expressed in MPM specimens ( q  &lt; 0.002) as compared to healthy tissues. On the other hand,  CLDNs -4, -5, -8 , and  -10  were significantly under-expressed compared to controls ( q  = 0.036,  q  = 0.001,  q  = 0.003, and  q  = 0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the gene expression of  CLDN -1, -3, -6, -7, -11, -14, -16 , and  -17 . The results are summarized in Table  2 .

         Identification of the interactome of the differentially expressed CLDNs 
         In the analysis performed in the 3 databases as explained in the Section Materials and Methods, 41 genes were found to constitute the interaction network of the significantly differentially expressed  CLDNs . The symbols and descriptions of those genes, as reported in the GeneCards database are presented in Table  1 . Gene expression data for further analysis in the Gordon Mesothelioma study were available for 27 interactors (gene symbols:  VKORC1, S100B, EPHA2, GEM, SHBG, UBC, OCLN, TJP1-3, INADL, CDH5, MPDZ, CLDN-1, -3, -6, -9, -11, -14, -16, -17, -18, TACSTD2, CXCL8, ETV5, GRM5, FGF1 ) while no gene expression data were available for 14 interactors (gene symbols:  WNK4, CLDN -2, -12, -19, -20, -22, -23, -24, -25, ESAM, CCDC155, SYNE4, ATE1, MARVELD3  ) . 
       
       
         Identification of the differential gene expression profile of the interactome members of the significantly differentially expressed CLDNs 
         The gene expression of  S100B, SHBG, CDH5 , and  CXCL8  were significantly under-expressed compared to controls ( q  = 0.001,  q  = 0.004,  q  = 0.015, and  q  = 0.007, respectively). The results are summarized in Table  3 .

         Evaluation of the effect of disease phenotype, CDKN2A deletion status, asbestos exposure, and gender 
         The gene expression of  CLDN-15  was found to be significantly increased in the epithelioid histological subtype of MPM as compared to both the biphasic and sarcomatoid phenotypes ( p  &lt; 0.01 and  p  &lt; 0.001, respectively; Figure  1 ). The  S100B  gene was found significantly over-expressed in the sarcomatoid type of MPM compared to the epithelioid one ( p  &lt; 0.05; Figure  2 ). There was no significant difference in the gene expression of  CLDN-4, -5, -8, -10, SHBG, CDH5 , and  CXCL8  among the three histological subtypes of MPM. Subsequent analysis with respect to history of asbestos exposure showed that the  CLDN-15  gene was significantly under-expressed in the cohort of patients that were previously exposed to asbestos as compared to the unexposed ones ( p  = 0.004; Figure  3 ). In addition,  CLDN-15  was found significantly under-expressed in the subgroup of patients with homozygous deletion of the  CDKN2A  gene as opposed to the patients with no deletion ( p  = 0.035; Figure  4 ). Gene expression of  CLDN-4, -5, -8, -10, S100B, SHBG, CDH5 , and  CXCL8  was not influenced by asbestos exposure and CDKN2A deletion status. Finally, the gene expression of  CLDN-4, -5, -8, -10, -15, S100B, SHBG, CDH5 , and  CXCL8  was not influenced by gender.

       Discussion 
       MPM is a highly aggressive tumor arising from the mesothelial cells that line the pleural cavity (Rascoe et al.,  2012 ). Due to the established cause and effect relationship between asbestos exposure and MPM development, researchers seek to identify suitable biomarkers for screening asbestos exposed populations and for early diagnosis while avoiding false positive results and unnecessary invasive procedures (Ostroff et al.,  2012 ). Although, several studies have pointed to the effectiveness of soluble mesothelin as a biomarker with high specificity, its limited sensitivity confines its use as a screening tool for the asymptomatic, asbestos-exposed cohorts (Creaney et al.,  2015 ). Thus, at the present time, there are no biomarkers in widespread clinical use for MPM (Creaney et al.,  2015 ). 
       Transcript profiling along with new omics-technologies and bioinformatics, have been extensively used in the field of personalized medicine enabling researchers to identify biomarkers for cancer screening, diagnosis, and prognosis (Diamantis et al.,  2010 ). In this study we used established data mining techniques through which we have already reported  AQP1, CLIC3, CLIC4 , and  BBS1  to be ideal candidates for further study in MPM pathophysiology (Jagirdar et al.,  2013 ; Tasiopoulou et al.,  2015 ; Vavougios et al.,  2015 ). 
       Claudins are structural molecules of TJs present in epithelial, endothelial, and mesothelial cells (Soini et al.,  2006 ; Soini,  2011 ). The patterns of claudin expression within TJs are distinctly diverse among different tissues accounting for the observed differences in permeability and electrical resistance of various epithelia (Chao et al.,  2009 ; Markov et al.,  2011 ). It should be noted that not only the expression of claudin family members but also their localization within cells may vary (Amasheh et al.,  2002 ; Dittmann et al.,  2014 ). The latter might be affected by several exogenous factors such as food components, plant compounds and microbial toxins (Dittmann et al.,  2014 ; Markov et al.,  2014 ). 
       Differential gene expression of claudins has been reported in several tumors depending on the exact claudin and cancer studied (Facchetti et al.,  2007b ; Chao et al.,  2009 ; Lal-Nag and Morin,  2009 ; Gonzalez-Mariscal et al.,  2010 ; Valle and Morin,  2010 ; Davidson,  2011 ; Soini,  2011 ). Here we report that  -15  is significantly over-expressed in MPM patients as compared to controls, while  CLDNs -4, -5 , and  -8  are significantly under-expressed. An  in vitro  study using M14K (epithelioid MPM) and M38K (biphasic MPM) cell lines (Chaouche-Mazouni et al.,  2013 ) has shown by means of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting a high level of claudin 15 in both cell lines as opposed to claudins 3 and 4. An earlier study demonstrated by means of immunohistochemistry that in MPM there was a lower expression of claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, and -7 than in metastatic adenocarcinomas of the pleura, suggesting that they could serve as differential diagnostic markers (Soini et al.,  2006 ). In the same report, non-neoplastic PMCs showed expression of claudin 2 but no expression was found for claudin-3, -4, -5, and -7. Two more studies assessing the expression of claudin-4 in a large series of normal and MPM tissues by immunohistochemistry, reported that claudin-4 is a definitive negative marker for MPM which is in agreement with our data showing the significant under-expression of  CLDN-4  in MPM as opposed to controls (Facchetti et al.,  2007a , b ). This finding has been consistently shown in other studies as well (Ohta et al.,  2013 ; Ordóñez,  2013 ; Jo et al.,  2014 ). Finally one more study has demonstrated that the gene expression of  CLDN-3, -4 , and  -6  was significantly lower in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma as compared to ovarian carcinomas (Davidson et al.,  2006 ). 
       In our study we also demonstrate that the  CLDN-15  gene is significantly over-expressed in the epithelioid histological subtype of MPM as compared to the sarcomatoid and biphasic phenotypes. Similar results were shown in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma at the protein level (Davidson et al.,  2006 ). 
       On the contrary, we observed that the gene expression of  S100B  is significantly increased in sarcomatoid MPM as compared to epithelioid MPM. S100B has been reported as a useful biomarker in assessing tumor load, stage, and prognosis for patients with malignant melanoma (Zarogoulidis et al.,  2015 ). 
       It has been suggested that the differences in the molecular biology of epithelioid and non-epithelioid MPM may contribute to differences in their clinical behavior (Balduyck et al.,  2010 ). The epithelioid cell type is among the factors that favor the overall survival of MPM patients (Balduyck et al.,  2010 ; Musk et al.,  2011 ; Linton et al.,  2014 ). As a consequence it has been proposed that the diagnosis of the sarcomatoid variant on a biopsy should preclude radical surgery, and therapy should aim at symptoms management and preservation of quality of life (Balduyck et al.,  2010 ). Therefore, the clear distinction of histological subtypes could direct clinicians to the appropriate treatment options. In the literature it is supported that the current golden standard for MPM diagnosis is a combination of two positive and two negative immunohistochemical markers in the epithelioid and biphasic type, but sarcomatous type do not have specific markers, making diagnosis more difficult (Panou et al.,  2015 ). Here we propose that  CLDN-15  and  S100B  could serve as complementary diagnostic tools and should be further investigated. 
       Next we observed that  CLDN-15  was under-expressed in patients lacking the  CDKN2A  gene. Moreover, the  CLDN-15  gene was significantly under-expressed in MPM patients with previous history of asbestos exposure compared to the unexposed ones.  CDKN2A  is the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor gene in human MPM. The inactivation of both p16 INK4a  and Arf products of the  CDKN2A  gene has been suggested to act synergistically in accelerating asbestos-induced tumorigenesis  in vivo  (Sekido,  2013 ). Development of MPM is strongly associated with asbestos exposure, with 80% of the patients having previous exposure to asbestos fibers (Robinson and Lake,  2005 ; Nakano,  2008 ; Sekido,  2013 ). A significant association has been described between increasing number of methylated cell cycle control genes and asbestos burden. This finding was followed by the observation that quantitative measure of asbestos exposure was associated with over 100 discrete CpG loci and that in 94% of cases there was increased methylation associated with increased exposure (Christensen and Marsit,  2011 ). The correlation between methylation status and extended exposure to asbestos was also confirmed by Fujii et al. ( 2012 ). Likewise, the results of this study are indicative of the epigenetic effect of asbestos in the transcriptional level of the  CLDN-15  gene suggesting its potential utility as a screening biomarker for populations at risk. 
       Although, in our analysis with respect to gender the gene expression of  CLDN-4, -5, -8, -15, S100B, SHBG, CDH5 , and  CXCL8  was not different between sexes, we observed that the  SHBG  gene which encodes the Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin was under-expressed in MPM patients as compared to healthy controls.  SHBG  is a major regulator of free plasma androgens and also mediates androgen and estrogen signaling at the cell membrane via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (Mononen and Schleutker,  2009 ). 
       It is generally accepted that although MPM is less common in women compared to men, female MPM patients survive longer (Balduyck et al.,  2010 ; Musk et al.,  2011 ; Linton et al.,  2014 ; Taioli et al.,  2014 ). It has been proposed that differences in asbestos exposure, tumor biology, and the impact of circulating hormones on host response must be investigated to understand this survival advantage and improve prognosis for patients of both genders (Taioli et al.,  2014 ). The observed down-regulation of the  SHBG  gene in the group of MPM patients relative to the control group advocates the role of sex hormones in the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease. This is stressed out by a study showing that estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) acts as a tumor suppressor of high potential relevance to prediction of disease progression and to therapeutic response in MPM patients (Pinton et al.,  2009 ). 
       As in the case of  SHBG , the genes encoding S100B, CDH5 and CXCL8 were found significantly under-expressed in MPM specimens as compared to their healthy counterparts. The protein product of  S100B  interacts with its target proteins within cells to regulate enzyme activities, cell growth, differentiation and Ca 2+  homeostasis (Pang et al.,  2012 ). It is thought that expression levels of individual S100 family proteins vary considerably in different tumors and with respect to cancer progression (Harpio and Einarsson,  2004 ). 
       CXCL8 or interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a proinflammatory CXC-type chemokine involved in the promotion of neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation (Waugh and Wilson,  2008 ). It has been demonstrated that many types of human carcinomas express high levels of IL-8 relative to normal tissues (Palena et al.,  2012 ). In addition, high serum levels of this chemokine correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis while a link exists between IL-8, tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor stemness (Palena et al.,  2012 ; Gales et al.,  2013 ). In this study,  IL-8  gene was found down-regulated in the group of MPM patients compared to the control group. It has been demonstrated that neutrophil infiltration into the pleural space is a characteristic feature of an early and acute inflammatory response in several pleural diseases and that activated PMCs secrete IL-8 in a polarized fashion (Nasreen et al.,  2001 ). Inhibition of IL-8 has been shown to reduce human MPM propagation in a nude mouse model (Galffy et al.,  1999 ). Asbestos directly stimulate PMCs to synthesize IL-8, possibly playing an important role in mediating asbestos induced pleural inflammation (Batra and Antony,  2015 ; Mutsaers et al.,  2015 ). Further studies are warranted to compare IL-8 expression and features of EMT at various stages of tumor development (Palena et al.,  2012 ). 
       Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin; CDH5), an endothelial specific cell-cell adhesion molecule, plays a pivotal role in the formation, maturation, and remodeling of the vascular wall (Gavard,  2009 ). It has been shown that CDH5 directly enhances the expression level of CLDN-5 by tethering repressive transcription factors away from the CLDN -5  promoter. Conversely, the absence of functional CDH5 is associated with loss of CLDN-5 expression (Taddei et al.,  2008 ; Gavard,  2009 ). These results suggest that any changes in CDH5 will impact the endothelial barrier function at multiple levels and also explain why CDH5 inhibition may cause a marked increase in permeability (Gavard and Gutkind,  2008 ; Taddei et al.,  2008 ). Increased permeability is an early step in the angiogenic process enabling endothelial migration out of the primary vessel in order to begin formation of the tumor neovasculature (Le Guelte et al.,  2011 ). On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that induction of CDH5 during EMT promotes breast cancer progression via TGFβ signaling indicating that in certain tumor cells, CDH5 can induce cellular responses that are in contrast to its role in cell-cell contact growth inhibition in endothelial cells (Labelle et al.,  2008 ). Thus, there are two distinct functions of CDH5 both in angiogenesis and progression of cancer (Labelle et al.,  2008 ). 
       Regarding thoracic tumors in particular, it has been reported that VE-cadherin may be an interesting marker for analysis in anti-angiogenic therapeutic trials although results from clinical studies are pending (Reinmuth et al.,  2010 ). 
       An important limitation of our findings is the lack of information regarding the asbestos exposure history of the MPM patients of the Gordon Mesothelioma study. If these data were available we could assess asbestos induced gene expression changes between MPM patients and controls. Our results require further investigation in the clinical setting with the inclusion of a large series of MPM patients vs. healthy asbestos exposed individuals serving as controls. Moreover, detailed information regarding the duration of asbestos exposure and the type of exposure (environmental/occupational) should also be incorporated in future research. 
     
     
       Conclusions 
       The results of this study are suggestive of a distinct gene expression profile of the claudin interactome in MPM and underline the epigenetic effect of asbestos on the transcriptional level of the  CLDN-15  gene. The role of claudin-15 and S100B in pleural physiology and pathophysiology is unknown and requires in depth investigation at the functional level. Additionally, both  CLDN-15  and  S100B  should be further investigated as gene biomarkers in MPM with respect to their potential to discriminate the histological MPM subgroups at the molecular level and thus provide tools for personalized therapy.

         The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microbial metabolism and stress response has emerged as a major theme in microbiology and infectious disease. Reactive fluorescent dyes have the potential to advance the study of ROS in the complex intracellular environment, especially for high-content and high-throughput analyses. However, current dye-based approaches to measuring intracellular ROS have the potential for significant artifacts. Here, we describe a robust platform for flow cytometric quantification of ROS in bacteria using fluorescent dyes, with ROS measurements in 10s-of-1000s of individual cells under a variety of conditions. False positives and variability among sample types (e.g., bacterial species, stress conditions) are reduced with a flexible four-step gating scheme that accounts for side- and forward-scattered light (morphological changes), background fluorescence, DNA content, and dye uptake to identify cells producing ROS. Using CellROX Green dye with  Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis , and  Mycobacterium bovis  BCG as diverse model bacteria, we show that (1) the generation of a quantifiable CellROX Green signal for superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide-induced hydroxyl radicals, validates this dye as a superoxide detector; (2) the level of dye-detectable superoxide does not correlate with cytotoxicity or antibiotic sensitivity; (3) the non-replicating, antibiotic tolerant state of nutrient-deprived mycobacteria is associated with high levels of superoxide; and (4) antibiotic-induced production of superoxide is idiosyncratic with regard to both the species and the physiological state of the bacteria. We also show that the gating method is applicable to other fluorescent indicator dyes, such as the 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride for cellular esterase and reductive respiratory activities, respectively. These results demonstrate that properly controlled flow cytometry coupled with fluorescent probes provides precise and accurate quantitative analysis of ROS generation and metabolic changes in stressed bacteria.

       Introduction 
       Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to play critical roles in microbial metabolism ( Imlay, 2013 ) and response to environmental stressors such as antibiotic exposure ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Zhao and Drlica, 2014 ). Though “ROS” are often viewed as a single agent, the widely differing chemistry of specific types of ROS critically determines their function in microbes. Among the biologically relevant ROS, superoxide (O 2  •– ) is a relatively unreactive species (t 1/2  ∼ 1–15 min) arising from electron transport processes and cytochrome activity, and is detoxified by superoxide dismutases (SOD) to the relatively inert hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) ( Hassan and Fridovich, 1979 ;  Iyanagi, 1990 ;  Dedon and Tannenbaum, 2004 ). Reduction of H 2 O 2  by redox-active metals (e.g., Fe 2+ /Fe 3+  and Cu 1+ /Cu 2+  in Fenton chemistry), yields highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (t 1/2  ∼ 10 -9  s) ( Imlay et al., 1988 ;  Imlay, 2013 ,  2015 ;  Bataineh et al., 2016 ). Though less abundant in bacteria, another source of hydroxyl radicals involves homolytic scission of peroxynitrite (ONOO - ; t 1/2  ∼ 1 s) arising from the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and O 2  •–  ( Dedon and Tannenbaum, 2004 ). 
       The recent emergence of fluorescent probes to detect ROS builds on the decades-long use of fluorescent dyes to study bacterial components, such as nucleic acid abundance or dehydrogenase activity ( Walberg et al., 1999 ;  Nebe-von-Caron et al., 2000 ). In bacteria, fluorescent probes have been most widely used in attempts to define the role of ROS production in response to antibiotic exposures ( Albesa et al., 2004 ;  Goswami et al., 2006 ;  Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Wang et al., 2010 ;  Dwyer et al., 2012 ). A variety of fluorescent ROS probes are now available, with each probe claiming to possess different reactivity, stability, fluorescence and membrane transport properties ( Kalyanaraman et al., 2012 ;  Imlay, 2015 ). However, the efficiency and specificity of different dyes for detecting different ROS  in vivo  have rarely been established with any confidence ( Kalyanaraman et al., 2012 ), much less across a range of different bacteria. Among other dyes, bacterial ROS have often been studied using 3′-( p -hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) ( Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Dwyer et al., 2012 ,  2014 ) and 5- or 6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H 2 DCFDA) ( Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ). The latter is prone to signal artifacts due to erroneous amplification of the fluorescence intensity by a redox-cycling mechanism involving an intermediate radical ( Kalyanaraman et al., 2012 ). This problem has led several groups to use HPF for ROS analysis in bacteria ( Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Dwyer et al., 2012 ;  Grant et al., 2012 ), but HPF almost exclusively detects “highly ROS” such as hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid ( Setsukinai et al., 2003 ). While there is emerging evidence for involvement of ROS in antibiotic-induced stress in a limited range of model bacteria, mainly  Escherichia coli , recent studies have challenged the generality of antibiotic-induced ROS production on the basis of the low dynamic range of HPF ( Renggli et al., 2013 ) and problems with spurious fluorescent signals and other artifacts ( Keren et al., 2013 ;  Liu and Imlay, 2013 ;  Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ). 
       There are other factors that complicate the use of ROS-sensitive dyes. Among these are the uptake and removal of both unreacted and ROS-activated dye molecules from the cells by efflux pumps, increased membrane permeability caused by cellular stress ( Renggli et al., 2013 ), as well as poorly defined bacterial metabolic states at the time of the stress and dye staining. For example, while  E. coli  does not possess cytochrome P450s, mycobacteria have dozens ( McLean et al., 2010 ;  Ouellet et al., 2010 ), with P450s as well-established sources of O 2  •–  ( Munro et al., 2013 ). The difficulty of measuring ROS coupled with these idiosyncratic factors in individual bacteria and across different bacterial species have hindered a broader examination of cell state as a factor in stress-induced ROS generation and its role in the decision between cell death and survival. 
       To overcome these problems, we developed a robust, artifact-minimized platform for high-throughput flow cytometric detection of ROS in bacteria using a stable, DNA-binding fluorescent dye. This standardized approach employs a four-step gating scheme to account for side-scattered and forward-scattered light, DNA content, and dye uptake to accurately identify and quantify ROS-producing cells. The method accounts for autofluorescence arising from changes in cell morphology, membrane composition, and protein expression during normal cell growth and the cellular response to stresses such as antibiotic treatment and starvation ( Kim et al., 2011 ;  Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ). 
       We piloted this method with CellROX Green dye to assess its activity in living bacteria and to assess claims ( Choi et al., 2015 ) that CellROX Green is selective for O 2  •–  in bacterial cells. There are many methods for detecting O 2  •– , including electrochemistry, UV-VIS spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, and vibrational spectroscopy ( Hayyan et al., 2016 ), though intracellular O 2  •–  has traditionally been quantified by extracellular reduction of ferricytochrome c or by electron spin-resonance (ESR) with spin trapping by 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline  N -oxide ( Frejaville et al., 1995 ;  Huycke et al., 1996 ;  Korshunov and Imlay, 2006 ). Neither of these bulk measurements provide single-cell resolution of endogenous O 2  •–  in bacterial populations. Though new probes specific to O 2  •–  and suitable for direct  in vivo  studies have been developed in recent years, they have not been evaluated in bacteria ( Mukhopadhyay et al., 2007 ;  Hu et al., 2015 ;  Shin et al., 2015 ). Here, we applied our flow cytometric method with CellROX Green to quantify O 2  •–  production in three diverse but well-studied model bacteria,  E. coli  and the mycobacterial species  Mycobacterium smegmatis  and  Mycobacterium bovis  bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), all subjected to the well-studied stresses of antibiotic exposure and nutrient depletion. We found that changes in O 2  •–  production across isogenic bacterial populations are heterogeneous and highly dependent upon the nature of the stress and the physiological state of the cells. We also demonstrate the utility of the flow-cytometry method for two other metabolism-sensitive fluorescent dyes: 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA) for esterase activity ( Schreer et al., 2005 ) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) for cellular respiratory activity ( Rodriguez et al., 1992 ). 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Bacteria Strains and Culture 
          Mycobacterium smegmatis  mc 2 155 (ATCC 700084) was plated on 7H10 agar supplemented with 10% Middlebrook Oleic Albumin Dextrose Catalase (OADC) growth supplement and 0.2% glycerol. After picking three separate colonies, the mycobacterial strain was grown in 10 mL of 7H9 media supplemented with 10% albumin  D -glucose-salt supplement (ADS), 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 at 37°C in a shaker.  M. smegmatis  was passaged twice before treatment of mid-log growing cells.  M. bovis  bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) Pasteur strain 1172P2 was cultured from isogenic freezer stocks in 50 mL conical tubes then passaged into roller bottles with supplemented 7H9 media ( Chionh et al., 2016 ). For nutrient-deprived (i.e., starved) cultures,  M. smegmatis  and BCG were grown to OD 600  0.8–1.0, washed twice in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4), and re-suspended to an OD 600  ∼1.0 (BCG) or 0.1 ( M. smegmatis ) in PBS plus 0.05% Tyloxapol (non-metabolizable detergent to prevent clumping) in roller bottles. CFUs for BCG were determined from 10-fold serial dilution plating on 7H10 at 37°C for 14–21 days. Single colonies of  E. coli  DH5α or K-12 BW25113 were grown overnight in LB broth, diluted 1:100 in fresh LB as a subculture and grown to OD 600  0.4–0.6 to use in studies. CFUs for  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  was determined from 10-fold serial dilution plating on LB incubated overnight ( E. coli ) or 2 days ( M. smegmatis ) at 37°C. Knock-out mutants for  sodA  and  sodB  in the  E. coli  K-12 BW25113 background were obtained from the  E. coli  Keio Knockout Collection (GE Dharmacon). 
       
       
         Antibiotic and Toxicant Exposures 
         Antibiotics were subjected to twofold serial dilutions in 7H9 media or PBS in 96-well plates containing 100 μL per well. For H 2 O 2  and menadione treatments, reagents were added to each well of a 96-well plate at concentrations twofold higher than the final exposure condition. Bacterial cultures were diluted to an OD 0.1 ( M. smegmatis  and  E. coli ) or 0.2 (BCG) and 100 μL was added to each well containing antibiotic, H 2 O 2 , menadione, media or PBS, for a total treatment volume of 200 μL. The plates were incubated for indicated times at 37°C. For menadione and H 2 O 2  treatments, cultures were washed once and resuspended in PBS, while antibiotic-treated cells were diluted in fresh media without washing. For the PBS versus 10% 7H9/LB, 20 uL of culture was transferred directly (no wash) into either 180 uL of 100% PBS or PBS + 10% LB/7H9 in the presence of 0.5 uM CellROX (a 10x dilution). After 30 min cells were fixed by the addition of paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4%) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Antibiotic-tolerant  M. smegmatis  were generated by diluting mid-log growing cells to OD 0.1 and aliquoting 100 μL to individual wells containing an antibiotic at a range of concentrations in a 96-well plate. Cultures were covered and incubated at 37°C with humidity for 1 or 5 days prior to analysis. 
       
       
         Flow Cytometry and Dye Staining 
         For flow cytometry staining, 20 μL volumes of treated cells were added to 180 μL of 0.5 μM CellROX Green (ThermoFisher), 5 mM CTC (ThermoFisher), or 10 ng/mL CFDA (ThermoFisher) in PBS in 96-well V-bottom plates and incubated for 30 min (1 h for CTC) at 37°C. For menadione and H 2 O 2  treatments, CellROX Green was included in the PBS during treatment (60 min). After incubation, 50 μL of DAPI (5 μg/mL) in 4% PFA-PBS was added to the cells for &gt;10 min at 25°C prior to analysis. Samples were analyzed within 2 h on a custom LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with CellROX Green, CFDA, and CTC excited by an argon laser and detected with a 530/30 nm band-pass emission filter or 670 LP emission filter for CTC. DAPI was excited with a UV laser and detected with a 450/50 nm band-pass emission filter. Samples were analyzed using a HTS fluidics system directly from the 96-well V-bottom staining plate. The flow rate was set to 3.0 μL/s with a 150 μL injection volume, 100 μL mixing volume, 250 μL/s mixing speed, five mixes, and a wash volume of 800 μL. For each sample 50,000–200,000 events were collected when possible. For antibiotic treatments, only samples with &gt;10,000 DAPI +  cells were analyzed. Data was collected by Diva (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo v10.0.6 (Tree Star, Inc.). Gating was set using unstained samples for the bacterial population by forward-scatter (FSC; correlates with cell size) and side-scatter (SSC; correlates with cell internal granularity) of light and to determine background fluorescence. Single DAPI-stained cells were used to gate the DNA-positive population, while single CellROX Green-, CFDA-, or CTC-stained cells were used to determine the dye-positive population. The single-color stains were also used for compensation, as needed, between the dye signals. A Biotek Synergy 4 microplate reader was used for fluorescence measurements with excitation of CellROX Green using a 485/20 nm filter and emission captured at 528/20 nm. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism GraphPad Software 6.

         Design Criteria for an Artifact-Minimized Method for High-Throughput Quantification of Bacterial ROS Using Fluorescent Dyes 
         The availability of fluorescent dyes for the detection and quantification of reactive chemical species in cells has fostered the development of single-cell, multi-parameter, high-throughput analyses in microbiology and antibiotic pharmacology, including both multi-well plate-based population assays and flow cytometry assays. However, factors such as dye uptake efficiency, dye efflux, changes in cell morphology, and background fluorescence complicate the application of these fluorescent dye-based assays to bacteria and confound the interpretation of observed changes in fluorescence. To achieve assay precision and accuracy and ensure credible and biologically meaningful results, we developed a four-step gating scheme ( Figures  1A,B  ) to select for: (1) particle size based on FSC and SSC as light passes through the cells, (2) DNA content based on DAPI staining (or other DNA-binding dyes), (3) the presence of dye based on fluorescence above unstained and DAPI-stained particles, and (4) dye reactivity above baseline or basal fluorescence. Application of this two-dye, multi-gating flow cytometry method distinguishes bacteria from debris by selecting for size and DNA content, which also distinguishes single cells from dividing cells and individual bacterial species in mixed cultures. Additionally, greater sensitivity and specificity for ROS and metabolic activity is achieved by removing contributions from autofluorescence and by selecting only cells that have taken up the dye, with sub-gating of those cells for highly fluorescent activated dye. Here, we illustrate this scheme with CellROX hi  gating for endogenous ROS quantification ( Figure  1B  ) and then demonstrate the versatility of the assay with examples using CTC and CFDA dyes for cellular metabolism ( Figures  1C,D  ).

(A)  Workflow diagram summarizing the four-step flow cytometry gating strategy.  Step 1  selects for bacteria-sized and -shaped particles.  Step 2  excludes particles that do not contain DNA.  Step 3  accounts for background fluorescence by eliminating cells that did not take up the dye and cells with non-specific autofluorescence.  Step 4  quantifies metabolism-associated dye activation. The gating process and rationale is further elaborated in Section “Results and Discussion.”  (B)  Representative contour plots of the four-step gating scheme  of Mycobacterium smegmatis  stained with DAPI and the ROS-reactive dye CellROX Green.

         A 4-Steps Gating Scheme for the Accurate Quantification of ROS Levels in Bacteria 
          Step 1  in the analysis scheme ( Figures  1A,B  ) defines the bacterial population of interest based on FSC and SSC properties. In addition,  Step 1  gating can be adjusted for populations in which a significant portion exhibits changes in cell morphology. By considering increases in fluorescence observed in cells with elevated SSC or FSC post-treatment, which can be performed by two-dimensional gating such as SSC versus fluorescence, these cells can be selected for analysis if they pass the subsequent gates for non-specific background fluorescence (to be considered Dye + ) and then for desired activation of the fluorescent dye. Each bacterial cell has morphological and biological properties that may be uniquely altered in response to stress or as part of its life cycle. Gating (i.e., restricting) SSC and FSC in  Step 1  allows consistent selection for cell size, shape, complexity, and composition. For example, during logarithmic growth, SSC and FSC profiles of rod-shaped filamentous  E. coli  differ from those of  M. smegmatis  bacilli ( Figure  1E  ). Overall, both bacilli and filamentous bacteria have higher FSC signals during cell division. At the same time, population heterogeneity in cell size or length and cellular macromolecular composition can be detected by FSC and SSC, respectively. For  M. smegmatis , heterogeneity is likely due to bacterial replication on the basis of time rather than cell size ( Aldridge et al., 2012 ). Depending upon cytometer settings, non-coccoid bacteria passing through the light source at different angles will be detected as lower or higher FSC/SSC signals than those observed for uniform spheres. Additionally, stresses such as antibiotic exposures can alter cell light scatter by inhibiting replication or altering cell morphology, such as by causing filamentation or by inhibiting septation ( Figure  1E  ) ( Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ;  Saint-Ruf et al., 2016 ). These differences in morphology and composition detected by FSC and SSC should be considered when interpreting bacterial populations during an analysis since these changes can significantly alter the observed fluorescence. 
          Step 2  ensures that only cells with intact DNA are included in the analysis. Small non-viable particles such as cell debris and dust particles also generate FSC and SSC signals. Therefore, DNA content staining is used to differentiate bacteria from particles. This staining step further enables the assessment of several biologically relevant parameters including detection of doubling cells, cell aggregates, and dead cells with fragmented DNA ( Nebe-von-Caron et al., 2000 ). The gating also excludes artifacts from the analysis, which may arise from an abundance of dead cell debris in studies of bacterial persistence and dormancy, as pursued here with  M. smegmatis . For example, subsequent experiments (illustrated in  Figures  4  ,   5  ) show that &gt;90% of the mycobacteria were killed by antibiotics before a drug-resistant population was established, with the debris potentially confounding flow cytometry analysis. 
          Step 3  accounts for dye-based background fluorescence and helps to distinguish cells that take up dye molecules from those that do not, thus increasing the accuracy and rigor of the ROS analysis. Here, the relatively weak but detectable fluorescence of unactivated dye is exploited to select all presumptive dye-containing cells by virtue of their fluorescence above that of unstained cells. This fluorescence of unactivated CellROX Green is apparent as a 10-fold increase in fluorescence in PBS solutions above the PBS background (28 versus 254 f.u. under conditions used in the flow studies) and by a &gt;1.5-fold increase in fluorescence when CellROX Green is added to heat-killed or PFA-fixed cells (depending upon fluorimeter settings and cell concentration). It is important to note that flow cytometry cannot be used to accurately attribute the source of increased fluorescence (above unstained controls) to specific changes in cellular morphology, composition and metabolism, steady-state ROS generation, or increased dye uptake. However, using this gate for dye uptake increases the accuracy for ROS-specific events in the assay. In the absence of this step, all cells from  Steps 1  and  2  will be analyzed regardless of dye uptake status. Only after gating for size, DNA, and dye presence is it possible to accurately identify cells in which ROS has potentially activated the dye molecules to fluoresce above background levels and to quantify the fluorescence intensities of these cells. 
         It is important to point out that  Step 3  also accounts for changes in background fluorescence from a variety of sources. For example, in our hands, the exponential growth in the presence of LB or 7H9 cell culture medium during staining of  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis , respectively, increased background signals by up to 20-fold. Increases in fluorescence were also observed in PFA-fixed and heat-killed bacteria ( Figure  1F  ). As dead cells do not have ROS-generating metabolic processes, such fluorescence increases indicate that ungated fluorescent signals cannot be entirely attributed to the presence of ROS. In these cases, variation in the background fluorescence makes it difficult to determine whether the summed fluorescence increment, above that observed in unstained cells, is due to activated dye that reacted with ROS produced in metabolically active cells, by unreacted dye taken up by cells, or by fluorescent intracellular compounds, such as flavins ( Benson et al., 1979 ). The Dye +/-  gating in  Step 3  minimizes this issue by pre-selecting cells that possess fluorescence greater than unstained cells, which includes cells that have internalized dye molecules regardless of their activation state. 
         In  Step 4 , the degree of dye activation, presumably by ROS, is quantified, here as “CellROX hi .”  Step 3  selects for cells with fluorescence above untreated or control levels, with those with higher levels of fluorescence (CellROX hi ) are deemed to contain elevated levels of the dye-reactive chemicals, presumably ROS; the identity of the reactive chemicals as specific forms of ROS must be defined by appropriate control experiments. Heat-killed or fixed cells that take up dye, but do not produce ROS or other reactive chemicals, are used as gating controls to set the threshold for CellROX hi . Alternatively, ROS production above basal levels or production observed in a control population (e.g., log growing, wild-type, or untreated cells) may also be used to set the CellROX hi  threshold. With the prior gating steps, the normalizing denominator for the CellROX hi  population is the sum total of cells with detectable fluorescence rather than all bacteria analyzed in the sample. 
         The general applicability and utility of the gating scheme is further illustrated in BCG for reductive respiratory activities using CTC and for cellular esterase activity using CFDA-AM ( Figures  1B,C  ). Similar considerations were made for FSC and SSC ( Step 1 ), DNA counterstaining to differentiate cells from debris ( Step 2 ), dye update and retention ( Step 3 ) and dye activation above background fluorescence ( Step 4 ). It is important to note here that CTC becomes insoluble upon reaction, which results in strong fluorescence from activated dye molecules retained within the cells, while the fluorescent carboxyfluoroscein product of CFDA-AM is negatively charged and thus retained within cells longer than fluorescein. This positive attribute is similar to the DNA-binding activity of ROS-activated CellRox Green. 
       
       
         CellROX Green is a Sensitive Detector of Superoxide but not H 2 O 2 -Induced ROS 
         In addition to quantifying ROS, identifying the ROS species generated during stress is a crucial step in establishing the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the stress response. The challenge here is that the reactivity of individual fluorescent probes for specific ROS has not been clearly defined under biological conditions and many probes react with a variety of oxidants and free radical species. We chose to use CellROX Green as an ROS probe due to its unique feature of having high fluorescence quantum yields only upon ROS-activation and binding to dsDNA ( Invitrogen, 2012 ). This feature obviates artifacts due to altered membrane integrity resulting from stress or cell state, and enhances accumulation of ROS-activated dye to maximize fluorescence signal intensity above background and autofluorescence in cells – critical to setting the Dye +  gate in  Step 3 . However, for this probe especially, there is a lack of clarity in the scientific community about its intracellular ROS specificity ( ResearchGate, 2013 ;  Choi et al., 2015 ), and, to our knowledge, there is no consensus on its reactivity in bacterial cells. CellROX Green is a propriety photostable dye, which, according to the manufacturer, exhibits ROS reactivity that complements HPF. Unlike HPF, CellROX Green reacts with hydroxyl radicals, O 2  •–  and  t -butylhydroperoxide  in vitro , but not with H 2 O 2 , NO, ONOO - , or HOCl ( Invitrogen, 2010 ). However, CellROX Green has recently been claimed to react almost exclusively with O 2  •– 
 in vivo  ( Choi et al., 2015 ). Hence, we sought to confirm the identity of the intracellular ROS detected by CellROX Green in bacteria using two well-studied ROS generators: (1) menadione, a quinone that undergoes catalytic one-electron redox cycling to reduce molecular oxygen (O 2 ) to O 2  •–  (t 1/2  ∼ 1–15 min) ( Hassan and Fridovich, 1979 ;  Iyanagi, 1990 ), and (2) H 2 O 2  that reacts with redox-active metals to produce extremely short-lived ferryl or hydroxyl radicals (t 1/2  ∼ 10 -9  s) under specific conditions ( Imlay et al., 1988 ;  Imlay, 2013 ,  2015 ;  Bataineh et al., 2016 ). 
         CellROX Green reproducibly detected of intracellular ROS when incubated for 1 h with live bacteria in the presence of menadione in PBS ( Figure  2  ). While menadione can induce CellROX Green-reactive species by indirect mechanisms, such as alterations of cell metabolism that lead to ROS production ( Marinho et al., 2014 ), we observed no shift in FSC, SSC, or fluorescence signals in either the DAPI or CellROX Green channels (Supplementary Figures  S1A,B ), which ruled out menadione-induced changes in cell biochemistry or morphology that could cause increased non-specific fluorescence or light scattering. Using the four-step gating protocol to minimize signals due to menadione-induced cell permeability changes, non-cytotoxic menadione exposures (Supplementary Figure  S2A ) generated CellROX Green-detectable ROS in both  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures  2A–E  ). Although ROS levels were not elevated in all menadione-exposed cells in an isogenic population when compared with untreated cells, both the cellular fluorescence intensity and number of cells with detectable ROS increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures  2A,C,E  ).

         Unlike menadione treatment, no increases in the proportion of Dye +  or CellROX hi  cells were detected with H 2 O 2  treatment in PBS, even at bactericidal concentrations ( Figure  2   and Supplementary Figure  S2B ). H 2 O 2  exposures did not change SSC, FSC, or fluorescent profiles of either bacterial species, which suggests minimal contributions by non-specific fluorescence or light scattering (Supplementary Figures  S1C,D ). CellROX Green is highly sensitive to hydroxyl radicals arising from Fe 2+ /H 2 O 2 -mediated Fenton chemistry, as demonstrated with hydroxyl radicals generated in reactions of ferrous perchlorate (II) with H 2 O 2  ( Invitrogen, 2010 ,  2012 ,  2016 ). So our results suggest that H 2 O 2 -derived hydroxyl radicals and other H 2 O 2 -derived ROS do not reach levels detectable by CellROX Green in H 2 O 2 -treated  E. coli  or  M. smegmatis . This observation stands in contrast to previous observations in human cells treated with H 2 O 2  ( Segard et al., 2013 ). However, the fluorescence attributed to CellROX dye in the studies of  Segard et al. (2013)  is possibly due to autofluorescence or morphologic changes in FSC/SSC caused by extreme protein aggregation in these studies. Changes in autofluorescence and morphology, and not dye activation, similarly accounted for increased fluorescence observed in antibiotic-treated  E. coli  ( Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ). Our findings with superoxide-generating menadione and hydroxyl radical-producing H 2 O 2  support the conclusion that bacterial exposure to even high levels of H 2 O 2  does not produce hydroxyl radicals at a level detectable by activation of CellROX Green and the conclusion by  Choi et al. (2015)  that CellROX Green is a sensitive detector of O 2  •–  in bacteria. 
       
       
         Basal Superoxide Levels Depend upon the Bacterial Metabolic State 
         Here, we tested the ability of CellROX Green to detect changes in O 2  •–  levels in cells in different states of respiration and growth. A major source of O 2  •–  in respiring cells involves reduction of O 2  by electrons leaking from the bacterial respiratory chain from NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome b and at the ubiquinone sites. In  E. coli , this respiration-dependent O 2  •–  production varies according to nutrient levels, at least at early times following changes in nutrient sources and levels ( Gonzalez-Flecha and Demple, 1995 ;  Turrens, 2003 ;  Korshunov and Imlay, 2006 ;  Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ;  Adolfsen and Brynildsen, 2015 ;  Lobritz et al., 2015 ). To assess the effects of active respiration on basal O 2  •–  levels, we performed CellROX Green staining after transferring actively dividing  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  into either 10% LB or 7H9 media, respectively, in PBS or into 100% PBS, both after washing twice in their respective media. After 30 min in the absence of LB or 7H9, in which cells have reduced respiration due to acute nutrient deprivation, both  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  had very low levels of activated CellROX Green fluorescence compared to the background signal from unstained cells ( Figures  3A,B  ). However, &gt;95% of both cell types in 10% media/90% PBS showed evidence of dye uptake and a uniform several order-of-magnitude increase in the CellROX hi  fluorscence ( Figures  3A,B  ). CellROX Green activation observed in cells in the presence of LB or 7H9 media is likely attributable to higher basal metabolism in the actively dividing cells, which leads to respiration-derived O 2  •–  ( Gonzalez-Flecha and Demple, 1995 ;  Turrens, 2003 ;  Korshunov and Imlay, 2006 ;  Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ;  Adolfsen and Brynildsen, 2015 ;  Lobritz et al., 2015 ).

         To verify that metabolically derived O 2  •–  is the predominant ROS species reacting with CellROX Green in these actively respiring cells, we quantified dye activation in  E. coli  knockout strains lacking SODs  sodA  and  sodB  and grown in LB to different states of cell density (early log, late log, and stationary phases). Cytosolic O 2  •–  is rapidly converted to H 2 O 2  by the SODs at diffusion-limited rates (k cat /K M  ∼7 × 10 9  M -1  s -1 ) ( Berg et al., 2002 ). As shown in  Figure  3B  , there is a significant increase in CellROX hi  cells among the strains lacking SOD compared to wild-type  E. coli . Further, by accounting for differences in cell numbers at early, mid-log and stationary cultures by adjusting for turbidity pre-treatment and events collected post-data acquisition ( Figure  3B  ), we recapitulated previous observations that metabolic O 2  •–  generation correlates with growth stage-dependent cellular metabolic activity rather than overall culture viability ( Yamashoji et al., 2001 ). These results provide further support for the conclusion that CellROX Green activation in bacteria is predominantly due to reactions with O 2  •– . 
       
       
         Antibiotic-Induced Superoxide Production 
         There is emerging and intriguing evidence for multiple roles for ROS in the bacterial response to antibiotic exposure ( Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Grant et al., 2012 ;  Dwyer et al., 2015 ). However, methods using ROS-reactive dyes to identify and quantify ROS in antibiotic-treated bacteria are prone to artifacts in the absence of rigorous controls. For example, drug-induced changes in cell morphology can increase background fluorescence instead of activating the dye ( Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ), the use of ROS-reactive dyes in batch culture methods does not inform about ROS inside cells ( Albesa et al., 2004 ), and there is disagreement about the ability of ROS-reactive dyes to gain entrance into bacteria such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and  M. smegmatis  ( Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Grant et al., 2012 ). In all of these cases, rigorous flow cytometric gating to control for dye uptake, cell morphology and background fluorescence could minimize these problems. Here, we illustrate this idea using CellROX Green to assess the relationship between ROS production and cytotoxicity in  M. smegmatis  treated with mechanistically distinct antibiotics known to be effective against mycobacteria: ethambutol (cell wall synthesis inhibitor), streptomycin (binds to 30S ribosome subunit), rifampicin (binds to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase), isoniazid (inhibits mycolic acid synthesis), kanamycin (binds to 30S ribosome subunit), and norfloxacin (topoisomerase inhibitor).  M. smegmatis  cytotoxicity dose-response curves for these antibiotics are shown in  Figure  4A  .

         We first assessed the effects of antibiotic exposures on FSC, SSC and background fluorescence in  M. smegmatis . As shown in Supplementary Figure  S3 , while there were no consistent changes in SSC or increased background fluorescence (in absence of dye), there were time-, dose- and antibiotic-dependent shifts to lower SSC in treated bacteria. Given the recognized link between SSC shift and bacterial cell cycle progression ( Walberg et al., 1997a , b ), elongation ( Renggli et al., 2013 ), and the uniquely asymmetric cell division of rod-shaped mycobacteria ( Kieser and Rubin, 2014 ), these results are consistent with a delayed cell elongation in  M. smegmatis  populations hours after the initial drug exposure. 
         After accounting for morphological changes in and background fluorescence, we next assessed antibiotic-induced O 2  •–  generation in  M. smegmatis  using CellROX Green. As shown in  Figures  4B,C  , antibiotics did not consistently cause O 2  •–  generation in  M. smegmatis . While ethambutol, rifampicin, and isoniazid increased CellROX hi  levels after 24 h of treatment ( Figure  4B  ) and as early as 3 h after treatment ( Figure  4C  ), norfloxacin and kanamycin treatments produced minimal or no dye-detectable ROS in response to 24 h treatment ( Figure  4B  ). For streptomycin, no dye-detectable ROS was observed after 3 h of exposure ( Figure  4C  ), while too many cells were killed at 24 h for accurate measurements. 
         Quantitative relationships between CellROX activation and cytotoxicity caused by the antibiotics were observed to be inconsistent in three studies. First, treatment with ethambutol produced dose-dependent killing while &gt;95% of the cells produced dye-detectable ROS across all tested doses ( Figures  4A,B  ). We then assessed antibiotic-induced toxicity by co-staining with propidium iodide (PI), a dye that is excluded from viable cells but enters cells with damaged membranes, and by survival as colony-forming units (CFUs). Based on flow cytometry contour plots, such as those in Supplementary Figures  S4A–C , uptake of PI and CellROX varied among antibiotic exposures. However, similar proportions of cells were stained with PI in both the total population ( Figure  4E  ) and the CellROX hi  population ( Figure  4F  ) at 24 h post-exposure. In a third set of studies, the inconsistency of ROS formation and cell toxicity was more pronounced in CFU cell death assays for both  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  (Supplementary Figure  S4D ). Together, these data suggest that the mechanisms by which antibiotics cause increased O 2  •–  production are unique to each antibiotic, and elevated steady-state O 2  •–  levels alone are not causative or predictive of cell death. 
         Finally, we assessed the formation of O 2  •–  in  M. smegmatis  clones induced to be resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, two antibiotics that caused significant O 2  •–  production ( Figures  4B,C  ). Antibiotic-tolerant bacteria were generated by culturing  M. smegmatis  in varying concentrations of antibiotics for 5 days. Despite several logs of killing by 20–30 μg/mL isoniazid and rifampicin at 24 h ( Figure  4A  ), 5 days of growth in the presence of the antibiotics led to a drug-resistant population ( Figure  4E  ). Compared to  M. smegmatis  treated for 24 h, the antibiotic-tolerant bacteria displayed greatly reduced O 2  •–  production following antibiotic exposures ( Figure  4F  ). Furthermore, there were fewer PI +  bacteria (i.e., bacteria with damaged membranes) and no positive correlation between PI staining and antibiotic concentration at 5 days was observed, in contrast with the same treatment after 24 h ( Figures  4E,G  ). The mechanisms by which bacteria became resistant to the antibiotics was not established. 
       
       
         Nutrient Deprivation Induces Superoxide Production and Antibiotic Tolerance in Mycobacteria 
         We next assessed O 2  •–  generation in mycobacteria in the well-established non-replicating and antibiotic-tolerant (i.e., persistent) physiological state caused by nutrient deprivation ( Xie et al., 2005 ;  Gengenbacher et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, starved bacteria consistently produced significantly higher levels of endogenous O 2  •–  than log-growing, nutrient-replete cells ( Figures  5A–C  ). This was not a quirk of  M. smegmatis  as we observed the same phenomenon in slow-growing  M. bovis  BCG when starved up to 22 days ( Figures  5A–C  ). Given this starvation-induced increase in basal O 2  •–  production and the observation that increased ROS levels render some bacteria susceptible to killing by specific antibiotics ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ;  Adolfsen and Brynildsen, 2015 ;  Belenky et al., 2015 ), we quantified antibiotic sensitivity of log-growing or starved (4, 10, 20 days) BCG with the front-line TB antibiotics isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, or streptomycin. As shown in  Figures  5D–G  , starved mycobacteria were tolerant to all four antibiotics compared to log-growing bacilli in spite of elevated basal O 2  •–  production. This idiosyncratic behavior of starvation-induced persisters led us to investigate the effect of antibiotic exposure on O 2  •–  levels in these cells. After accounting for elevated basal O 2  •–  caused by starvation, we found that generation of O 2  •–  in antibiotic-stressed, starved BCG was idiosyncratic to the antibiotic. While higher than basal levels of O 2  •–  were observed in log-growing BCG for isoniazid and ethambutol ( Figures  5J,K  ), as observed for  M. smegmatis  ( Figures  4B,C  ), elevated O 2  •–  generation above the basal level was not observed in starved BCG treated with streptomycin, isoniazid, or ethambutol ( Figures  5I–K  ), which agrees with other studies on antibiotic-related ROS in persisters ( Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Grant et al., 2012 ).

         A possible explanation for the lack of antibiotic-related endogenous O 2  •–  induction in starvation-induced persisters is metabolic quiescence. To test for metabolic activity in starved cells, we performed staining of starved BCG with CTC, CFDA, and DAPI. Enhanced respiratory activity was observed in a sub-population of cells, as evident in the increase of the CTC hi  sub-population during starvation and the reversal of CTC activation by incubation in nutrient-replete medium ( Figure  5L   and Supplementary Figure  S5A ). Starvation also increased cellular esterase activity as shown by a CFDA hi  sub-population ( Figure  5M   and Supplementary Figure  S4A ), which again is reversed by transfer to nutrient-replete medium. Together, these observations eliminate metabolic stasis as the cause of the muted ROS production in the response of starved BCG antibiotic exposure. 
         Another possible explanation for reduced O 2  •–  generation in antibiotic-exposed non-replicating mycobacteria is the active exclusion of drugs through efflux pumps. Indeed, drug efflux pumps are often up-regulated in drug-tolerant cells ( Sarathy et al., 2013 ;  Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014 ). However, we observed that rifampicin treatment induced O 2  •–  generation in a dose-dependent manner in both log and starved BCG ( Figure  5H  ), in spite of starvation-induced up-regulation of transcription of a known rifampicin efflux pump, BCG_1316c ( M. tuberculosis  Rv1258c homolog) ( Adams et al., 2011 ) (Supplementary Figure  S5B ). Even with enhanced O 2  •–  production above an already high basal level, rifampicin treatment did not result in cell death ( Figure  5D  ), indicating that starved BCG is refractory to O 2  •– -mediated killing, unlike log-growing  E. coli  ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ;  Adolfsen and Brynildsen, 2015 ;  Belenky et al., 2015 ). These findings demonstrate that antibiotic-induced O 2  •–  production and associated killing is both antibiotic- and cell state-dependent. 
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       The use of fluorescent probes combined with flow cytometry is a powerful approach to investigate biological processes within single cells as well as in cell populations. We developed a four-step gating strategy to minimize false positive signals and artifacts by accounting for DNA content, changes in cell morphology, dye uptake and retention, and target specific dye activation in bacterial cells. This approach is generally applicable to intracellular metabolic probes, as illustrated here with CellROX Green, CTC and CFDA-AM. With specific application to CellROX Green, the flow cytometry method provides high-dimensional quantitative measurement of light scatter and fluorescence emission by this O 2  •– -activated fluorescent probe, thus allowing measurement of O 2  •–  in 1000s of individual cells within a sample in addition to the population abundance. 
       The four-step gating scheme presented here makes use of several well-accepted gating strategies for mammalian cells and systematically applies them to bacteria at each of the four steps. The basis for  Step 1  is the selection of the cell population of interest based on scatter properties, such as when selecting for lymphocytes versus monocytes or granulocytes. Although commonly used in environmental microbiology, scatter properties of bacteria have not been considered in ROS probe-based studies. DNA content staining, as in  Step 2 , although not absolutely necessary, strengthens the precision and accuracy of the data by distinguishing bacteria from particles of similar sizes. It also provides an additional parameter for analysis along with FSC and SSC, which together can distinguish different bacteria or bacteria in different cell states ( Muller and Nebe-von-Caron, 2010 ). Finally, DNA content gives information about life cycle stages within the population that may provide insight into stress response mechanisms. 
       While large aggregates and dramatic filamentation would be excluded in our plots due to the flow cytometer settings for FSC (only particles &lt;10 um are collected during analysis), the gating scheme does not necessarily ignore elongated cells and instead accounts for their elongation. By taking into account increases in fluorescence observed in cells with higher SSC or FSC (done by two-dimensional gating such as SSC versus fluorescence), cells with increased SSC or FSC can be selected for analysis if they pass the subsequent gates for increases in green fluorescence to be considered Dye +  and then CellROX hi . This gating procedure normalizes for changes in SSC by not using flat cutoffs as in histograms (e.g., cut-off at fluorescence of 2 × 10 3 ). If one does see two distinct populations of cells, separate size gates (FSC, SSC) or DNA content gates can be made for each population followed by consistent gating for green fluorescence. The changes in background green fluorescence are not the same magnitude as activated CellROX Green dye, so generation of ROS in cells with high background staining should be distinguishable using unstained and stained treated cells. 
       Together,  Steps 3  and  4  of the gating scheme select for probe fluorescence inside cells, which validates the location of the probe reaction with ROS.  Step 3  selects all cells with fluorescence above no-dye controls. This basal fluorescence must be considered a conservative, baseline signal that accounts for detection of unreacted, reacted, or degraded dye in the cell or, less likely, adhering to the cell surface, as well as fluorescence from intracellular components. Considering that culture conditions, bacterial species, and stress can affect dye permeability in some bacteria ( Walberg et al., 1999 ), an assessment of dye content in each cell becomes important, whenever possible. The point of gating  Step 3  is a conservative one: to minimize noise and artifacts by including in the analysis only cells that appear to have taken up a dye molecule. By setting the selection threshold for  Step 4  above these basal levels,  Step 4  selects cells with a high probability of containing an ROS-activated dye molecule. It is important to use the Dye +  gate as the denominator for determining positive ROS signals as different stress treatments change the basal fluorescence. 
       There are several advantages to this a four-step gating flow cytometry method. ROS in bacterial populations have been evaluated with fluorescent dyes using plate readers or by measuring mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in total cell populations collected using a flow cytometer ( Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Dwyer et al., 2012 ,  2014 ). However, the problem with these approaches is that, depending upon the gating of the flow cytometer data, the use of controls, and rigorous characterization of the dye sensitivity and specificity, these fluorescence methods can yield false positives due to background fluorescence from the dye or the treatment, as reported previously and observed in the present studies ( Renggli et al., 2013 ;  Paulander et al., 2014 ). Plate reader data also suffers from artifacts of extracellular fluorescence. Moreover, mean or median changes in fluorescence in total populations may reflect a small proportion of cells producing high levels of ROS or a large proportion generating low to moderate amounts of ROS. Given evidence for the intracellular ROS concentration as a determinant of cellular responses to specific antibiotics ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ), the ability to both identify ROS and measure ROS abundance at the single cell level is vital to understanding mechanisms of cellular responses. The strategy presented here for detection of ROS with a flow cytometer combined with rigorous gating of populations allows for determination of relative abundance of ROS generation within single cells. One of the advantages of using CellROX Green activation as a O 2  •–  index in bacteria involves retention of activated dye in cells by binding to DNA, which prevents loss of activated probe through efflux pumps or leakage through damaged cell membranes. 
       In terms of the chemical identify of the ROS species detected by CellROX Green, we conclude that this dye selectively detects O 2  •–  in bacterial populations under a variety of environmental conditions and exposures. Our results with menadione exposure and SOD mutant strains are consistent with published studies pointing to CellROX Green specificity for O 2  •–  in bacterial cells ( Choi et al., 2015 ). We cannot rule out dye activation by RNS such as peroxynitrite (ONOO - ), the reaction product of NO and O 2  •– , which decays to generate nitrogen dioxide radical ( ∙ NO 2 ) and hydroxyl radical ( Dedon and Tannenbaum, 2004 ). However, it is unlikely that, even with high O 2  •–  levels, there would be significant ONOO -  formation in bacteria under the exposure conditions used here. The relative insignificance of hydroxyl radicals generated from ONOO -  is further emphasized by the fact that even high, supra-lethal concentrations of H 2 O 2 , which is well-established to react with reducing metals to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals or equivalently reactive ferryl radicals ( Imlay et al., 1988 ;  Imlay, 2015 ), did not produce detectable activation of CellROX Green. This points to either a relative insensitivity of the dye to hydroxyl radicals  in vivo  or to production of significantly lower levels of hydroxyl radicals relative to O 2  •–  in the cells. H 2 O 2  can also lead to indirect ROS and RNS production in cells by activating redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as OxyR and PerR in bacteria, to remodel cell metabolism and energetics, with resulting increases in O 2  •–  and other dye-reactive radical species ( Marinho et al., 2014 ). Again, the lack of H 2 O 2 -induced CellROX Green activation rules out such a mechanism. H 2 O 2 -induced metabolic remodeling may explain the activation of CellROX Green in H 2 O 2 -exposed human cells ( Segard et al., 2013 ). However, our studies reveal a lack of dye-detectable ROS species in bacteria exposed to supra-lethal levels of H 2 O 2 . Clearly the interpretation of studies using H 2 O 2  as a calibrant in dye-based studies of ROS generation should be approached with caution. 
       The results of our studies with  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  reveal several types of heterogeneity and idiosyncrasy in the bacterial ROS responses to chemical stimuli, which warrant customization of the dye-based ROS method and caution in interpreting the results. For example, both types of bacteria showed different responses to menadione as a population (visualized in fluorescence histograms –  Figures  2B,D  ). With increasing menadione exposures, a dose-dependent increase in size of the CellROX hi 
 M. smegmatis  sub-population was observed. However, there was no change in the population distribution as demonstrated by the absence of any change in the mean, median or mode fluorescence intensity ( Figure  2B  ). In contrast, two distinct populations emerged during menadione stress for  E. coli . This change in population distribution was most evident at high menadione concentrations when a significant increase in the mean, median and mode fluorescence intensity between low and high menadione exposures was observed ( Figure  2D  ). While we do not have a mechanistic explanation for this behavior, we note that it is a consistent and reproducible shift in the size of the CellROX hi  subpopulation in response to menadione indicating O 2  •–  stress. It cannot be ruled out, however, that in longer exposures to menadione, further fluorescence shifts in the population of both  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  would occur. However, under current conditions, the two bacteria both produce CellROX Green-detected ROS, but with different staining patterns. These differences between  E. coli  and  M. smegmatis  suggest caution in extrapolating ROS results across bacterial species and genera. In some cases, it is not even possible to compare across different types of bacteria to due dye accessibility problems. We shared the same problem experienced by  Grant et al. (2012)  that HPF could not be used to detect ROS in  M. smegmatis  even though it works with  E. coli . 
       This same caution in interpreting the results of ROS dye signals and extrapolating results across species must be applied to studies of antibiotic pharmacodynamics. While fluorescent probes have been used to explore ROS generation caused by antibiotic exposure ( Kohanski et al., 2007 ;  Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Dwyer et al., 2012 ,  2014 ;  Grant et al., 2012 ), there is no unifying mechanistic model to explain why ROS are generated with specific antibiotics in some bacterial species but not others, and, more importantly, which type of ROS is generated. Our findings with CellROX Green in  M. smegmatis  and  E. coli  under the variety of conditions that cause increases in dye-detectable ROS lead us to conclude that O 2  •–  generation (1) is not a universal feature of antibiotic stress, (2) does not distinguish bactericidal from bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (3) is not generally predictive of cell death ( Figure  4I  ). Rather, our data suggest that ROS production is dependent on the physiological state of the cell, specifically on changes in metabolism. Previous studies of ROS metabolism in antibiotic tolerant bacteria revealed clear differences in the drug-host interaction ( Nguyen et al., 2011 ;  Maisonneuve and Gerdes, 2014 ). Similarly, our observation of O 2  •–  production during rifampicin treatment may be related to enzyme induction and metabolism, as the antibiotic is a potent inducer of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, most notably CYP3A4 and CYP2C subfamily ( Madan et al., 2003 ). This suggests that rifampicin may also induce CYPs in mycobacteria ( Niemi et al., 2003 ). Since CYP activity is well-known to generate high levels of O 2  •–  ( Denisov et al., 2005 ;  Munro et al., 2013 ), our observation of dose-dependent CellROX Green activation in both log-growing and starved bacilli following rifampicin exposure ( Figures  4B , 6B ) is consistent with previous studies showing transcriptional up-regulation of different CYPs in mycobacteria following exposure to a variety of antibiotics ( Boshoff et al., 2004 ). Indeed, recently released microarray datasets for transcriptional response to antibacterial agents in the closely related human pathogen,  M. tuberculosis , shows that several CYPs, including  cyp51  (Rv0764c),  cyp124  (Rv2266),  cyp135A1  (Rv0327c) and  cyp139  (Rv1666c), are upregulated in response to rifampicin (NCBI Gene Ontology Omnibus Accession: GSE71200). 
       The presence of elevated basal ROS levels in starved mycobacteria might suggest a vulnerability in light of evidence that antibiotic-induced “ROS” potentiate existing ROS to promote bacterial cell death ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2014 ;  Adolfsen and Brynildsen, 2015 ;  Belenky et al., 2015 ). However, our observations in mycobacteria do not support this as a universal model. For instance, the non-replicating, antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria generated through nutrient deprivation have elevated O 2  •–  ( Figure  5D  ), yet are significantly resistant to four front-line tuberculosis antibiotics ( Figures  5D–G  ). While endogenous ROS production has been correlated with antibiotic killing in some cases ( Brynildsen et al., 2013 ;  Dwyer et al., 2015 ), increases in intracellular O 2  •–  levels in starved mycobacteria failed to potentiate the activities of several antibiotics. This observation also raises concerns about the conclusion that the O 2  •– -generating tuberculosis antibiotic clofazimine, which also binds tightly to DNA and RNA, facilitates INH-induced killing of persistent  M. smegmatis  by virtue of O 2  •–  production ( Grant et al., 2012 ). It is possible that clofazimine’s cytotoxic activity involves tight binding of its reduced, free radical form to DNA and RNA, as demonstrated for the parent compound ( Morrison and Marley, 1976 ), to create covalent adducts. In any event, our results demonstrate that O 2  •–  is unlikely to be the cause of toxicity in persistent or drug-resistant non-replicating mycobacteria. 
       Finally, we address the impact of potential heterogeneity in what appears to be toxicant-induced changes in uptake of dye molecules into individual cells. This issue becomes apparent, for example, in the increased proportion of cells appearing in the Dye +  gate following menadione treatment ( Figure  2E  ), which correlates with the proportion of cells with a fluorescence signal greater than untreated cells (CellROX hi ;  Figures  2A,C  ). What appears to be a toxicant-induced increase in the number of cells taking up dye raises the concerns that an increased CellROX hi  signal could occur in spite of constant toxicant-independent ROS levels (more dye molecules to activate) or as a result of a large influx of unactivated, weakly fluorescent parent dye molecules. It is important to point out that the flow cytometry method is limited in its ability to precisely quantify the contribution of toxicant-induced increases in dye uptake of individual cells, such as increased permeability to CellROX Green or reduced efflux of the dye. However, the nature of the gating strategy, the cell permeability and spectroscopic properties of the fluorescent dye, and our observations of membrane permeability changes using PI argue that stress-induced increases in CellROX Green fluorescence are truly due to increases in O 2  •–  levels in the cells. First, the Dye +  gate precedes CellROX hi  gating, so the latter is a subset of the former and, in a rising tide argument, increases in the Dye +  population will naturally accompany increases in the CellROX hi  population. The Dye +  gate of increased fluorescence above unstained cells is intended to be a conservative barrier to rule out artifacts, so it is possible that untreated cells taking up smaller amounts of the weakly fluorescent dye will be gated out of the analysis for the sake of accuracy at the cost of sensitivity, while increases in ROS levels in treated cells will raise the fluorescence of these previously missed low-dye cells above the threshold for Dye + . Second, our analysis of antibiotic exposure and ROS in  Figure  4   revealed that there is no correlation between antibiotic-induced changes in membrane permeability (PI staining) and the magnitude of the CellROX hi  signal: ETM caused the highest CellROX Green fluorescence ( Figures  4B,C  ) and the lowest membrane damage ( Figures  4E,F  ). Third, CellROX Green is a cell-permeant dye, so its concentration should equilibrate between bulk solvent and cell interior. The spectroscopic properties of CellROX Green imply that very high levels of unactivated dye must accumulate in a cell to produce a signal that rivals the magnitude of ROS-activated dye. Assuming that CellROX Green has spectral properties roughly similar to HPF, then both molar absorptivity and quantum efficiency are greatly increased by ROS activation: &gt;3-fold and &gt;100-fold, respectively ( Setsukinai et al., 2003 ). This implies that an approximately &gt;1000-fold increase in intracellular CellROX Green concentration would be needed to produce the equivalent of a 10-fold increase in ROS-activated CellROX Green fluorescence above the mean (or median or mode) fluorescence of the population. The additional requirement for DNA binding to achieve the enhanced fluorescence by ROS-activated CellROX Green ( Invitrogen, 2010 ,  2012 ,  2016 ) further reduces the likelihood that unactivated dye could account for toxicant-induced changes in CellROX hi . This is also consistent with the observation by  Choi et al. (2015)  that permeabilization of the  E. coli  cell membrane/wall by Triton X-100 did not alter CellROX Green fluorescence. Finally, if the increased fluorescence in cells were simply due to increased dye concentration, then there would not be multiple distinct cell populations observed on the flow cytometer (e.g.,  Figure  2D  ). All of this evidence rules out toxicant- and stress-induced changes in dye uptake as the basis for increased CellROX hi  detection of ROS. 
       Taken together, the results of our studies demonstrate that properly controlled flow cytometry coupled with fluorescent probes provides precise and accurate quantitative analysis of ROS generation and metabolic changes in stressed bacteria. The gating strategy provides for a consistent comparison based on specific parameters across multiple samples in spite of changes in cellular morphology or background fluorescence. Application of this method with CellROX Green and diverse bacteria reveals that superoxide generation arises idiosyncratically due to transient or phenotypic alterations in cell physiology caused by environmental or chemical stresses and is itself not a primary driver of bacterial death.

         The striatum is key for action-selection and the motivation to move. Dopamine and acetylcholine release sites are enriched in the striatum and are cross-regulated, possibly to achieve optimal behavior. Drugs of abuse, which promote abnormally high dopamine release, disrupt normal action-selection and drive restricted, repetitive behaviors (stereotypies). Stereotypies occur in a variety of disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia and Huntington's disease, as well as in addictive states. The severity of drug-induced stereotypy is correlated with induction of c-Fos expression in striosomes, a striatal compartment that is related to the limbic system and that directly projects to dopamine-producing neurons of the substantia nigra. These characteristics of striosomes contrast with the properties of the extra-striosomal matrix, which has strong sensorimotor and associative circuit inputs and outputs. Disruption of acetylcholine signaling in the striatum blocks the striosome-predominant c-Fos expression pattern induced by drugs of abuse and alters drug-induced stereotypy. The activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons is associated with behaviors related to sensory cues, and cortical inputs to striosomes can bias action-selection in the face of conflicting cues. The neurons and neuropil of striosomes and matrix neurons have observably separate distributions, both at the input level in the striatum and at the output level in the substantia nigra. Notably, cholinergic axons readily cross compartment borders, providing a potential route for local cross-compartment communication to maintain a balance between striosomal and matrix activity. We show here, by slice electrophysiology in transgenic mice, that repetitive evoked firing patterns in striosomal and matrix striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are interrupted by optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons either by the addition or the deletion of spikes. We demonstrate that this cholinergic modulation of projection neurons is blocked in brain slices taken from mice exposed to amphetamine and engaged in amphetamine-induced stereotypy, and lacking responsiveness to salient cues. Our findings support a model whereby activity in striosomes is normally under strong regulation by cholinergic interneurons, favoring behavioral flexibility, but that in animals with drug-induced stereotypy, this cholinergic signaling breaks down, resulting in differential modulation of striosomal activity and an inability to bias action-selection according to relevant sensory cues.

       Introduction 
       Pathologically repetitive and restricted behaviors, known as stereotypies, occur in numerous disorders and are notably difficult to disrupt, suggesting a failure in attention to environmental cues that might normally direct a change in behavior. Stereotypies can also be induced in humans and other animals by high doses of habit-forming drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. Animals with drug-induced stereotypic behavior exhibit high c-Fos immediate-early gene induction in striatal projection neurons (SPNs) within the striosome compartment of the striatum, relative to low activation in SPNs located in the surrounding matrix compartment (Canales and Graybiel,  2000 ; Tan et al.,  2000 ; Saka et al.,  2004 ; Crittenden and Graybiel,  2011 ,  2016 ; Horner et al.,  2012 ; Jedynak et al.,  2012 ). Such differential c-Fos induction in striosomes, relative to c-Fos induction in the matrix, is blocked by intrastriatal ablation of cholinergic interneurons (referred to herein as ChIs), along with somatostatin-expressing interneurons (Saka et al.,  2002 ), and manipulations of ChI signaling have a direct impact on the severity of cocaine- and amphetamine-induced stereotypies (Schoffelmeer et al.,  2002 ; Collins and Izenwasser,  2004 ; Thomsen et al.,  2010 ; Aliane et al.,  2011 ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). High-dose drug treatments also are related to an imbalance in activity of cortical regions that differentially project to the striatal striosome or matrix compartment (Gerfen,  1984 ; Kincaid and Wilson,  1996 ; Aliane et al.,  2009 ; Friedman et al.,  2015 ; Kupferschmidt et al.,  2015 ). All together, these findings suggest that a balance in activity between striosome-based and matrix-based cortico-basal ganglia loops could be critical for behavioral flexibility. 
       In contrast to the widespread interconnections that occur among the D1- and D2-dopamine receptor-positive SPNs of the direct and indirect output pathways (Taverna et al.,  2008 ), SPNs that lie in the striosome or matrix compartments seem particularly separated, not only physically but also electrophysiologically (Kawaguchi et al.,  1989 ; Banghart et al.,  2015 ; Lopez-Huerta et al.,  2016 ), though with some cross-compartment crossing of their processes (Bolam et al.,  1988 ; Walker et al.,  1993 ). Striosomal SPNs give rise to a unique striatonigral connection to subgroups of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta that produce dopamine (Gerfen,  1985 ; Jimenez-Castellanos and Graybiel,  1989 ; Fujiyama et al.,  2011 ; Watabe-Uchida et al.,  2012 ; Crittenden et al.,  2016 ), a neurotransmitter that is released by all known drugs of abuse and is a key driver of motivated behaviors and movement initiation (Schultz,  2011 ; Dodson et al.,  2016 ; Howe and Dombeck,  2016 ). Further, the striosome-targeted dopamine-positive neurons project back both to striosomes and matrix, suggesting a circuit by which striosomes could exert both localized and global control over the dorsal striatum (Crittenden et al.,  2016 ). For technical reasons, few studies have addressed how striosomal neurons are regulated, and striosomes are difficult targets because they comprise only ~15–20% of the SPN populations, which primarily occupy the extrastriosomal matrix that houses the cells of origin of the classic direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways for motor control. Yet striosomes are preferential targets of some cortical regions related to the limbic system, and they target lateral habenula-linked circuits and the dopamine-containing nigral pars compacta, both implicated in motivation and reinforcement-driven behaviors. Thus, striosomal SPNs, insofar as they act through their main GABAergic neurotransmitter mechanism, are well placed to counterbalance hyper-activation of the dopamine system. 
       The relative segregation of striosomal and matrix SPNs raises the question of what mechanisms maintain the normal balance of the striatal compartments, including the balanced expression of immediate-early gene products, such as c-Fos, expression that becomes striosome-predominant in animals exhibiting drug-induced stereotypy. ChIs and other interneurons that are located along the striosomal borders are leading candidates for coordinating activity between the two compartments (Graybiel et al.,  1986 ; Sandell et al.,  1986 ; Kubota and Kawaguchi,  1993 ; Aosaki et al.,  1995 ; Mounir and Parent,  2002 ; Miura et al.,  2007 ; Brimblecombe and Cragg,  2015 ). ChIs are thought to correspond to the tonically active neurons of the striatum (TANs), which respond to salient or instructive stimuli with an activation, pause and rebound pattern of activity (Apicella et al.,  1991 ; Aosaki et al.,  1995 ; Blazquez et al.,  2002 ; Minamimoto and Kimura,  2002 ; Goldberg and Reynolds,  2011 ; Doig et al.,  2014 ; Thorn and Graybiel,  2014 ). This cue-response is semi-synchronized among TANs across the striatum and is driven by input from the neocortex and from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which are themselves activated by sensory inputs (Aosaki et al.,  1995 ; Matsumoto et al.,  2001 ; Morris et al.,  2004 ; Brown et al.,  2010 ; Doig et al.,  2014 ). Strategic switching behaviors exhibited in learning tasks are impacted by manipulations of ChIs in the striatum (Minamimoto et al.,  2005 ; McCool et al.,  2008 ; Brown et al.,  2010 ; Okada et al.,  2014 ). The extreme loss of behavioral flexibility that occurs in animals engaged in drug-induced stereotypies is likewise modulated by cholinergic manipulations (Schoffelmeer et al.,  2002 ; Collins and Izenwasser,  2004 ; Thomsen et al.,  2010 ; Aliane et al.,  2011 ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). These findings suggest that thalamic and cortical input to the ChIs of the dorsal striatum helps to re-set motor systems to modulate behavioral flexibility in the face of conflicting cues or drug-induced overload of the dopamine system (Ding et al.,  2010 ; Minamimoto et al.,  2014 ; Eskow Jaunarajs et al.,  2015 ). Whether striosomal and matrix SPNs are differentially controlled by ChIs, however, has not been tested. We now have performed such a test, and have specifically asked whether we could estimate the ChIs modulation of SPN firing activity related to amphetamine-induced stereotypies by examining SPN responses in slices prepared from animals actively engaged in such behaviors. 
       It is known from much work on striatal slices that activation of ChIs induces GABA release from local sources to drive inhibitory responses in SPNs (Miura et al.,  2006 ; English et al.,  2012 ; Luo et al.,  2013 ; Nelson et al.,  2014b ; Faust et al.,  2016 ). These measurements have been made without identification of striatal compartments, but likely were made mostly in the large matrix compartment. Inoue and colleagues (Inoue et al.,  2016 ) have now identified striosomes in a brain slice recording preparation by using young transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (Matsushita et al.,  2002 ), which is striosome-enriched in young mice (&lt;28 days of age). Paired neuronal recordings in these mice demonstrated that SPNs, and other ChIs, can inhibit ChIs within and across compartments (Inoue et al.,  2016 ), consistent with the fact that ChI neuropil crosses compartment borders (Graybiel et al.,  1986 ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). Whether ChI activation induces the prominent pause in activity in both striosomal and matrix SPNs was not examined. 
       We performed slice recordings and optogenetic stimulation of ChIs in double transgenic mice that have matrix-enriched GFP and channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in ChIs. Wide-field application of a blue light pulse to the slices induced a single spike in the ChIs. We show here that this ChI stimulation produced a brief inhibition of evoked, repetitive firing in both striosomal and matrix SPNs. We also observed, in SPNs of both the matrix and striosomes, that the optogenetic activation of ChIs occasionally induced a spike-advance in the SPN firing pattern. All of these effects were blocked by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE). Furthermore, in brain slices taken from drug-treated transgenic mice engaged in amphetamine-induced stereotypies and non-respondent to salient cues, ChI stimulation failed to disrupt the evoked repetitive striosomal and matrix SPN firing. These results raise the proposal, favored here, that the loss of behavioral flexibility that occurs in animals under the influence of psychomotor stimulants could result from a failure in the ability of ChIs to reset ongoing striatal activity and motor behavior in response to relevant environmental cues.

         Mice 
         All procedures were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is AAALAC accredited. Table  1  summarizes mouse lines used. Double transgenic mice were generated from intercrosses of single hemizygous mice so that no offspring were homozygous for a transgene. ChAT-IRES-Cre knock-in mice (JAX stock #006410) (Rossi et al.,  2011 ) were on a mixed 129S6, C57Bl/6J genetic background. Mice with the ChAT-ChR2-EYFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (Zhao et al.,  2011 ) were on a C57Bl/6 genetic background. CalDAG-GEFI (aka RasGRP2)-EGFP BAC mice (Gong et al.,  2003 ) were on a FVB/N-Swiss Webster hybrid background. For neuroanatomical studies, ChAT-IRES-Cre knock-in mice were crossed to Ai32(RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP) knock-in mice (JAX stock #024109) (Madisen et al.,  2012 ) on a C57Bl/6 background. Experimental mice were male, 2–6 months of age, and housed under a standard light-dark cycle (lights on at 7 am and off at 7 pm), with free access to food and water. Mice with intracerebral viral injections were single-housed post-surgery, and mice that were D-amphetamine-treated were single-housed. Otherwise mice were group-housed with brothers.

         Tissue preparation, immunolabeling, and microscopy 
         Mice were anesthetized with Euthasol (Virbac AH Inc.; pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium) and then trans-cardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M NaKPO 4  buffer solution (PBS). Brains were then dissected, post-fixed for 90 min, stored in 20% glycerin sinking solution overnight or longer, and cut into transverse sections at 30 μm on a freezing microtome. Sections were stored in 0.1% sodium azide in 0.1 M PBS until use. Free-floating sections were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and then were blocked in TSA Blocking Reagent (Perkin Elmer) prior to incubation for 1 or 2 nights with immunosera against GFP (Aves Lab, GFP-1020, 1:500 dilution), yellow fluorescent protein (Abcam, Ab6556, 1:2,000 dilution), mu-opioid receptor subtype 1 (MOR1) (Abcam, Ab134054, 1:500 dilution), CalDAG-GEFI (#3752, 1:5,000, dilution) (Crittenden et al.,  2004 ), c-Fos (Santa Cruz, sc-52, 1:10,000 dilution), or vesicular acetylcholine transferase (VAChT) (Millipore, AB1588, 1:100) followed by the appropriate secondary antisera coupled to ALEXA fluorophores (ThermoFisher Scientific, 1:300). Following secondary incubation, sections were rinsed in 0.1 M PBS, mounted on subbed glass slides and coverslipped with ProLong antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with Zen Software and the data were processed and analyzed with Fiji software (Schindelin et al.,  2012 ). 
       
       
         Amphetamine treatments and behavioral tests 
         Mice were injected at ~10 am in their home cage for 3 days with saline only (10 ml/kg/day, i.p.) followed by 7 daily injections of D-amphetamine (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in saline (7 mg/kg/day, 10 ml/kg, i.p.), or saline vehicle, followed by 7 days without treatment and then a final challenge with amphetamine (7 mg/kg) or saline. To measure behavior on challenge day, the bedding (nestlet) was removed from the cages of the test mice, the mice received their challenge injection of D-amphetamine (or saline for the control mice) and, 30 min later, a ball of bedding was introduced from a mixture from 10 cages of female mice. Saline-treated mice were challenged again with saline 7 days later and the same test was done, but with bedding re-introduced from their own home cage. Mice were videotaped and their behavior was scored for a 2 min period beginning at 5 min after the introduction of the cage bedding. An experimenter blinded to mouse treatment scored the videotapes using a keyboard scoring system with the public domain software JWatcher™, version 1.0 (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, and Macquarie University, Sidney, Australia,  http://www.jwatcher.ucla.edu/ ). Individual keys were assigned to score resting, locomotion, sniffing or touching bedding, and highly confined stereotypy. The interaction of saline-treated mice with female cage bedding vs. their own home cage bedding was compared by a paired-sample, 2-tailed Student's  t -tests. The interaction of amphetamine-treated mice vs. saline-treated mice with female cage bedding was compared by an unpaired, 2-tailed Student's  t -test. Statistical analysis of amphetamine-induced stereotypy and interaction with female bedding was made on mice that carry the ChAT-Cre transgene alone, but equivalent severe stereotypy was observed in all double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice that were used for recording and c-Fos induction experiments. 
       
       
         Intrastriatal viral injections 
         ChAT-IRES-Cre mice or double transgenic, CalDAG-GEFI-EGFP-BAC;ChAT-IRES-Cre mice and CalDAG-GEFI-EGFP-BAC;ChAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC mice were maintained in deep anesthesia with a continuous flow of 2% isoflurane (Southmedic Inc.) in an oxygen mixture, delivered by a nose-cone attached to a stereotaxic frame. Mice were given bilateral intrastriatal injections, via NanoFil microsyringe (World Precision Instruments), of AAV5 encoding EF1αDIO hChR2(H134R)-mCherry (University of N. Carolina vector core), 0.75 μl per site, at the following stereotactic coordinates (AP = 0.9 mm, ML = −1.9 mm and +1.9 mm, DV = 2.0 mm and 2.7 mm, relative to bregma). Mice were allowed to fully recover from surgery for 2 weeks prior to the initiation of saline or D-amphetamine injections. 
       
       
          In vitro  slice preparation and patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings 
         For patch-clamp recording experiments, double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice and CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC mice were given saline or drug treatments beginning at ~2 weeks after intrastriatal viral injection. At 30 min post-injection of saline or drug on the challenge day, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (tribromoethanol) (0.25 mg/g, i.p.), and brain slices were prepared for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Slice preparation and recordings were made by an experimenter blinded to the treatment conditions. Mice (2–6 months old) were anesthetized with Avertin (tribromoethanol, 0.25 mg/g, i.p.), and the brains were rapidly removed and immersed in an ice-cold (4°C) slicing solution containing (in mM): 105 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 105 mM HCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 25 mM glucose, 2 mM thiourea, 1 mM Na-ascorbate, 3 mM Na-pyruvate, 0.5 mM CaCl 2 ·4H 2 O, and 10 mM MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O. The pH of the solution was titrated to 7.4 with concentrated HCl equilibrated with 95% O 2  and 5% CO 2 , pH 7.4. Coronal corticostriatal slices (270 μm) were cut with a Leica VT1200 microtome. The slices were incubated, initially in the above slicing solution, for 10 min at 32°C, then for 40 min and subsequently at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 124 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl 2 ·4H 2 O, 1 mM MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, equilibrated with 95% O 2  and 5% CO 2 , pH 7.4. The osmolality of all solutions was measured at 300–310 mOsm. Brain slices were transferred from the incubation chamber to the recording chamber and superfused with warmed (32°C), equilibrated (95% O 2  and 5% CO 2 ) ACSF at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from visually identified dorsolateral striatal neurons with an Olympus BX-51WI microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with Nomarski optics, infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) optics (900 nm) and epifluorescence. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from visually identified neurons using borosilicate glass pipettes (King Precision Glass, Inc., Glass type 8250) pulled (P-1000, Sutter Instruments) to a resistance of 2–5 MΩ when filled with the internal solution containing 131 mM K-Gluconate, 17.5 mM KCl, 9 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Mg-ATP, 0.2 mM Na 2 -GTP, and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH (290–300 mOsm). In all recording conditions, access resistance was monitored and cells were included for analysis only if the series resistance was &lt;25 MΩ and the change of resistance was &lt;15% over the course of the experiment. A Digidata 1440A digitizer and pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) were used for data acquisition and analysis, and signals were amplified with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). A holding command of −70 mV was applied to the patched cell, and once the whole-cell mode was established, the cell was allowed to stabilize for 5–10 min. Both SPNs and ChIs were identified by cell-body size and shape and by intrinsic membrane properties. In current-clamp mode, light application evoked depolarization and action potentials in identified mCherry-positive ChIs in all except for one drug-treated, CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mouse that was therefore dropped from the study. In the single transgenic, virally injected ChAT-Cre knock-in mice and double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice, a blue LED pulse (10 ms) was used to stimulate ChIs. In the double BAC transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP;ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice, a hand-controlled shutter was briefly opened to activate the ChIs. For analysis of action potentials in SPNs, each SPN was maintained at resting membrane potential and injected for 800 ms with depolarization currents of 20–200 pA (enough current injection for adequate action potential firing). After a rest of 30 s, the same current sweep was repeated, this time with blue light application at 500 ms after the beginning of current injection. After 1 min of rest, another such pair of no-light/light current sweeps was given but with a slightly higher current injection to induce higher frequency firing. A total of 3 or 4 pairs of no-light/light current sweeps were given to each cell. 
         In recordings from two CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice, and additional experiments with double BAC transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP;ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice, DHβE (1 mM; Tocris, Bristol, UK) was added to the perfusate after the initial recordings and slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before repetition of action potential measurements. 
       
       
         Electrophysiological data analyses 
         Data were obtained and recorded in ClampFit (Molecular Devices), and the output abf files were converted in MiniAnalysis (SynaptoSoft) to assign the timestamp of each spike. For spike density functions, a 1 kHz sampling rate was used. The value 1 was assigned at each sample that corresponded to a spike time, and the remaining samples were assigned the value 0. The resulting time series was then smoothed with a Hanning window whose half-width was 80 ms. 
         For the Grubbs' test to identify outlier interspike intervals (ISIs), trials of two sweeps (one without blue light pulse, one with) were selected based on the following criteria: (1) the combined pre-light baseline period contained at least 7 ISIs, (2) the pre-light period contained at least two ISIs (no trial failed this test after passing the first test), (3) the combined pre-light baseline ISIs were normally distributed according to the Lilliefors test with alpha = 0.001 (this low alpha value was chosen because of the small sample sizes under examination), and (4) the combined pre-light baseline ISIs did not contain any outliers as determined by the Grubbs' test. All but one neuron had at least one analyzable trial, although in most cases the first trials had too few spikes to analyze. The first ISI was discarded because in some instances it appeared to be longer than the remaining ones. To test for a significant “advanced spike” response, the minimum ISI recorded during the post-light period was added to the pre-light baseline set of ISIs, and the Grubbs' test for an outlier was performed. To test for a “pause” response, the Grubbs' test was performed again but with the maximum post-light ISI added to the pre-light baseline set. If the duration between the last spike of the trial and the termination of current injection was longer than the longest recorded ISI, it was used in place of the maximum ISI. As two Grubbs' tests were performed on each of 123 trials that met our criteria, we used the Bonferroni correction for 246 comparisons to set alpha = 0.0002, corresponding to a  p  level of 0.05 for the entire set of comparisons. 
         The Lilliefors statistical test was performed using the Matlab function “lillietest.” Other tests were performed by in-house code written around the Matlab functions “chi2cdf” (Chi squared tests) and “tinv” (Grubbs' test). 
       
     
     
       Results 
       
         Mice engaged in amphetamine-induced repetitive behaviors fail to respond to a sensory cue and exhibit striosome-enriched c-Fos induction 
         To test whether mice with drug-induced stereotypies fail to respond to salient sensory cues, we measured the response of single-housed, amphetamine-treated male mice to the introduction of bedding from female cages to their own cage. To induce stereotypy, mice were treated for 7 days with high-dose D-amphetamine (7.0 mg/kg/day, i.p.), followed by 7 days of no-treatment and then a challenge dose (7.0 mg/kg, i.p.), as previously described (Figure  1A ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). Control mice were treated in parallel with vehicle (saline) injections only. On the challenge day, at 30 min after injection, we introduced a ball of used bedding taken from multiple cages of females. We scored the times the mice spent sniffing the bedding, locomoting or engaging in confined stereotypic behaviors based on a video taken 5 min after the introduction of the female bedding. Control mice spent between 30 and 50% of the time sniffing the female bedding (Figure  1B ). We compared this level to the times that they interacted with bedding that had been taken from their own home cage and found that they spent significantly more time interacting with the female cage bedding (Figure  1B ), supporting the interpretation that female cage bedding is a salient cue. By contrast, mice that were treated with repeated amphetamine spent most of their time engaging in stereotypic behaviors, sometimes interrupted by running bouts, and did not interact with the female cage bedding at all (Figure  1B ).

(B)  Analysis of behavior in saline-treated ( n  = 8) or D-amphetamine-treated mice ( n  = 8), for a 2 min videotaped interval at 30 min after injection, and 5 min after the introduction of bedding from female cages, or from their own home cage (for saline-treated only). The saline-treated mice interacted more with the female cage bedding than with bedding that was re-introduced from their own home cage ( *  p  = 1.2 × 10 −3 , paired  t -test). D-amphetamine-treated mice did not spend any time sniffing the female bedding ( **  p  = 8.1 × 10 −11 , unpaired  t -test, relative to saline-treated mice with female bedding). Error bars show standard deviations. 
           
           
         
         To test whether the mice exhibiting drug-induced stereotypy had imbalanced striosome-to-matrix ratios of immediate-early gene activation, as occurs in rats and monkeys (Canales and Graybiel,  2000 ; Saka et al.,  2004 ; Horner et al.,  2012 ; Jedynak et al.,  2012 ), we imaged c-Fos expression in striatal sections taken from D-amphetamine-treated mice ( n  = 4) compared to saline-treated mice ( n  = 4). To detect the striosome and matrix compartments, we used BAC transgenic mice (Gong et al.,  2007 ) with an enhanced GFP reporter for the matrix-enriched signaling molecule, CalDAG-GEFI (Kawasaki et al.,  1998 ; Crittenden et al.,  2016 ). The compartmental selectivity of CalDAG-GEFI-GFP expression followed gradients across the striatum, with the compartmental borders being easiest to identify in the central and lateral parts of the caudoputamen (Figures  2A–C ). CalDAG-GEFI-GFP mice were treated with D-amphetamine or saline, according to the schedule shown in Figure  1A , and brain tissue was taken for analysis 90 min after the challenge injection. Mice that received amphetamine injections, but none of the saline-treated mice, were engaged in stereotypic behaviors at the time of euthanasia. Saline-treated control mice showed low levels of c-Fos expression in cell nuclei distributed across both compartments in the striatum (Figures  2D–F ). By contrast, the striatum of the D-amphetamine-treated mice showed strong expression of c-Fos in the striosomes, with a lower density of c-Fos-positive nuclei in the surrounding matrix compartment (Figures  2G–I ).

         Cholinergic interneurons of the striatum project their axons into both striosome and matrix compartments of both control and drug-treated mice 
         To allow simultaneous detection of striatal ChIs and striosome-matrix compartments, we crossed the CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC mice to ChAT-Cre knock-in mice (Table  1 ). In the ChAT-Cre knock-in mice, Cre recombinase is fused to the end of the choline acetyltransferase gene at its endogenous locus (Rossi et al.,  2011 ) so as not to evoke over-expression of the nearby VAChT gene, as has been reported to occur in ChAT BAC transgenic mice (Kolisnyk et al.,  2013 ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). We labeled ChIs in the double transgenic mice by intrastriatal injections of an AAV5 virus encoding a Cre-dependent transgene for the mCherry fluorophore fused to channelrhodopsin [Ef1αDIOhChR2(H134R)-mCherry] (Mattis et al.,  2012 ). The infected mCherry-positive cells (Figures  3A–F ) resembled ChIs in that they were large and appeared scattered across the striatum, contained substantial extra-nuclear cytoplasm in the soma, and had multiple spots in the nucleus that stained for the chromatin-marker DAPI (Matamales et al.,  2009 ). We confirmed that these mCherry-positive neurons expressed the endogenous cholinergic cell marker VAChT in their cell bodies (in cyan in Figures  3G,H ). Very fine ChI fibers, presumably axons, were present in both the striosomes and matrix (Figure  3F ). Thicker, presumably dendritic, processes were concentrated in the matrix, with some running along compartment borders and occasionally crossing the borders (Figure  3F ).

         To be sure that the ChI innervation of both striosomes and matrix was maintained after repeated D-amphetamine treatment, we injected the double transgenic mice intrastriatally with the AAV5-ChR2-mCherry, waited for 2 weeks, and then treated the mice with D-amphetamine according to the standard schedule (Figure  1A ) prior to collection of brain tissue on the challenge day. As in control mice, cholinergic neurons were evident along with dense neuropil from infected ChIs (Figures  3I–M ). 
         Cholinergic neuropil, though present in both compartments, was not homogenously distributed across the striatum, in accord with previous findings (Graybiel et al.,  1986 ). The cholinergic neuropil distribution was most clearly evident in mice with global labeling for cholinergic cell reporters (double transgenic knock-in ChAT-Cre;Ai32-EYFP mice and single BAC transgenic ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice, (Table  1 ; Figure  4 ). Striosomes, especially in the medial striatum, were often visible as darker regions with reduced densities of large cholinergic processes, both in the ChAT-Cre mice with intrastriatal viral injections and in the ChAT-Cre;Ai32-EYFP knock-in and ChAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC mice.

         Cholinergic interneuron activation induces a pause or a spike advance to disrupt SPN firing patterns 
         We made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GFP-positive striatal neurons in the matrix and from GFP-negative striatal neurons within striosomes of CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC mice (Figures  5A–F ). With the goal of testing for cholinergic modulation of excitatory inputs to SPNs, we measured the amount of current injection required to induce repetitive spiking activity (rheobase) in striosomal and matrix SPNs. SPNs typically fired regularly at current injection levels above rheobase, and striosomal neurons were more excitable than matrix neurons in the striatal slices taken from mature mice ( n  = 33 striosomal SPNs,  n  = 32 matrix SPNs, from 16 mice; Figures  5G–I ), as previously reported for slices taken from young mice and rats (Kawaguchi et al.,  1989 ; Miura et al.,  2007 ; Smith et al.,  2016 ).

         As a direct test of whether the striatal ChIs can modulate activity in striosomal and matrix SPNs, we then made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in coronal slices through the striatum of double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice in which intrastriatal injections of AAV5-ChR2-mCherry had been made (Figures  3A–F ,  6A ). At 2 weeks after intrastriatal virus injection, the double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice began daily saline injections in order that they could serve as controls for comparison to sibling mice treated with D-amphetamine (Figure  1A ). After the final injection, we prepared brain slices and applied wide-field, 10 ms blue light pulses to the striatal slices (Figure  6A ). This treatment reliably generated an action potential in ChIs of both saline-treated and amphetamine-treated mice (Figure  7A ). To test how ChI activation modulated SPN activity, we induced epochs of regular SPN spiking activity by 800 ms current injection sweeps. We then compared SPN responses to current injection alone to the responses elicited 30 s later by the same current injection combined with a 10 ms light pulse beginning at 500 ms after the start of current injection (Figure  6B ). Most neurons in the control group exhibited a pause or marked reduction in spiking following the light pulse, and some also showed a single spike at short latency after light application, typically followed by a pause (Figures  6B,C ;  n  = 5 ChAT-Cre knock-in mice with viral expression of ChR2, 35 striatal neurons, 12 from striosomes, 10 from matrix, and 13 from mice with no matrix-GFP label). These effects were found in both single transgenic ChAT-Cre knock-in mice and double transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC;ChAT-Cre knock-in mice (Figure  6C ). To insure that the responses were not artifacts of light application, we measured the SPN responses in single transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP BAC mice with no ChR2 expression. In these control mice, the light application did not disrupt firing at all (data not shown).

Gray shading denotes the “baseline” period (270–800 ms after the start of the first current injection) and the “pre-light” period (from 270 ms after the start of the second current injection until light onset). Yellow shading denotes the “response” period (from 40 to 150 ms after light onset).

         Responses of a given SPN to the ChI activation were generally consistent across different trials at different current intensities, as shown in Figures  8A–C . SPNs typically exhibited one of three response types: advanced spike followed by a pause, pause only (without advanced spike), and non-responsive. The pause response was observed more frequently than the advanced spike response, but there was one exceptional neuron that responded to the light with advanced spikes but no pause (Table  2 ). In neurons with advanced spikes, the extra spikes were limited to a time window of about 40 or 50 ms after light onset (Figure  8D ). To quantify these differences, we developed a statistical analysis to detect both increases and decreases in firing rate on a trial-by-trial basis. For each trial, ISIs were calculated for spikes in three time windows (Figure  6C ): the first current injection (“baseline”), the portion of the second current injection preceding the light (“pre-light”), and the remainder of the second current injection (“post-light”). We then used Grubbs' test (see Materials and Methods) for outliers to determine whether the shortest and/or the longest post-light ISIs could be considered outliers in the context of the pre-light baseline ISIs. By this method, we found that both the pause and the advanced spike responses (Table  2 ) were statistically significant.

         Striosomal SPNs can be more responsive to ChI modulation than matrix SPNs 
         To calculate the statistical significance of the striosomal and matrix SPN responses to light, we compared the total numbers of spikes in the response period from 40 to 150 ms after light onset to the numbers of spikes in the baseline and pre-light time windows (Figure  6C ). We added the spike counts in the baseline and pre-light windows, and then performed a chi-squared test with Yates' correction comparing the actual spike counts in the response window and combined pre-light baseline window with the values expected under the null hypothesis that the light had no effect. The entire procedure was repeated separately for identified striosomal SPNs and identified matrix SPNs (Table  3 ). Striosomal SPNs as a group showed a significant effect of the light at a substantially lower  p  level than did the matrix group ( p  = 1.2 × 10 −7  vs.  p  = 0.009). To verify that this difference reflected a stronger response to the light in striosomal SPNs, we performed a chi-squared test for dependence between the effects of neuron type (striosomal vs. matrix) and time window (pre-light baseline vs. response). The null hypothesis of no difference between striosomal and matrix SPNs was rejected with a significance level of  p  = 0.016 for the slice recordings from saline-treated mice. When aggregating spike counts across different neurons, the results will be dominated by the highest firing neurons. There were 3 out of 22 compartment-identified SPNs in the saline-treated group and 1 out of 14 compartment-identified SPNs in the amphetamine-treated group that had spike counts during the combined pre-light baseline window that were more than 1.5 times the aggregated median value. We repeated the statistical analysis after excluding these neurons (Table  4 ) and found with a chi-squared test that the group of striosomal SPNs still showed a trend to be more significantly affected than the matrix SPNs, but now with a non-significant  p  = 0.14. Just as before the exclusion of the more highly firing neurons, both the striosomal and matrix SPNs were found to be responsive to ChI-mediated modulation ( p  = 9 × 10 −5  for striosomal vs.  p  = 0.024 for matrix SPNs).

         Firing activity of striosomal and matrix SPNs is resistant to ChI-mediated disruption in mice with drug-induced stereotypy 
         To test whether SPNs from mice in a state of severe repetitive behavior exhibit abnormalities in the ChI-to-SPN signaling microcircuit, we recorded in slices taken from mice engaged in amphetamine-induced stereotypy ( n  = 4 ChAT-Cre knock-in mice with viral expression of ChR2, 24 striatal neurons, 7 from striosomes, 7 from matrix, and 10 from mice with no matrix-GFP label). On the amphetamine challenge day, we isolated brain tissue at the 30 min time-point after D-amphetamine injection and prepared striatal sections for whole-cell recording (Figure  1A ). The drug-treated mice were confirmed to be in a state of stereotypy at the time of tissue collection. ChIs in the dorsal striatum of slices from the drug-treated mice responded reliably to light stimulation (Figure  7B ) except in one mouse; data from this mouse were not included in the analyses. We did not analyze baseline activity of ChI activity in control or drug-treated mice but, rather, tested whether SPNs responded differently to the single spike induced by optogenetic stimulation of the ChIs. 
         The raster plots and spike density plots of the striosomal and matrix SPN responses to ChI stimulation showed a severely blunted SPN response in the slices from D-amphetamine-treated mice (Figure  6D ). We evaluated the significance of the responses by performing chi-squared tests with Yates' correction to compare the spike counts in the post-light time-window and the baseline plus pre-light spike counts with the values expected under the null hypothesis that the light had no effect. These tests showed that neither striosomal nor matrix SPN firing frequencies showed a significant response to the light ( p  = 0.4 for striosomal SPNs and  p  = 0.4 for matrix SPNs). We performed a chi-squared test for dependence between the effects of neuron type (striosomal vs. matrix) and time window (pre-light baseline vs. response) and found that no difference was apparent ( p  = 0.9). Although there were some neurons that showed a response to the light after D-amphetamine treatment (Table  5 ; Figure  8E ), the proportion of SPNs that responded was much lower in the drug-treated group (Figure  8F ) than in the saline-treated group (22% vs. 74% respectively), and this difference was significant by Fisher's exact test ( p  = 1.3 × 10 −4 ).

         To confirm that our results were not unique to virally mediated expression of ChR2, we also made recordings in double BAC transgenic CalDAG-GEFI-GFP;ChAT-ChR2-EYFP mice that had global cholinergic expression of a ChR2 transgene ( n  = 5 mice) and that were treated with either repeated saline or repeated D-amphetamine (Figure  1A ). For these tests, we administered blue light with a manually controlled shutter, thus inducing multiple spikes in the ChIs of saline-treated and D-amphetamine-treated mice (Figures  9A,B ). We recorded from 7 SPNs that were CalDAG-GEFI-GFP-positive (matrix) and 7 SPNs that were in CalDAG-GEFI-GFP-negative zones (striosomes). In the saline-treated preparations, we observed that the spiking pattern of both striosomal and matrix SPNs could be disrupted by a pause or by a spike advance (Figures  9C–F ), as we had found for the SPN responses in ChAT-Cre knock-in mice with virally expressed ChR2. However, in slices taken from the amphetamine-treated mice expressing severe D-amphetamine-induced stereotypy ( n  = 5 mice, 29 striatal SPNs, 13 from striosomes, 16 from matrix), the striosomal and matrix SPNs no longer responded to light (Figures  9G,H ). Thus, ChI activation normally produced a pause or spike-advance in the regular firing pattern of striosomal and matrix SPNs in brain slices from two different lines of transgenic mice but these effects were blocked in slices taken from amphetamine-treated mice exhibiting drug-induced stereotypic behavior.

         D-amphetamine treatment did not induce a chronic, baseline failure in the ability of ChIs to disrupt SPN firing patterns 
         Repeated methamphetamine treatments can produce prolonged changes in baseline striatal acetylcholine signaling (Bamford et al.,  2008 ). To test whether the ChI to SPN signaling phenotype that we observed in drug-treated mice was due to a baseline change in SPN responsivity, we treated mice with the same 7-day drug treatment schedule but challenged them with saline, not amphetamine, prior to recording ( n  = 2 mice, 10 striatal neurons, 3 from striosomes, 3 from matrix, and 4 from mice with no matrix-GFP label). As before, we harvested brain slices at 30 min after the challenge, and we confirmed, in every slice, that ChIs responded to the 10 ms light pulse with a spike. Optogenetic stimulation of ChIs in striatal slices taken from these mice appeared to disrupt SPN spike-timing just as in mice that had never been exposed to drug (Figure  10 ). A chi-squared test comparing spike density in the baseline and pre-light periods to the period after light application (periods highlighted in Figure  10 ) showed that there was a significant effect in each mouse that was tested ( p  = 0.0013 and  p  = 4.2 × 10 −5 ), and when the results from both mice were combined, the value was  p  = 4.6 × 10 −7 .

         The disruption of striosomal and matrix SPN firing pattern by ChI activation is dependent on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors 
         ChI signaling can drive disynaptic inhibition in SPNs by activating nicotinic receptors on nearby terminals (Miura et al.,  2006 ; English et al.,  2012 ; Tritsch et al.,  2012 ; Luo et al.,  2013 ; Nelson et al.,  2014b ; Faust et al.,  2015 ). We tested whether bath application of the α4β2 nicotinic receptor antagonist, DHβE, would block the response to ChI stimulation that we found in striosomal and matrix SPNs. We recorded from 4 SPNs in the CalDAG-GEFI-GFP-negative (striosomes) and 2 CalDAG-GEFI-GFP-positive (matrix) SPNs, all of which responded with a pause or a spike-advance to the optogenetic stimulation of ChIs (examples shown in Figures  11A,B , left panels). After bath application of DHβE, these same 6 SPNs no longer responded to the light (Figures  11A,B , right panels). Similarly, in ChAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC mice, bath-applied DHβE blocked the light-induced responses of 8/10 SPNs (Figure  11C ).

       Discussion 
       
         ChIs send abundant axonal projections into striosomes and matrix circuits implicated in selecting behavioral responses to salient cues 
         Stereotypy can be viewed as an extreme loss of behavioral flexibility (Graybiel,  2008 ) and loss of responsiveness to salient cues, a feature recognized in individuals with disorders on the autism spectrum (Gotham et al.,  2007 ). Presentation of an instructive cue induces a semi-synchronized response in striatal ChIs consisting of a brief activation followed by a pause in spiking and then a rebound activation before a return to unsynchronized, tonic firing (Aosaki et al.,  1994b ; Minamimoto and Kimura,  2002 ; Goldberg and Reynolds,  2011 ; Doig et al.,  2014 ; Thorn and Graybiel,  2014 ). A leading hypothesis is that this ChI response is important for an animal's ability to adapt its behavior in accordance with predicted outcomes (Minamimoto et al.,  2005 ; McCool et al.,  2008 ; Brown et al.,  2010 ; Ding et al.,  2010 ; Goldberg and Reynolds,  2011 ; Okada et al.,  2014 ). The response of ChIs to cue presentation is dependent upon inputs from the sensory thalamus, the dopaminergic system and the cerebral cortex (Aosaki et al.,  1994a ; Goldberg and Reynolds,  2011 ; Doig et al.,  2014 ). Inputs from sensory thalamus to ChI dendrites are matrix-preferring (Fujiyama et al.,  2006 ; Raju et al.,  2006 ). Consistently, we observed that ChI dendrites appeared slightly more prominent in the matrix compartment, relative to the high abundance of ChI axons in both striosomes and matrix. Thus, ChI dendrites, as well as labeling of matrix-preferring inputs from brainstem cholinergic projections (Dautan et al.,  2014 ), likely account for the overall matrix-enriched expression of transgene reporters, immunomarkers and chemical markers for cholinergic processes (Graybiel et al.,  1986 ; Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). 
         Psychomotor stimulants are well known to induce stereotypic behaviors, and in accordance with this linkage, we found that after repeated high-dose D-amphetamine treatment, male mice were engaged in stereotypy and failed to respond when we introduced the normally salient stimulus of bedding taken from female cages. Multiple brain regions and signaling mechanisms are implicated in evoking stereotypic behaviors of different sorts (Berridge,  2006 ; Mason and Rushen,  2008 ). In the dorsal striatum, dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling modulate drug-induced stereotypic behaviors (Capper-Loup et al.,  2002 ; Aliane et al.,  2011 ; Crittenden and Graybiel,  2016 ). Both increases and decreases in acetylcholine signaling have been implicated in the induction of stereotypic behavior, highlighting how a  balance  of neurotransmitter effects may be what is key to preventing this pathological behavior. For example, the ablation or inhibition of ChI signaling in the striosome-rich anteromedial dorsal striatum prolongs cocaine-induced stereotypy in rats (Aliane et al.,  2011 ), but as well, mice with abnormally high levels of VAChT, thought to augment acetylcholine release, exhibit increased amphetamine-induced stereotypy (Crittenden et al.,  2014 ). Stimulation of the ionotropic nicotinic receptors increases motoric responses to cocaine and amphetamine (Schoffelmeer et al.,  2002 ; Collins and Izenwasser,  2004 ), whereas antagonism of the slower metabotropic muscarinic signaling system generally increases cocaine-induced responses, including stereotypy (Thomsen et al.,  2010 ; Aliane et al.,  2011 ). Thus, the relationship between cholinergic signaling and stereotypy is complex, with contradictory observations being reported. Some ideas that may help reconcile them are (1) muscarinic and nicotinic transmission may in general have opposite effects, (2) disrupting cholinergic transmission in different districts of the striatum has different effects, and so (3) stereotypies may be controlled both by stimulation and by inhibition of cholinergic transmission, depending on exactly where and how the stimulation or inhibition is accomplished. How this relates to the role of acetylcholine in cue-detection remains unknown. 
       
       
         Drugs of abuse and imbalanced striosome vs. matrix gene activation 
         With repeated administration of psychomotor stimulants, overall gene induction in the matrix of the dorsal striatum is suppressed relative to control treatments (Steiner and Gerfen,  1995 ; Nguyen et al.,  2009 ), and the striosome-to-matrix ratio of c-Fos immediate-early gene induction is increased (Graybiel et al.,  1990 ; Canales and Graybiel,  2000 ; Vanderschuren et al.,  2002 ; Saka et al.,  2004 ; Jedynak et al.,  2012 ). By contrast, rats engaged in normal behaviors in their home cage are reported to have similar levels of metabolic activity in the two compartments (Brown et al.,  2002 ). Experiments aimed at directly ablating striosomes in rats by intrastriatal injection of MOR1-binding toxins (Tokuno et al.,  2002 ; Lawhorn et al.,  2009 ) have been reported to result in reduced stereotypic responses to methamphetamine and increased c-Fos induction in the matrix (Murray et al.,  2014 ). Our experimental mice showed the expected imbalance in striosome-to-matrix c-Fos induction after a challenge injection of D-amphetamine, with strong nuclear c-Fos immunoreactivity in neurons of GFP-negative striosomes and low levels of c-Fos in neurons of the surrounding matrix. The saline-treated mice showed low-level c-Fos immunostaining that was similar across the compartments. The predominant striosomal activity in drug-treated animals, as measured by the proxy of c-Fos induction, could serve to minimize excess dopamine release driven by drugs of abuse. This speculation would fit with a bare-bones circuit model whereby relative activation of striosomal SPNs directly inhibits dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and relative silencing of matrix SPNs disinhibits substantia nigra reticulata neurons that thereby are released to inhibit the dopamine-containing neurons. 
       
       
         ChI modulation of SPN spike firing patterns in striosomal and matrix SPNs 
         The electrophysiological response of SPNs to direct ChI stimulation has been previously described without classification of striosomal or matrix cell type and thus should favor those in the matrix, which makes up most of the total volume of the striatum. Analyses of SPN responses to ChI stimulation have shown that there are multiple inhibitory post-synaptic currents with fast, slow and very slow time-courses (English et al.,  2012 ), and small excitatory post-synaptic currents (Higley et al.,  2011 ). The inhibitory effects can be transmitted from ChIs to SPNs disynaptically, via nicotinic receptor-mediated release of GABA from neurogliaform and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive striatal interneurons (English et al.,  2012 ; Luo et al.,  2013 ; Faust et al.,  2016 ), from other SPNs (Miura et al.,  2006 ), or from dopamine-containing afferents (Tritsch et al.,  2012 ; Nelson et al.,  2014b ). Acetylcholine can also inhibit SPNs via muscarinic receptors on SPNs (Clements et al.,  2013 ) and via muscarinic receptor-mediated suppression of glutamate release from cortical terminals (Ding et al.,  2010 ). The effects of ChI activation on striatal microcircuits can be particularly powerful, at least as measured in slice preparations, in that single spikes of ChIs can promote nicotinic receptor-mediated release of GABA and recurrent inhibition (Sullivan et al.,  2008 ; Inoue et al.,  2016 ). The findings raise the possibility that the prominent pause in tonic ChI activity might in fact be preceded by a single, instructive ChI action potential. We found that optogenetic induction of a single spike in ChIs in striatal slices could induce both a brief pause of evoked firing activity and a spike advance in striatal SPNs. Prolonged ChI stimulation appeared to have the same brief consequence on SPN firing patterns. 
         Relative to SPNs in the matrix, we found that striosomal SPNs showed a greater response to ChI stimulation. Considering the diversity of SPN cell types (Gokce et al.,  2016 ), a larger sample of neurons would make this conclusion firmer. We found that the SPN responses to ChI activation were blocked by bath application of the β2 nicotinic receptor antagonist, DhβE, consistent with a disynaptic inhibition microcircuit, such as that relayed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on GABAergic terminals. All together, these results suggest that there may be greater nicotinic receptor-dependent transmission from GABAergic terminals onto at least some striosomal SPNs than onto matrix SPNs. We and others previously found that subsets of nigral neurons (Gerfen et al.,  1987 ; Jimenez-Castellanos and Graybiel,  1987 ; Prensa and Parent,  2001 ; Crittenden et al.,  2016 ), which from their positions are likely overlapping with those that synthesize GABA (Kim et al.,  2015 ), appeared to project more abundantly to striosomes than to the matrix. Thus, striosome-enriched terminals from GABAergic dopamine-containing neurons are one potential source of the increased ChI-mediated inhibition of striosomal neurons. 
         Friedman and colleagues found that relatively selective activation of striosomal SPNs, induced by optogenetic manipulation of prelimbic cortex input fibers, biased rats' cost-benefit trade-off decisions in a T-maze task, so that rats were biased to choose the high-cost/high-value arm over the low-cost/low-value arm (Friedman et al.,  2015 ). This effect appeared to be mediated by a microcircuit in which the activity of high-firing inhibitory interneurons of the striatum was normally enhanced by prelimbic cortical inputs during the trade-off task, leading to suppression of putative striosomal prelimbic-recipient SPNs, but not of non-prelimbic-recipient SPNs of the extrastriosomal matrix. Our results here suggest that other microcircuits, involving ChIs, could be important for the relative inhibition, or disruption of spike timing, in striosomes. It is clearly of great interest that these two classes of striatal interneurons both appear to affect SPN spike timing, a fundamental characteristic of circuit organization and plasticity. 
         In some instances, and in both compartments, we observed an SPN spike that occurred within 40–50 ms of the light application, and sometimes much sooner, raising the possibility of monosynaptic transmission from ChIs to SPNs. Considering that evidence is sparse for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated currents in SPNs (Luo et al.,  2013 ), these responses could more likely be mediated by glutamate. VGluT3 glutamate transporters are enriched in subsets of ChIs (Gras et al.,  2008 ; Stensrud et al.,  2013 ), and glutamate released from ChIs in the dorsal striatum can induce fast excitatory post-synaptic responses in striatal interneurons (Luo et al.,  2013 ; Nelson et al.,  2014a ) and in SPNs (Higley et al.,  2011 ). 
       
       
         Cholinergic signaling in the striosome and matrix compartments is disrupted in slices taken from mice engaged in drug-induced stereotypy 
         Normally, electrically evoked dopamine release is slightly higher in the matrix than in striosomes (Brimblecombe and Cragg,  2015 ; Salinas et al.,  2016 ), but in mice in which striosomal neurons are identifiable by Nr4a1-GFP, the ratio is reversed by acute application of cocaine to the brain slices (Salinas et al.,  2016 ). These findings in striatal slices suggest that cocaine disrupts local circuits that maintain the baseline striosome-to-matrix ratio of dopamine signaling. In brain slices from drug-naive rats and mice, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor agonists have differential effects on evoked dopamine release in the striosomes and matrix, and these agonist effects are partially affected by cholinergic blockade (Tremblay et al.,  1992 ; Brimblecombe and Cragg,  2015 ). Part of the effect might also be mediated by somatostatin-containing interneurons (Brimblecombe and Cragg,  2015 ), which tend to lie near striosomal borders. The possibility that striatal interneurons might mediate direct striosome-matrix communication is further supported by the finding that striatal injection of an NK1 receptor-coupled toxin ablates ChIs and somatostatin-positive interneurons and causes a disruption to the pattern of heightened c-Fos induction in striosomes induced by dopamine agonists (Saka et al.,  2004 ). We have found that ChIs do indeed modulate spike-timing of striosomal and matrix neurons in drug-naive mice and that this modulation is severely blunted in slices taken from mice treated with a schedule of D-amphetamine that induces an imbalance in the striosome-to-matrix ratio of c-Fos expression. 
         Repeated exposure to psychomotor stimulants strongly impacts ChI signaling in the dorsal striatum (Wang et al.,  2013 ), including partial inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated dopamine release as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in slices (Acevedo-Rodriguez et al.,  2014 ). This effect may be a compensatory response to over-stimulation of the dopamine system, considering that ChIs drive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated dopamine release (Zhou et al.,  2001 ; Cachope et al.,  2012 ; Threlfell et al.,  2012 ). Consistently, DHβE application reduces electrically evoked dopamine release in both striosome and matrix compartments (Salinas et al.,  2016 ). We confirmed that optogenetic stimulation induced a spike in ChIs in slices from drug-treated mice, but we did not examine whether baseline ChI firing rates or acetylcholine release were impaired. Thus, whether the ChI-to-SPN signaling defects are pre- or post-synaptic, or both, remains to be tested. Regardless of the mechanism, if semi-synchronized signaling from ChIs to SPNs is important for responsiveness to salient cues, one consequence of drug-repressed cholinergic signaling could be a loss of normal engagement with the environment. When the ChI signaling across striosome and matrix compartments breaks down under drug intoxication, behavioral flexibility and cue responsiveness could be lost.

         Plant genetic transformation has arguably been the core of plant improvement in recent decades. Efforts have been made to develop in planta transformation systems due to the limitations present in the tissue-culture-based methods. Herein, we report an improved in planta transformation system, and provide the evidence of reporter gene expression in pollen tube, embryos and stable transgenicity of the plants following pollen-mediated plant transformation with optimized sonication treatment of pollen. The results showed that the aeration at 4°C treatment of pollen grains in sucrose prior to sonication significantly improved the pollen viability leading to improved kernel set and transformation efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy observation revealed that the removal of operculum covering pollen pore by ultrasonication might be one of the reasons for the pollen grains to become competent for transformation. Evidences have shown that the  eGfp  gene was expressed in the pollen tube and embryos, and the  Cry1Ac  gene was detected in the subsequent T 1  and T 2  progenies, suggesting the successful transfer of the foreign genes to the recipient plants. The Southern blot analysis of  Cry1Ac  gene in T 2  progenies and PCR-identified  Apr  gene segregation in T 2  seedlings confirmed the stable inheritance of the transgene. The outcome illustrated that the pollen-mediated genetic transformation system can be widely applied in the plant improvement programs with apparent advantages over tissue-culture-based transformation methods.

       Introduction 
       Genetic transformation has become an important tool in the improvement of plants. Numerous genetic transformation methods have been developed in the past three decades for a wide range of plant species. Generally, they have been classified into indirect or direct transformation ( Rao et al., 2009 ). Biological methods using bacteria or viruses are referred to as indirect, while direct methods are basically in physical ways, that is, by the penetration of the cell wall ( Torney et al., 2007 ;  Rivera et al., 2012 ;  Ziemienowicz et al., 2012 ). At present, two transformation methods are most commonly used in plants, i.e.,  Agrobacterium -mediated transformation and particle bombardment. Although widely used in the research community, these methods have a common disadvantage, i.e., the requirement of a long and laborious plant tissue culture process, which is highly genotype-dependent and costly ( Birch, 1997 ;  Ioannidis et al., 2016 ). As some plant species or varieties are difficult to regenerate through tissue culture, the applications of these methods have been restricted to some extent. Furthermore, the occurrence of somatic variation and low survival rate of some regenerated plantlets during transplanting process make the already low transformation efficiency further compromised. Despite of some reports on transformation approaches independent of tissue culture, these methods have not been applied efficiently in practice due to the complexity to operate and low efficiency. Therefore, transformation methods without tissue culture procedure and simple to operate are needed. 
       The interest in developing non-tissue culture based or  in planta  transformation methods has been growing ( Shou et al., 2002 ). The production of transgenic plants in such way could in general be relatively simple, inexpensive and efficient. Although being independent of tissue culture and having been used for many years, floral dipping method is confined to only a few species that also restricted its wider application in many other plant species ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). It has been considered, therefore, that the reproductive system of plants is a potential pathway for the introduction of foreign genes ( Luo and Wu, 1989 ). 
       Attempts have been made to develop non-tissue culture based transformation in plants in the last three decades ( Ohta, 1986 ;  Booy et al., 1989 ;  Li et al., 2004 ). Pollen tube pathway-mediated genetic transfer was reported in genetic transformation in cotton ( Zhou et al., 1983 ) and rice ( Luo and Wu, 1989 ). This method was once regarded advantageous due to its independency of tissue culture and plant regeneration, no requirement on well-equipped labs, and its simplicity to operate. However, the transformation efficiency of this method has been proven low and thus requires massive transformant selection efforts among a large number of progenies, and the method was not reproducible at least in some cases ( Shou et al., 2002 ). Furthermore,  Booy et al. (1989)  demonstrated that the digestion of plasmid DNA by nuclease was a major obstacle for using pollen grains as vector for genetic transformation. 
       It has been suggested that the ultrasonication treatment of pollen grains denatures the nuclease while not completely inhibiting their viability and germination, and a genetic transformation approach using plant pollen as a vector was reported ( Wang et al., 2001 ). In the method, pollen grains are targeted as a vector to carry foreign genes with the assistance of sonication treatments in a sucrose solution. Genes of interest were then incorporated to the progenies by pollination process with the treated pollen and subsequent selection of genetically transformed seedlings. Pollen-mediated transformation is a quick and easy alternative method to generate transgenic plants, bypassing the requisite for tissue culture. It has a potential to produce genetically modified plants within a short period, leading to inclusion of the method in conventional crop breeding programs. The method has also been proven applicable in sorghum ( Wang et al., 2007 ) and  Brassica  ( Wang et al., 2008 ). Nevertheless, a major shortcoming of the then reported method showed low kernel setting rate after pollination, because most pollen grains lose their viability after ultrasonication and fail to complete the fertilization process. Further, evidences of transformation in the following procedures, for example, during pollen germination, and embryo development were lacking to support the success of transformation was due to the transformation of pollen grains. Therefore, improved kernel setting rate and further evidences to demonstrate the transformation of pollen grains as vectors have become desirable for wider application of such method. We hypothesize that low temperature and aeration may be beneficial for maintaining pollen viability during sonication process as pollen is active in metabolisms which requires large amount of oxygen and temperature may rise. Therefore, we tested the effects of aeration and low temperature treatment to the sucrose solution prior to transformation of pollen grains. Further, we also hypothesize that foreign gene (s) transformed to generative cell/sperms will be incorporated to zygote through fertilization of egg by the sperm with transgene and then passed on to the progeny. Herein, we report an optimized pollen-mediated plant transformation method that demonstrated effectiveness of the transformation of foreign genes by their expression at various stages. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Plant Materials 
         Maize inbred Zheng58 and Dika527 obtained from Qiangsheng Seed Ltd. Shanxi, China, were used throughout the study. The plants were grown at an isolated experimental plot in the Experimental Research Station of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Taiyuan, China (N37°46′, E112°34′), and tassels of recipient maize plants were removed before anthesis to keep a pollen-free condition. Pollen donor maize plants were grown in another experimental plot which was more than 500 m apart from the recipient. The seeds were sown in early May and corn ears were harvested in early October each year with sufficient irrigation when needed. The field management was carried out according to the guideline provided for the breed. 
       
       
         Transformation Vectors 
         Two constructs, plasmid p3301UbiAc harboring a bar gene as a selector and a gene  Cry1Ac  kindly provided by  Lian et al. (2008) , and plasmid pLM01 harboring an ampicillin resistant gene ( Apr ) as a selector and an  eGfp  gene gifted by  Moeller et al. (2009)  ( Figure  1  ), were used in the present study. Plasmid DNA was extracted with alkaline lysis according to  Sambrook et al. (1989) .

         Pollen Grain Treatment 
         
           The Pollen Collection 
           In order to be able to harvest desirable quality of fresh pollen, old anthers were removed and the tassels were bagged in the afternoon the day prior to the collection. On the collection day, fresh pollen grains were collected into a paper bag between 10:00–13:00 by shaking the tassels. The collection was sieved to remove anthers, and the pollen grains were used immediately for the downstream treatments or preserved in Petri dishes placed in a hydro-prevent chamber at 4°C until required. 
         
         
           Aeration and Temperature Treatment Optimize for Pollen Grains 
           A 2 × 2 factorial design was performed to test the effect of aeration and temperature treatments on pollen viability and germination capability. The factors were: aeration treatment, 0 min or 20 min and temperature, 4°C or 25°C. Here, the group with 0 min aeration and temperature at 25°C was regarded as an experimental control. A total of 0.3 g sieved pollen was suspended in 20 ml of 15% sterilized sucrose solution in a beaker. The suspension was aerated by an air pump ( Figure  2  ) for desired time at desired temperature as indicated previously as the treatments. Approximately 500 μl of the pollen suspension or equivalent to 3.0 × 10 4  pollen grains (247 × 10 -9  g / maize pollen grain;  Miller, 1982 ) was allocated to a small Petri dish (3 cm in diameter) to examine the germination rates by incubation for 2 h at 25°C. Pollen intactness and pollen tube growth were observed with an optical microscope (IX51, Olympus, Osaka, Japan). Eight replications were taken with 60 pollen grains for each image.

Sieved pollen was suspended in 15% sterilized sucrose solution in a beaker and the suspension was aerated by an air pump for 20 min prior to ultrasonication treatment. 
             
             
           
         
         
           Sonication Treatment 
           The best combination of aeration time and temperature showing optimal pollen intactness, germination rate, and pollen tube growth was applied to pollen suspension before a sonication pre-treatment, then the pollen grains were treated with an ultrasonic homogenizer (Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China, JY92-llN; Frequency: 20–25 Hz) by submerging the probe of the homogenizer into the pollen suspension. The power of the ultrasonic homogenizer was set to 150 W and the sonication lasted for 10 s each time with an interval of 10 s for a total of six times. 
           Ten microgram of plasmid DNA (approximately 1: 30,000 W/W of DNA: pollen) was added to the treated pollen suspension and then sonicated again as described above. All the sonication procedures were performed on ice to protect DNA and pollen contents from being degraded or damaged. Untreated pollen mixed with plasmid DNA was used as control. 
         
       
       
         Pollination 
         The treated pollen suspension was incubated at room temperature for 10 min following the ultrasonication to let the pollen grains to sediment and the supernatant was then carefully discarded. The pollen mass obtained was gently brushed onto the silks of recipients. The pollinated ears were then bagged to protect stray pollen contamination. The mature ears were harvested and the seeds were collected and stored at room temperature until they were sown in the following year. Approximately one thousand maize ears were pollinated and harvested for each treatment, and seed setting were recorded for each ear. 
       
       
         Transformant Screening 
         In contrast to the transformation of somatic cells, we define the primary transgenic kernels as T 1  kernels and the seedlings from the kernels are T 1  plants. Harvested T 1  kernels were sown in the field as described. At 5–6 leaf stage, fresh leaves from T 1  seedlings were collected (for plants pollinated with pLM01 DNA) or sprayed with herbicide Basta (50 μl L -1 ) to select survived plants (for plants pollinated with plasmid p3301UbiAc DNA ), and total DNA was extracted with CTAB method for subsequent molecular analysis ( Doyle, 1991 ). 
       
       
         Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
         Pollen grains from sonication and control groups were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde solution (0.2M, pH7.1 phosphate buffer) and kept at 4°C until further processing. Pollen grains were dehydrated in gradient alcohol solutions at the concentrations of 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%, each for 10 min successively. The dehydrated samples were then dried at the ambient temperature overnight, and coated with gold using a JEOL JFC-1600 AUTO COATER. The morphology of the pollen grains was viewed and images taken under a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7500, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, JEOL, Ltd Tokyo Japan). 
       
       
         Fluorescence Microscopy and Imaging 
         Pollen, pollen tube, and embryo were observed and photographed under bright field with white light illumination using an Olympus Microscope (U-LH100HG, Olympus, Osaka, Japan).  EGfp  expression was observed under fluorescence microscope at 0.5 h interval with blue light (495 nm) as the exciting light. A drop of pollen suspension from various treatment groups was incubated at 25°C on the glass slide kept in a covered Petri dish containing wet filter paper. Pollen tubes were observed 2.5–3 h after sonication treatment. Embryos were excised with a scalpel harvested at 15 days after pollination and then observed and photographed under bright field and fluorescence microscope as described above. 
       
       
         Polymerase Chain Reaction 
         Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the presence of  Cry1Ac  or  Apr  gene fragment with primer pairs (Forward: 5′- CTG ACC GTG ACC GTG CTG -3′ Reverse 5′- TGG the TGC CGT AGG CGA ACT -3′, which was ∼500bp, or Forward: 5′- ATGAGTATTCAACATTTCCG -3′ Reverse 5′-TTTGGTATGGCTTCATTCAG -3′, which was ∼500 bp. The primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotechnology Company, Shanghai, China. PCR was performed in a volume of 25 μl consisting of 2.5 μl 10× reaction buffer, 200 mM dNTPs, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 ng of DNA, 0.5 μM of each primer, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), using a PTC-200 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA, USA). The PCR cycles were: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 45 s, 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel, visualized and photographed under ultraviolet light following ethidium bromide staining. 
       
       
         Southern Blot 
         Southern hybridization was performed with a  Cry1Ac  specific probe. Plasmid P3301UbiAc DNA was used as PCR template with the primers 5′- CTG ACC GTG ACC GTG CTG -3′(Forward) and 5′-TGG TGC CGT AGG CGA ACT -3′(Reverse), and the probe was labeled with digoxigenin which was ∼500 bp. Approximately 15 μg genomic DNA of the PCR-positive T 2  and control plants were purified as described and digested overnight, with  Hind  III endonucleases ( Hind  III cuts once in the plasmid). And the digested DNA was then separated on a 1% agarose gel followed by transferring the fragments to a nylon membrane. The membrane was subjected to hybridization over night with digoxigenin labeled probe that was then detected by the digoxigenin luminescence detection procedure according to the instruction of Roche DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Upper Bavaria, Germany). 
       
       
         Statistical Analysis 
         Pollen viability and kernel set data were analyzed using the statistical package IBM ®  SPSS ®  Statistics package, version 19 (IBM Corporation). The main effects of aeration and temperature, and their interactions were examined by analysis of variance using the general linear model.

         Effects of Aeration and Temperature on Pollen Viability and Kernel Set 
         Aeration of the sucrose solution significantly reduced the broken rate of pollen grains ( P  &lt; 0.001), improved pollen germination rate ( P  &lt; 0.01) and increased the pollen tube length ( P  &lt; 0.05) ( Table  1  ). Similar effects were also observed following lower temperature (4°C) treatment with significantly reduced pollen broken rate ( P  &lt; 0.05), improved germination rate ( P  &lt; 0.001), and longer pollen tube ( P  &lt; 0.01). Overall, the combination of aeration for 20 min at 4°C produced best pollen performance following sonication treatment, i.e., lowest broken rate (24.5%), highest germination rate (11.91%), and longest pollen tube (1528 μm). Furthermore, aeration treatment of pollen prior to sonication for 20 min at 4°C significantly increased kernel set of the recipient ears pollinated with the treated pollen ( Figure  3  ). Therefore, this optimal condition was used for the subsequent transformation procedure.

         Pollen Grain Morphology Following Ultrasonication Treatment 
         Under normal conditions as shown in the control group that was not treated with ultrasonication in the current study, the germination pore of maize pollen grains was covered by an operculum as shown by scanning electrical microscopic image in  Figure  4a  . However, operculums of some pollen grains were removed following ultrasonication treatments. ( Figure  4b  ). In the present study, of 225 pollen grains observed, 3 were found with removed operculums which accounted for 1.33%.

         Expression of  eGfp  in the Reproductive System 
         The enhanced  Gfp  gene ( eGfp ) cloned in the plasmid construct pLM01 and driven by the double CaMV 35S promoter (P35S promoter) was transformed to pollen grains following the ultrasonication treatments. The expression of  eGfp  was observed in a pollen tube germinated from the transformed pollen grain. No  eGfp  expression, however, was detected in the pollen tubes germinated from the pollen grains in the untransformed pollen, although pollen tubes were clearly visible ( Figure  5  ). Following controlled pollination of the  eGfp  transformed pollen treated by ultrasonication, the expression of  eGfp  in the embryos of 15 days post pollination was observed, and the average transformed embryos accounted for 33.3% ( Table  2  ) whereas the embryos from untransformed pollen did not show  eGfp  expression from all the plants ( Figure  6  ).

         Detection of  Cry1Ac  or  Apr  Gene in the Leaves of T 1  and Its Progeny Plants 
         Presence of  Cry1Ac  or  Apr  gene was analyzed in the leaves of T 1  plants. It was shown that the  Cry1Ac  or  Apr  gene was detected in the leaves of T 1  plants by PCR amplification. However, the primers were not able to amplify the gene in the untransformed maize inbred lines. The frequencies of transformed T 1  plants were summarized in  Table  3  . Insertion of  Cry1Ac  gene in the maize genome was identified by Southern blot analysis of individuals produced from self-pollinated T 1  plants with the probe specific to the gene, but no such hybridization was observed when the untransformed maize inbred line Zheng58 was used in the assay ( Figure  7  ). Segregation in T 2  seedlings analyzed by PCR also confirmed the stable transmission of foreign genes via pollen-mediated genetic transformation ( Table  4  ).

       Discussion 
       In the current study, we demonstrated that the foreign genes were transformed through pollen-mediated transformation method following ultrasonication treatment and expressed in the pollen tubes, embryos and progenies after transformation with the optimization of the pre-sonication treatment by aeration for 20 min at 4°C. 
       Male sexual reproduction system is an ideal pathway for genetic transformation. In animals, use of reproductive system in transgenic manipulation has been performed more than two decades ago ( Wagner and Hoppe, 1989 ), and lately such gene transfer technique has been widely used in different animals including livestock ( Nagano et al., 2001 ;  Oatley et al., 2004 ). In plants, attempts to use pollen as a pathway for genetic transformation have been reported by  Kumlehn et al. (2006)  and  Shim et al. (2009) . However, an efficient way for the production of transgenic plants that can be widely applied in the breeding program is needed. The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of pollen-mediated transformation, elucidated the possible mechanisms underlying the transformation, and presented evidences of such transformation at molecular and histological levels. These suggest that the method has a potential role in plant improvement due to its merits: i.e., bypassing tissue culture procedure, simple to operate and flexible in its applications in different species and varieties. 
       Ultrasonication has been used in a few studies to treat tissues or protoplasts for easy access to the genome of recipients by foreign DNA molecules in plants ( Zhang et al., 1991 ;  Joersbo and Brunstedt, 1992 ;  Wang et al., 2008 ;  Zhang et al., 2015 ) and animals ( Bao et al., 1997 ;  Miller et al., 1999 ;  Huber and Pfisterer, 2000 ;  Hirabayashi et al., 2005 ). It has been proposed that ultrasonic waves produce high pressure and high temperature lead to the localized rupture of cell wall and thus enhance permeability of the plasma membrane ( Liu et al., 2006 ;  Wang et al., 2008 ). They also suggested transient cavitation produced by sonication may have enhanced the entry of foreign DNA into pollen. Here, we demonstrated with scanning electrical microscopy that the operculum covering the pollen germination pore was removed by ultrasonication and at least in some pollen grains, this made them become more competent to receive foreign DNA. We observed the expression of  eGfp  in the major part of the pollen tube. This at least indicates the transgenicity of the vegetative cell. We also found that the expression of  eGfp  in pollen tube appeared to restrict to the tip of pollen tube where vegetative nucleus resides along with the two sperm cells. We are unable to distinguish whether  eGfp  is expressed in the vegetative cell or the generative/sperm cells or both. Since the vegetative nucleus does not contribute to the zygote formation, we suggest that the transmission of foreign genes such as  eGfp  and  Cry1Ac  to T 1  and T 2  generations is likely through the generative/sperm cells given that these cells directly contribute to the formation of the zygote. Eventually, the transgene is passed onto the progeny by the kernel containing embryo developed from the zygote as evidenced by the  eGfp  expression in T 1  embryos and  Cry1Ac  gene presence in the leaves of T 1  plants. 
       These transformed pollen grains perform as vectors to introduce exotic genetic materials into the genome of recipient plants following pollination and fertilization of theirs eggs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence to show how sonication acts on its biological target to make it permeable to allow the uptake of DNA molecules from the surrounding solution. Furthermore, this also indicates that the presence of pollen pore might be the reason to enable pollen to be used as a vector to mediate genetic transformation despite its presence of protective exine wall. 
       To understand the underlying mechanisms of this transformation system more thoroughly, subsequent studies are warranted to investigate the process how the foreign genes are transferred to generative/sperm cells employing, for instance, immuno-gold labeling at scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or TEM level, what is the frequency of such transformation relative to that to vegetative cell and the possible copy numbers of genes transferred to the generative/sperm cells through immuno-histochemical and genetic approaches. 
       In the present study, optimal pre-treatment of pollen grains by aeration of 20 min at 4°C was applied as the aeration and low temperature led to better pollen viability and kernel set. We also observed that fresh pollen could be better kept with the presence of drierite. Such improved pollen grain viability may have helped to some extent the introduction of foreign genes into the recipients due to higher successful pollination and thus improved kernel set during the experiment. Although we used field grown plants as pollen donors in the study, we observed that pollen viability can largely be maintained as long as pollen is collected in clear days according to our previous experiences over years. Therefore, the method is fairly robust and can be readily used by the breeders who do not have expensive greenhouse facilities. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the method can be improved under controlled conditions. 
       The pollen-mediated transformation system developed by our group has been proved effective in delivering foreign genes to directly generate transgenic kernels without using tissue culture procedures. The optimization of treatment conditions to pollen grains prior to sonication makes it more efficient. This system has many advantages over traditional tissue culture-based transformation system, i.e., its simplicity, fast turnaround, low costs, so that breeders can utilize such transformation system in their breeding program without excessive efforts of training and need of expensive equipment. We believe this pollen-mediated transformation system is a promising tool and will play an important role in plant breeding area.

         The Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) began in 2006 with the ambitious vision to provide a resource to help with the surge of casualties following a mass casualty incident with marrow toxic injuries. Through the efforts of the National Marrow Donor Program and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation with the support of the Office of Naval Research, the initial 13 hospitals and cancer centers have grown to 76, training over 13,500 hospital staff and conducted, funded, and supported 580 disaster exercises testing preparedness. After a decade, there is more to do, but much laudatory work has been accomplished.

  “the specter of nuclear terrorism still threatens us all.”  -President Barack Obama  June 2, 2016 address to the US Air Force Academy [ 1 ]  
 
     The Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN) began with the ambitious vision to provide a resource to help with the surge of casualties following a mass casualty incident with marrow toxic injuries. This continues to be a lofty goal that the RITN strives for, but the gap between where we were following the tragedy of 9/11 and today is significantly smaller. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) has had the great fortune to have a grant from the Office of Naval Research to conduct research to improve outcomes from hematopoietic transplantation. As part of this grant, there has been a sub-line item to conduct contingency planning in preparedness for a national disaster. This effort was half-heartedly fulfilled for a few years then the efforts were greatly accelerated following 9/11. The NMDP began by holding focus sessions with pre-imminent Hematology and Oncology physicians that were part of the NMDP’s network of transplant centers. These meetings led to the close partnership with the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) which broadened the audience and helped to continue to engage those who would be involved in a response. These focus groups, surveys, and meetings culminated in the formation of the Radiation Injury Treatment Network in 2006 with the commitment of 13 blood and bone marrow transplant units at NMDP affiliated hospitals/cancer centers. 
     Hematology and oncology teams have extensive expertise in caring for patients that have been purposefully exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The resulting complications can be directly correlated to the care needed for a radiation casualty suffering from Acute Radiation Syndrome resulting from exposure to an ionizing radiation. A radiological disaster could be as catastrophic as the detonation of an improvised nuclear device (terrorist nuclear bomb) or a less devastating incident such as a radiological exposure device (a radiological source placed in a public space), a radiological dispersal device (a.k.a. a dirty bomb where a conventional explosive spreads radiological material), a nuclear power plant accident, or a mustard agent incident. Regardless of the incident, there will be casualties that require specialized supportive care to salvage their damaged hematopoietic systems. 
     From these small beginnings, the group would debate the focus, vision, and even the name of what would become the RITN, culminating in 2006 with the signing of the first 13 contracts. This was no easy task as initially the language stated the hospitals would accept patients from a radiological disaster, which the hospital administration and legal staff expressed concern over. After going a few rounds of review, with each hospital, language that was strong enough to show commitment yet flexible enough to appease the lawyers solidified. The sales pitch to new institutions was a repeat of selling the pros of participation; imagine asking a senior administrator at a hospital if they would like to join a group of hospitals preparing to receive casualties from the detonation of a terrorist’s nuclear device. Needless to say there was some pushback. However, fortunately for RITN the physicians we worked with were passionate and persuasive. Since those humble beginnings RITN has grown into a conglomeration of 76 cancer treatment centers, hospitals, blood donor centers, and cord blood banks as of late 2016. 
     The hospitals, cancer centers and the physicians that led the charge at the initial cohort of cancer centers that joined RITN should be recognized for their efforts:   Barnes-Jewish Hospital at Washington University School of Medicine (John DiPersio, M.D.)    Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Stella Davies, M.D.)    City of Hope National Medical Center (Auayporn Nadamanee, M.D.)    Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care (Joseph Antin, M.D.)    Duke University Medical Center (Joanne Kurtzberg, M.D.)    M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Marcos deLima, M.D.)    Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (Nancy Kernan, M.D.)    Presbyterian/St. Luke’s Medical Center (Mark Brunvand, M.D.)    Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (Ann Woolfrey, M.D.)    Stanford Hospital and Clinics (Keith Stockerl-Goldstein, M.D.)    Texas Children’s Hospital (Robert Krance, M.D.)    University of Minnesota BMT Program (Margaret MacMillan, M.D.)    University of Pennsylvania Medical Center (David Porter, M.D.)

     As stated, these 13 have grown to 76 which can be seen in Fig.  1 : location of RITN centers.  Fig. 1   Location of RITN centers    
 
     To encourage participation, we appealed to each hospital’s sense of greater good as well as offered a token stipend to offset some of the costs, this grant did not cover the cost of staff time fully but at least eased the sting. To help with this effort, the funds were provided through a fee for service agreement to reduce the restrictions on how they could be used. However, to ensure that we were “getting our monies worth,” we began assigning annual tasks. These included the development of a standard operating procedure, incorporation of the RITN acute radiation syndrome treatment guidelines, training, conducting an exercise (emergency drill), and testing the satellite telephone and emergency calling card (Government Emergency Telecommunications Service) that were issued to each center. To ease this burden, we developed the training and exercise so that each center could readily apply them with minimal effort. We still ask each center to accomplish similar tasks each year; however, we have added a dozen training options so that it does not get stale and broadens the perspective on impact on a local center in the event of a nuclear disaster. This initiative grew to include training, emergency preparedness exercises, and regular workshops bringing world-renowned experts together to plan and prepare for a catastrophe, that everyone hopes will never happen. 
     RITN has developed and made available to the public many of the resources developed over the past 10 years to improve preparedness including training materials, disaster exercises/drills materials, treatment guidelines, medical order sets for adult and pediatric patients, and referral guidelines (Fig.  2 ). All of these are available on the RITN website for open use by the public; providing recognition is given to RITN as the source. Since 2006, the RITN has assisted in the training of over 13,500 medical and hospital support staff on radiological-based training. All of these materials are available for use and review on our public website [ 2 ] including links to our free web-based training. MS PowerPoint slides are available to conduct training as needed to extend the effort.  Fig. 2   RITN training and education    
 
     Since the inception of RITN, exercises have been a part of the annual requirements for each hospital. Each year, RITN would develop a tabletop exercise, where a disaster scenario would be reviewed by appropriate staff at the hospital and, when appropriate, with the emergency preparedness teams of the community. They would then provide responses to questions on what they would have done in said situation. These efforts grew to include functional exercises, where portions of the response plans are acted out, to full-scale exercises where mock casualties with moulage wound makeup, ambulances, and aircraft are mobilized for a close to realistic situation as possible. All told, over 580 exercises have been coordinated or funded by RITN from 2006 to 2016 (Fig.  3 ). RITN does not want those who are planning an exercise to duplicate previous efforts, so in addition to the after action reports from exercises, explaining the lessons learned and gaps identified, the full exercise planning and execution documents are posted for use on our website for general review [ 3 ].  Fig. 3   RITN exercises by year    
 
     Hospitals preparing for a mass casualty incident require more than training and exercises. Just-in-time tools are often requested, and we have tried to meet these needs through the development of many resources. These include the RITN ARS Treatment Guidelines, RITN Hospital Referral Guidelines, RITN Concept of Operations, the Adult and Pediatric Medical Ordersets (which were developed in coordination with the Radiation Emergency Medical Management (REMM) website) for implementation of a standard approach to patient care for those individuals who might experience an acute radiation illness. 
     RITN has come a long way; we still see many challenges ahead; need for continued growth of the network, how to engage distant unused medical capacity through telemedicine, and increasing awareness within the medical and public health community, as well as many other local issues that are identified during the exercises we support. However, based on the great success we have seen to date, we are confident that the Radiation Injury Treatment Network will continue to step up to the challenge presented. 
     RITN’s mission and goals are as follows[ 4 ]:  The Radiation Injury Treatment Network® (RITN) provides comprehensive evaluation and treatment for victims of radiation exposure or other marrow toxic injuries.  Many of the casualties with radiation injury will be salvageable but require outpatient and/or inpatient care. Recognizing this, the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), US Navy and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) collaboratively developed RITN, which comprises of medical centers with expertise in the management of bone marrow failure, stem cell donor centers and umbilical cord blood banks across the US.  
 
     The goals of RITN are as follows:   
 to develop treatment guidelines for managing hematologic toxicity among victims of radiation exposure ,    
 to educate health care professionals about pertinent aspects of radiation exposure management ,    
 to help coordinate the medical response to radiation events, and 
    
 to provide comprehensive evaluation and treatment for victims at participating centers .   
 
     Since RITNs inception, it has been fortunate to have many partners including the support of the Office of Naval Research, Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the Radiation Emergency Medical Management website operated by the National Library of Medicine as well as many other prominent supporters including the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) National Alliance for Radiation Readiness (NARR), European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), World Health Organization-Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network, Radiation Emergency Assistance Center and Training Site (REAC/TS), and many others.

         This paper charts the history of the Rockefeller Foundation’s participation in the collection and long-term preservation of genetic diversity in crop plants from the 1940s through the 1970s. In the decades following the launch of its agricultural program in Mexico in 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation figured prominently in the creation of world collections of key economic crops. Through the efforts of its administrators and staff, the foundation subsequently parlayed this experience into a leadership role in international efforts to conserve so-called plant genetic resources. Previous accounts of the Rockefeller Foundation’s interventions in international agricultural development have focused on the outcomes prioritized by foundation staff and administrators as they launched assistance programs and especially their characterization of the peoples and “problems” they encountered abroad. This paper highlights instead how foundation administrators and staff responded to a newly emergent international agricultural concern—the loss of crop genetic diversity. Charting the foundation’s responses to this concern, which developed only after agricultural modernization had begun and was understood to be produced by the successes of the foundation’s own agricultural assistance programs, allows for greater interrogation of how the foundation understood and projected its central position in international agricultural research activities by the 1970s.

       Introduction 
       In 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation launched a program in Mexico that aimed to increase agricultural production through greater research and training in the agricultural sciences. Many scholars have looked to this effort as the starting point of the so-called Green Revolution—that is, of the striking increase seen in the production of certain economic crops in Latin America and Asia in the late 1950s and 1960s that resulted especially from the introduction of higher-yielding crop varieties and the agricultural technologies and financial structures needed to cultivate these (Jennings  1988 ; Perkins  1997 ; Cotter  2003 ; Harwood  2009 ,  2012 ; Cullather  2010 ; Patel  2013 ). In establishing this narrative, historians have traced the foundation’s efforts from Mexico across Latin America in the 1940s and 50s, to India, Pakistan and elsewhere in Asia in the 1960s and 70s, and finally to Africa where these faltered in the 1980s and later (Oasa  1981 ; Fitzgerald  1986 ; Matchett  2002 ,  2006 ; Cullather  2004 ; Shepherd  2005 ; Smith  2009 ; Baranski  2015 ). The outcomes of these activities remain contested, hailed by some as having prevented global food crises and decried by others as the source of innumerable social and environmental problems. 1 
 
       Much of the historical literature that has evaluated the agricultural assistance programs of the Rockefeller Foundation from the 1940s onward has focused on the outcomes that were vigorously pursued from the outset. These include especially the creation and dissemination of high-yielding varieties of key economic crops and the broad political agendas, such as transforming potentially volatile peasants into cooperative capitalist farmers, that were encoded in seemingly narrow breeding efforts. Some of these studies have explored how the prior experiences and assumptions of foundation officers and staff affected what they defined as problems worthy of attention in the countries they visited as well as the solutions they proposed (e.g., Fitzgerald  1986 ; Shepherd  2005 ; Smith  2009 ; Nally and Taylor  2015 ). The perspectives of foundation officers about the need for agricultural assistance and the form it should take were not developed in isolation but reflected contemporary theories of economic development and were bound closely to US geopolitical concerns and strategies for national security in the midst of the Cold War; these, too, have been consistent themes in studies of the Rockefeller Foundation’s agricultural programs (e.g., Oasa  1981 ; Perkins  1997 ; Cullather  2010 ). 
       Although it complements these many studies, the history that I relate here differs in its approach to understanding the post-1940 agricultural programming of the Rockefeller Foundation and its wide-ranging effects. I explore a component of the foundation’s interventions in global agriculture—its participation in the collection and long-term preservation of genetic diversity in agricultural plants—that was not prompted by the perceived shortcomings of developing-world agriculturists or governments but instead arose as a means of managing some less desirable consequences of the foundation’s own activities. As I describe here, in the decades following the launch of the agricultural program in Mexico in 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation figured prominently in the creation of collections in which many thousands of varieties of important economic crops were gathered. I show how, through the efforts of its administrators and staff, the foundation subsequently parlayed this experience into a leadership role in international efforts to conserve “plant genetic resources” as these coalesced in the late 1960s. 
       These activities have had long-term—indeed, continuing—consequences for international agricultural research and development. The institutions favored by the Rockefeller Foundation as centers of collection and conservation, whose histories I recount here, still play central roles in the management and global circulation of plant genetic materials, especially for key economic crops such as rice, maize and wheat. 2 
 
       The history of the Rockefeller Foundation’s involvement in the collection and long-term maintenance of crop genetic diversity aligns with the existing scholarship in showing the influence of the foundation’s resources and vision on crucial elements of agricultural production at local and global scales. Yet because of the particular nature of the problem of the loss of genetically diverse types, exploring this history allows for greater interrogation of how the foundation (as embodied in its staff) came to understand and position itself as an undisputed authority in international agricultural research. This is because the loss of genetically diverse types became an urgent international concern only  after  agricultural modernization had begun, and was in fact understood to be produced by the very successes of the foundation’s agricultural programs. Here the problem to be solved could not be explained by reference to the failures of backwards farming communities or addressed by imposing an imported vision of good agriculture. It was acknowledged to be a product of the foundation’s own activities. What’s more, it invited the interest of other organizations, who found themselves engaged in resolving an issue seen to be exacerbated by agricultural modernization as pursued by the Rockefeller Foundation. As a result, this history offers an opportunity to consider how the foundation viewed its authority in the domain of global agriculture vis-à-vis that of other national and international actors. 
     
     
       Mexican maize diversity 
       The Rockefeller Foundation’s first forays into the collection of crop plant diversity in the 1940s were intended not as conservation activities but rather as the initial steps towards specific agricultural objectives: the creation and distribution of higher-yielding crop plants for Mexican farmers. Within a few short years, however, concerns about the potential loss of the diverse types of maize (corn) found in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America transformed a working collection—that is, one used for the immediate research needs of breeders and other scientists on site—into a resource to be expanded and stewarded for the future. 
       In October 1943 the Rockefeller Foundation entered into an agreement with the Mexican government in which it agreed to provide Mexico with technical expertise in agricultural research, with the aim of improving national agricultural productivity, via a new American-staffed Office of Special Studies in the Ministry of Agriculture. It followed that a top priority for this office was to establish programs in plant breeding, as the development of high-yielding varieties of important economic and subsistence crops like maize, wheat, and beans promised a straightforward route to increased agricultural production. 3 
 
       One of the first activities to be undertaken in the maize-breeding program, which was directed by the American geneticist and breeder Edwin Wellhausen, was to establish a collection of locally adapted Mexican maize varieties (today called landraces). The stated purpose of collecting was to support the maize improvement efforts; however, it was further encouraged by more academic interests. As a consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation, the Harvard botanist and maize breeder Paul Mangelsdorf had been instrumental first in shaping the Mexican program, then in launching the Office of Special Studies and setting an agenda for its maize program (Matchett  2002 ). He had also been engaged in the study of maize’s evolutionary origins for a number of years, work in which he relied on varieties gathered from across the Americas. His passion for both breeding and evolutionary studies influenced subsequent ambitions for and uses of the collection (Mangelsdorf  1974 ). 
       Foundation staff made the first collections of maize while driving across the Mexican countryside. According to Wellhausen, they gathered many varieties, “right along the road, as we went from one place to another.” 4  Over time, the collecting activities became more methodical. Wellhausen was soon dispatching students from the nearby university to gather maize from all corners of the country. They were provided with “bags and tags and money to travel” and relied on buses and sometimes burros to travel to what Wellhausen called “the hinterlands.” 5  Once they had arrived at remote sites, collectors often faced a still more difficult task. Collecting diverse types of maize frequently meant negotiating with impoverished farmers for access to a precious resource. 6 
 
       The collectors’ persistence paid off. In 1943, when the collections had only just begun, Wellhausen reported the “very large number” of more than 200 maize types held by the Office of Special Studies. 7  By 1947 the collection included some “1500 varieties of corn” and Wellhausen and his colleagues, encouraged by Mangelsdorf, had begun an effort to classify these and definitively establish their relationships to one another. 8 
 
       Almost from the outset those associated with the Office of Special Studies recognized that their maize-breeding program, if it were successful, would produce more desirable strains of maize that might well replace the many diverse types they now encountered in Mexican fields. This loss would be a blow to breeding efforts and botanical studies alike. When Wellhausen and his colleagues published the results of their classificatory effort, they both acknowledged this concern and assigned themselves a central role in addressing it: “The modern corn breeder… has a responsibility not only to improve the maize in the country in which he works, but also to recognize, to describe, and to preserve for future use, the varieties and races which his own improved productions tend to replace and in some cases to extinguish” (Wellhausen et al.  1952 , foreword). 
       As it turned out, this notion was more widely shared. In 1949 the German geneticist Friedrich Brieger of the Universidade de São Paulo voiced his concern over the likely disappearance of maize varieties across the Americas to the botanist Ralph Cleland, who was then the chairman of the Division of Biology and Agriculture of the US National Research Council (NRC). 9  Brieger’s dire predictions of varieties being lost within ten years inspired Cleland to assess interest in a conservation effort among his colleagues and potential funders. Within a couple of years, a small group of US scientists had formed a “Committee on the Preservation of Indigenous Strains of Maize” (hereafter, Maize Committee) under the auspices of the NRC (Clark  1956 ; Curry  2017 ). Its initial members included a number of botanists and geneticists, including Mangelsdorf, whose research had already sparked their interest in maize diversity. Convinced of the likely loss of diverse—and valuable—maize varieties resulting from the introduction of improved lines, members of the Maize Committee obtained a grant from the US Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) to finance a hemispheric effort to collect and preserve these imperiled varieties. Their arguments for why an agency concerned with offering “technical assistance” to developing countries should support their work emphasized the essential role that the endangered varieties would play in future maize-improvement efforts across Latin America; however, they also called attention to the benefits to US agriculture and to scientific research. 10 
 
       The Maize Committee, relying especially on Mangelsdorf as an intermediary, also sought to secure the aid of the Rockefeller Foundation on the ground in Latin America. J. George Harrar, the director of the program in Mexico, and his colleagues clearly saw the value of the Maize Committee’s work for their future activities. As Harrar argued to the foundation president Chester Bernard, “The importance of maintaining viable germplasm of native crop plants such as corn is obvious and of tremendous significance in the development of new varieties of corn to meet future problems.” 11  He pointed out that the foundation had been doing this work for years, spending considerable sums in the creation of a maize collection in Mexico and, more recently, in Colombia where a second Latin American program had been launched in 1950. They were, in his assessment, in possession of unparalleled resources: “If we accept the proposal of the NRC committee we will immediately make available to them the most important maize material now in existence.” 12  Bernard agreed with Harrar, but expressed reservations that the committee had not adequately considered the question of maintaining these varieties in the long-term. He worried that this expensive commitment would devolve to the foundation and insisted that the foundation not commit itself to providing for the indefinite maintenance of the collected maize. 13 
 
       On that understanding, the Rockefeller Foundation signed on to the Maize Committee’s planned program. Over the next few years, the foundation supervised collecting missions and provided land and space for multiplying and renewing collected seeds. The NRC, using the $85,000 grant from the TCA, paid for equipment, supplies, travel expenses, and salaries associated with collecting. TCA funds also supported the creation of three storage centers to house the collections—located in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil—with additional “stand-by” storage at a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) site in Maryland. Both the Mexican and Colombian centers were linked to Rockefeller Foundation operations. The Mexican storage facility was at Chapingo, the field site of the Office of Special Studies and home to Wellhausen’s earlier maize collections, while the Colombian storage facility was sited at the new Rockefeller Foundation outpost in Medellín. 14 
 
       The Maize Committee quickly achieved its goal of amassing seeds of diverse types. By 1955, the committee claimed a total of 11,353 samples of maize from across the Americas, 10,922 of which had been officially catalogued and many thousands of which were duplicated in stand-by storage. 15 
 
       This success created new problems, as the question of long-term maintenance and renewal of these collections in Latin America lingered. Although the Maize Committee had hoped to establish an endowment to support the storage centers in perpetuity, no donor materialized. In a heated exchange of 1953, foundation staff including Harrar took great offense at the Maize Committee’s (to their minds) cavalier assumption, outlined in a further grant proposal, that the foundation would go on maintaining and distributing the collected maize varieties at its own expense. 16  Yet this is what eventually happened. 
     
     
       New crops, new collections, new concerns 
       During the 1960s Rockefeller Foundation staff continued to emphasize the importance of collections of crop diversity to the success of crop improvement programs, and increasingly saw a clear role for the foundation in maintaining these collections. This was due in part to the foundation’s sponsorship of a greater number of agricultural initiatives. As it expanded its horizons from Mexico and Colombia to all of Latin America and then to South and Southeast Asia and beyond, the foundation generated a need for access to more and different crops. Perhaps more important, as staff members from the flagship Mexico program fanned out to these new sites, they brought with them a sense of the important role that the collection of diverse varieties had played in the successes of the Mexican program—and they endeavored to repeat that experience. 
       In 1956, in the midst of the maize collecting efforts in Latin America, the Rockefeller Foundation entered into an agreement with the Government of India to create a cooperative research program at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi. As the program got off the ground in 1957 and 1958, a maize-breeding initiative was the first to be established, followed shortly by an effort to improve sorghum and millets (Perkins  1997 , pp. 153–154). Kenneth Rachie, formerly of the Office of Special Studies in Mexico, led the latter project. He immediately proposed collecting sorghum varieties just as “extensive collections of corn germ plasm” had been made in Latin America. “It is quite obvious that such collections played an important part in excellent development of maize improvement programs in Mexico and Colombia,” he noted. Although Rachie envisioned that Indian materials would be the starting point for the collections, he hoped that “introductions from other countries would be added … and eventually a world sorghum bank would be established.” 17  Rachie considered this to be in the known remit of the foundation: “Establishment of world germplasm banks has been an important function of the Rockefeller Foundation agricultural programs in the past.” 18  Rachie soon organized an India-wide collecting program in which Indian collectors sought out locally adapted varieties of sorghum, maize, and millets. He further supplemented the collection with materials from other institutions, as well as a sorghum collection that he had brought with him from Mexico, to create his envisioned “world collection” (House  1980 , p. 98). 
       A similar tale unfolded beginning in 1960 at a different Rockefeller-linked institution, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. Jointly funded by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and directed initially by a former staff member of the Office of Special Studies, IRRI’s mission was to raise rice production across Asia through enhanced scientific research and training. As with the program in Mexico, breeding high-yielding varieties took center stage. And, as with the earlier maize and sorghum efforts, rice breeding began with an effort to assemble at IRRI as many rice varieties as possible. Because many agricultural institutions already possessed large collections of rice varieties, the primary method of collecting was to write to these institutions to see whether they would share their materials. By the end of 1972, the collection included nearly 7000 accessions, and had benefited from the donation of extensive materials from the USDA, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Japan, and Taiwan (Chandler  1992 , pp. 103–104). 
       The brief overviews of the collecting programs offered here—especially of maize in the Americas and sorghum, maize, and millets in India—give little sense of the labor and resources required to assemble and maintain a collection of diverse crop varieties, even for a circumscribed region. To gather the sorghum, maize, and millet varieties of India, Rachie relied on seven lead field collectors from India. Prior to visiting any area Rachie and his collaborators had to gather information about the nature and location of crops likely to be found there, as well as the predicted time of harvest; they also had to contact local agricultural officials and receive permission, and in many cases assistance, to carry out the work of collecting. Taking a sample involved gathering the seeds, wrapping these in cloth and bagging them, completing a standardized data form in duplicate, packing the bags into further metal containers or burlap bags, and sending these back to New Delhi. As Rachie summarized, “Field collecting was found to be hard, exhausting work.” The collectors nonetheless accumulated 2463 samples of sorghum, 1582 of maize, and 2165 of varied millets—having spent a collective 674 days in the field and an additional 116 days planning the missions and having traveled an estimated 79,118 miles while in the field. 19 
 
       Collecting was indeed hard, exhausting work. But, in many respects, maintenance proved harder still. It was only after seeds arrived at a storage facility that the never-ending tasks of maintenance began—processing seeds for storage, classifying the accessions, developing a system for tracking these and storing data, growing out seeds to regenerate stocks, making samples available to breeders worldwide and so on. An illustration of just how difficult maintenance proved is the history of the Latin American maize collection in the mid 1960s. This collection had been shepherded by the Rockefeller Foundation from the days of the Maize Committee through the closing of the Office of Special Studies in 1959 and then the inauguration of a new Inter-American Maize Improvement Program the same year. As institutional histories proudly note, the collection held by this latter program became the core material for the “genebank” of a new International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT) established in 1966 under an agreement between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Government (Taba et al.  2004 ). But what was the collection like at that time? As Mario Gutiérrez, the scientist hired to curate the CIMMYT genebank, later described, “What CIMMYT had in 1967 could not be classified as a bank but merely as a dump.” Seeds produced for the bank sat idly in tin cans awaiting proper storage, the refrigeration equipment was broken, and within the cold rooms disorganization reigned. According to Gutiérrez, “No true inventory existed and staff members had to spend sometimes as much as a week trying to locate the seed they wished.” 20  Collecting, therefore, was only the beginning—and in some sense, the comparatively easy beginning—of a much more arduous task. 
       Though the collections may not have been as perfect as their originators would have wished them to be, and the task of maintenance an ongoing challenge, in the 1960s the international agricultural research institutes (CIMMYT and IRRI) and the agricultural program in India had some of the most comprehensive collections of varietal diversity in key economic crops found anywhere in world. 21  The Rockefeller Foundation, as patron, had played a central role in bringing these into being. 
     
     
       An international gene bank and the World Germplasm Project 
       While programs supported by the Rockefeller Foundation were accumulating massive numbers of varieties of select crops for the primary (though not exclusive) use of agricultural researchers affiliated with these programs, a growing number of breeders, botanists, and other biologists had begun to make calls for more, and more extensive, such collections. The 1960s saw increasing agitation for international efforts to gather and protect in perpetuity the vast genetic diversity in agricultural plants—and not just a few key crops but a wide range of species important to human social and economic activities. These calls prompted Rockefeller Foundation staff to develop, for the first time, an overarching vision for the foundation’s role in stewarding collections of crop varieties and to articulate a position on this newly international and now more strongly conservation-oriented issue. 
       What was behind this heightened concern for crop diversity? One short answer is the work of the international agricultural research institutes and other development initiatives. By encouraging farmers to transition to high-yielding varieties as part of a larger package of agricultural change, programs such as the those of the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico and India and institutions like CIMMYT and IRRI were seen as having expedited a transition away from the use of genetically diverse landraces that agriculturists had noted and worried about since the late-nineteenth century. For some observers, these worries were further stimulated by a more general concern about ecological change; as a Dutch agricultural official described in 1973, “This is not only a matter of agriculture and developing countries but also a matter of… the concern of so many people today with our environment.” 22 
 
       Of those organizations that responded to concern about the loss of genetic diversity in crop plants, two of the most important were FAO and an international research initiative called the International Biological Programme (IBP). It was members of an IBP committee who first produced a categorization of threatened “genetic resources” and indicated priorities for conservation within these. Hoping to transform their assessment into action, at least in the realm of agriculture, IBP members reached out to FAO (Frankel and Bennett  1970a , preface; Pistorius  1997 , ch. 1–2). Founded in October 1945 as a permanent UN agency in the domain of food and agriculture, FAO had played a role in the coordination of plant exploration and the creation of global catalogues of varieties of major food crops since the late 1940s. The joint efforts of the IBP and FAO led to a 1967 FAO/IBP Technical Conference on the Exploration, Utilization and Conservation of Plant Genetic Resources, the aims of which were to chart conservation concerns related to “plant genetic resources,” survey current activities, and create a plan of action for the future (Frankel and Bennett  1970a ; Pistorius  1997 , ch. 2). 
       The plan elaborated at the 1967 conference was focused on stemming the perceived tide of losses. The first step would be to produce a survey of “genetic resources in the field”—that is, an assessment of the location and extent of “primitive material” (landraces) and the wild relatives of crops (also considered useful as potential breeding material). This global survey, coordinated through a central agency, would in turn serve as a guide for collecting the plants identified. Another survey would chart existing collections at institutions throughout the world. All of these genetic resources would then be classified, evaluated, documented, and conserved for the long term. The key recommendation of the 1967 conference was the creation or designation of “international seed storage facilities,” in particular an “international gene bank… available to all nations.” Finally, bringing all of these linked elements together would necessitate high-level coordination and oversight. Having agreed that this “can only come from [a] United Nations agency,” the summary indicated that FAO and its Unit on Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources and Genetic Resources Information Centre would be the obvious choice (Frankel and Bennett  1970b , pp. 13–17). 
       Although FAO may have seemed the logical institution to nominate as coordinating body for these activities, its status as a UN agency and mandate to improve food and agricultural production worldwide did not translate into clear international authority and effectiveness. The early ambitions for FAO to address world hunger through direct measures such as the reorganization of commodity markets, emergency food relief, and credit schemes to foster agricultural development were forestalled especially by British and US policymakers. US officials in particular wanted to promote free markets and, in the midst of the Cold War, retain the use of food aid as means of influencing leaders of developing nations and fostering goodwill abroad. As a result, FAO never received the funding or powers it needed to tackle hunger head-on, and its role in its early decades was limited largely to offering technical assistance and compiling statistics (Marchisio and Di Blase  1991 ; Staples  2006 ). 
       In the late 1960s, limited financial resources and authority remained a constraint on FAO activities. Although it had increased its operational programming, its technical assistance remained, according to one historical assessment, “modest in comparison to other, particularly bilateral, sources” of such assistance (Marchisio and Di Blase  1991 , p. 61). Perhaps equally troublesome for the proposals of the 1967 conference, these years represented a period of transition at FAO. A multifaceted campaign against hunger begun in the early 1960s was curtailed in favor of a narrower focus on scientific and technical assistance and, under new leadership, FAO restructured both its internal organization and its programming priorities (Marchisio and Di Blase  1991 , pp. 72–73; Staples  2006 , p. 121). In the midst of these changes, the ambitious conservation agenda articulated at the FAO/IBP Technical Conference and envisioned as a task for FAO remained on paper, even as interest in the issue of plant genetic resources continued to mount in both national and international circles. 
       Confronted by this growing international concern, which not only emerged from the Rockefeller Foundation’s past activities but also potentially threatened its future work, foundation administrators moved to position themselves and their agricultural institutes as the most knowledgeable and effective agents in managing global crop diversity. However, they characterized this issue not as one of general conservation action, intended foremost to prevent a cascade of losses in crop species and their wild relatives, but rather as a targeted need to locate and make available to breeders increasingly rare “indigenous varieties” of major crops. 
       The director of the foundation’s agricultural sciences program, Sterling Wortman, offered a first formal assessment in March 1969. “During the past 25 years, The Rockefeller Foundation has contributed to science and to world agriculture by assisting in the collection, storage and evaluation of the world’s basic food crops—corn, wheat, rice, sorghum, and the millets,” Wortman noted. Yet further work remained to be done to “complete” collection and evaluation in these crops “before the indigenous varieties are further displaced by newer high-yielding types.” Wortman suggested that it would take two years for a group of experts to generate a status report on existing collections worldwide, which would then serve as a guide for gathering what diversity remained. He further indicated that the established international agricultural institutes (e.g., CIMMYT and IRRI) would be central hubs for these activities, organizing the collections and ensuring their availability to “the scientists who can make best use of them.” 23 
 
       Why was such an effort required of the Rockefeller Foundation? Subsequent summaries emphasized that the foundation’s successes had drawn on collections of genetic diversity and that future efforts would depend on similar resources. “Results attained through the use of… genetically diverse resources have been spectacular, particularly in rice, wheat, and maize,” summarized one proposal, referring to the foundation’s programs in Latin America and Asia. “To maintain the achieved high levels of production of these and for the improvement of other basic food crops, we are entirely dependent on the availability of material in the germplasm banks.” 24 
 
       Another important reason for the foundation to develop an overarching plan for the management of crop diversity was a widespread perception that they had played a role in placing such resources at risk. Even if it did not come up explicitly in many foundation reports and proposals, it always lurked between the lines. How could it not, when one of the most common examples offered to indicate the urgency of creating new collections was the spread of the Rockefeller-sponsored wheat and rice varieties? 25  Foundation officers were well aware of this view. 26  As such, the foundation was not just addressing an unfolding agricultural problem that it had the experience and resources to take on. It was addressing a problem generated in part through its own activities. 
       Finally, foundation officers may well have worried about other institutions encroaching on activities (the collection and maintenance of landraces) that were not only areas of extensive investment on the part of the foundation, but also tasks central to the identity and importance of the agricultural research institutes. Although Wortman and his colleagues recognized that cooperation with institutions such as FAO would be essential in any international germplasm conservation effort, they tellingly did not reach out to these institutions in their initial planning. Instead, they dismissed them. The consensus of an April 1969 meeting, for example, was that the FAO/IBP proposals had arrived at a dead end—they would “remain on paper.” 27 
 
       Empowered by their experiences in this field, concerned about the future viability of their programs, cognizant of their role in imperiling genetic resources, and likely aiming to continue as leaders in a newly crowded enterprise, those in the Rockefeller Foundation’s agricultural sciences program forged ahead. In short order, they nominated four expert individuals—one each for maize, rice, wheat, and sorghum and millets—who in turn assembled a group that he and Foundation staff considered the best qualified to collectively establish the status of existing collections, gaps in these collections, and plans needed to ensure “continued and improved protection” of global germplasm resources. 28 
 
       The summary statements to emerge from these efforts converged on a few themes. The first was that many varieties were indeed in danger of disappearing and further collection activities should be undertaken. A second was that oversight of collecting and maintenance should be done on a crop-specific basis and in most cases left to the care of the established agricultural research institutes. The wheat committee, for example, argued that CIMMYT, because of its “unique character and role as an international center of research… would be the logical institution to serve as the coordinator” for the activities recommended by the committee. Rather than attempt to build a centralized collection, or even a centralized effort, the committees generally agreed that each institute was best left to undertake independently the conservation efforts that its researchers felt most desirable. 29 
 
       In April 1972, the Rockefeller Foundation dedicated the comparatively modest sum of $350,000 “toward the costs of completing the collection of the world germplasm of corn, wheat, rice, sorghum, and millets,” stipulating that this was to be used within a three-year period. The assumed recipients of this grant money were IRRI (for work on rice), CIMMYT (for wheat and maize), an as-yet-only-proposed International Center for Research in the Semi-Arid Tropics (later ICRISAT; for sorghum and the millets), and the Plant Introduction Research office of the USDA (presumably for collecting missions). 30 
 
       The limited plan for protecting “world germplasm” formulated at the Rockefeller Foundation by 1972 was a far cry from the ambitious vision articulated at the FAO/IBP Technical Conference a few years earlier. It aimed at creating better collections of a handful of crops—crops that because of their economic importance had already been the focus of Rockefeller Foundation collections and that were arguably best represented in national and other collections—and to do so within established institutions and without global oversight. Its central objective was to ensure the long-term availability of precious resources to breeders. The FAO/IBP vision on the other hand was not limited to the core commodity crops of global agriculture but instead articulated a need for widespread conservation action, and furthermore emphasized the conservation aspects of the work over utilization. It made a strong case for the creation of new institutions, including regional seed banks and an international coordinating body. Finally, while the FAO/IBP proposal aimed at the development of an on-going effort, with permanent institutional support and activities projected for the indefinite future, foundation officers preferred to think that they were closing the door on this issue. Wortman described the World Germplasm Project as “the systematic completion of the collection of the cereal grains.” 31 
 
     
     
       CGIAR and the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources 
       Although Rockefeller Foundation administrators expressed skepticism about the ability of FAO and IBP to follow through on the ambitious scheme articulated at the FAO/IBP Technical Conference, the promoters of that scheme had not lost hope. In 1971 they laid their call for an internationally coordinated effort to conserve genetically diverse crops at the feet of a newly organized international body, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), describing it as a concern that threatened the entire future of agricultural development. From 1971 until 1973, members of CGIAR, an organization whose mandate was to coordinate international aid for agricultural research in developing countries, grappled with the challenge of addressing this complex global conservation concern. 
       The origins of CGIAR, much like the rising concern about “germplasm resources,” lie in the Rockefeller Foundation’s escalating activities in the area of agricultural assistance. In the 1960s, the costs to the foundation (as well as its partner, the Ford Foundation) of operating the international agricultural research institutes—which by 1967 included CIMMYT, IRRI, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA)—escalated rapidly. Although the foundations wished to see these continue, they did not envision themselves as permanent financial backers. By 1969 they had initiated talks with various governments and international organizations, seeking relief from the enormous financial obligations the institutes entailed. These negotiations resulted in the 1971 formation of CGIAR, the purpose of which was to coordinate research activities that addressed the agricultural needs of developing countries. It worked primarily by directing funds from donors to the existing agricultural institutes, creating new institutes organized on the same basic model, and coordinating research efforts among all of these (CGIAR Secretariat  1971 ; Baum and Lejeune  1986 ). 
       From the outset, it was clear that the high-level officials who gathered as CGIAR at regular meetings would need a source of scientific and technical advice in order to effectively coordinate research at an international level. Its members therefore decided that CGIAR would have its own Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), comprising twelve scientists with expertise in agriculture and development. It was through this committee that the creation of a coordinated system to conserve crop plant diversity was presented to CGIAR as a pressing need for international agricultural research. 
       From the outset, the most hotly contested element of proposed genetic conservation activities was the role that would be given to FAO. The initial plan brought to the TAC in 1971 by staff of the Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources Unit of FAO called for the creation of eleven “genetic resources centres” to collect and maintain crop varieties and a coordinating body that would be “planned and supervised by internationally recognized experts,” staffed with trained personnel, and provided access to “crop specialists” to act as advisers. FAO estimated the initial five-year cost of $5 to $6.5 million to support eight or nine centers for a five-year period. It identified no new costs associated with the coordinating body—presumably because it envisioned that the existing FAO Unit would assume them. This latter assumption raised immediate objections (FAO  1971 ). As Otto Frankel, a central figure in the 1967 FAO/IBP Technical Conference and chair of an FAO “Panel of Experts” on plant exploration and conservation, described: “The FAO Unit concerned with genetic resources… has a staff of three professional people who are overworked and would be wholly inadequate… They have not achieved—indeed, barely attempted—the much easier task of coordinating the work of those existing institutions which could now act as such a network.” 32 
 
       Other CGIAR members shared Frankel’s concern about FAO’s presumed leadership, especially representatives of the Rockefeller Foundation. As one foundation officer summarized, “Essentially the main points of difficulty arise from the fact that FAO would presume to bring under its control the coordinating body, and there are serious reservations about the ability of FAO to develop the strategies for a comprehensive germplasm program.” Although FAO, by virtue of its particular mandate, seemed to him a logical institution to take on international coordination, he felt that “nevertheless, FAO’s history in bureaucratic procedures and program execution leaves something to be desired.” 33  (His assessment of course left aside the question of whether FAO had ever had the resources it needed to effectively carry out programming.) He and other administrators were quick to point out who did have such experience: the Rockefeller Foundation. Through its World Germplasm Project, the foundation had begun to coordinate efforts among international institutions—albeit those to which it was already closely connected—in order to gather and preserve crop diversity. Foundation officers felt that these activities had not been adequately taken into account in discussions about the formation of a new genetic resources network. 34 
 
       In addition to questioning FAO’s overall capacity for program management, Rockefeller Foundation administrators raised concerns about its comparative weakness in more specialized areas of expertise. These included in particular the technical enterprises of collecting and maintaining seed stocks. To representatives of the foundation, the creation of new genetic resources centers under FAO oversight would take control out of the hands of those with the most relevant experience. In Wortman’s estimation, “Clearly, only international research centers [e.g., CIMMYT, IRRI] can really implement plans, including collection, evaluation, description, and maintenance… FAO can and would cooperate, but its officers generally would agree that action should rest with institutes, with FAO handling pub[licity]… descriptions, promotion of use of the resources, and arrangements for [international] cooperation in the evaluation of materials.” 35 
 
       In summer 1973, after a number of TAC subcommittee meetings and several iterations of proposals, a revised plan came from FAO to CGIAR for its consideration. Surprisingly, given the tenor of the meetings and negotiations that preceded it, this proposal placed even greater control in the hands of FAO, emphasized the limitations of the existing agricultural institutes, and replaced a previously planned independent advisory panel of scientists with the FAO Panel of Experts. Unsurprisingly, Rockefeller Foundation representatives stridently objected. Once again they couched their objections in terms of their previous experience. “It seems to us that this is a scientific undertaking which must be controlled at all times… by the very best scientific judgment,” Wortman began. “Once the funds [for collecting] become available, we find literally thousands of collections coming in… One can be dealing with a bottomless pit of collection if we do not have careful scientific control.” 36  The implication was that FAO, a political organization, would not be in a position to manage competing demands for collection from varied national and regional entities. By comparison the agricultural institutes, with their in-house scientific expertise and their prior experience in managing the “thousands of collections” rolling in, would be far better positioned. 
       In the wake of the 1973 proposal and ensuing discussions, a subcommittee of CGIAR finally generated terms of reference and an operational plan for an International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) that would be accepted by CGIAR. At the first meeting of this subcommittee, Lewis Roberts, associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation’s Agricultural Sciences program, propounded the views of the foundation. He argued first that the focus of any effort should be “the relatively few crops that supply man with most of his food” primarily on the grounds of cost, especially the cost of maintaining, evaluating, and sharing stocks. “A very sharp focus of a global genetic resources program will be required in order to keep it from becoming so broad and unwieldy that it cannot be adequately financed or managed to ensure its success.” His second major bid was for a governing board “with a high degree of autonomy,” which he thought was not ensured in the proposal of an expanded FAO unit operating in conjunction with its own Panel of Experts. 37  According to Roberts’s account of the meeting, his proposal won favor over one advanced by FAO representatives. Roberts was subsequently asked to form a small sub-subcommittee together with members from UK and West Germany (and, notably, no one from FAO) to draft the terms of reference and plan of operation for the envisioned governing board. 38 
 
       Although FAO had announced its intention of expanding its Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources Unit so as to be able to coordinate international conservation efforts, its central role in the finalized terms of reference was to provide a secretariat and maintain a trust fund for an independent board of experts who would be answerable primarily to CGIAR and its TAC. The activities of the IBPGR were described as giving priority to “species of major economic importance and their wild and cultivated relatives.” 39  In this work, its chief collaborators would be the established international agricultural research institutes and several new institutions just then coming on line under the auspices of CGIAR, which would be tasked with maintaining the core world collections of key economic crops such as maize, wheat, and rice. In other words, a narrow vision that supported established approaches to and institutions for agricultural development displaced the more encompassing FAO (and earlier IBP/FAO) vision of advancing food security through the conservation of a broad range of crops and the distribution of this work and the resources necessary to support it to a range of national and international actors. This outcome reflected a broader pattern that historians have identified at FAO that began in the late 1960s and became more apparent through early 1970s, in which “the FAO lost its leadership on the issue of agricultural development” (Staples  2006 , p. 121; see also Marchisio and Di Blase  1991 ). 
       The proposal hammered out by Roberts and others on the sub-committee was one that the Rockefeller Foundation was happy to support. It provided initial funds that would be used (alongside larger donations from West Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) to get the new IBPGR up and running. In addition, Roberts—in spite of his concern in January 1974 that FAO was trying “to move in and take over major control of the Board” by orchestrating the creation of a list of candidate members of IBPGR—was invited to be among the initial twelve members, assuring the foundation a voice in all of its early proceedings. 40 
 
     
     
       Conclusion 
       Accounts by other scholars have ably demonstrated how the Rockefeller Foundation’s interventions in international agriculture were shaped by its administrators’ and personnel’s assessments of the kinds of farmers and modes of agricultural production they encountered (or imagined) in the developing world. Here I have traced instead the crucial role played by the foundation’s growing sense of its own central position in global agricultural development—and belief in its great skill in producing desirable outcomes—in shaping its activities. This, too, is an essential element to consider in understanding the history of its agricultural work in the later twentieth century. 
       The Rockefeller Foundation’s gradually expanding ambitions, from immediate local concerns to projected global needs, is evident in the trajectory of its involvement in seed collection and conservation. The foundation’s role in maintaining genetic stocks began as a small-scale enterprise in the 1940s, with staff in Mexico making collections of the crops they were tasked with improving for Mexican farmers. Around 1950 this initial maize collection began a slow transformation from being a working collection of Mexican maize varieties intended for use in the creation of better Mexican crops in the near future, to being the central repository for a global maize collection whose projected uses included maize breeders from around the world and especially the far future. And the Foundation did not stop at overseeing the world’s maize diversity. Where the staff of the Mexican program had begun maize collections without an initial vision for their ultimate extent, staff of newer crop improvement programs incorporated systematic collecting of regional and global diversity from the outset. In the late 1960s, longstanding concerns about the loss of genetic diversity began to be expressed with much greater urgency by many biologists and breeders. Confronting proposals for new international institutions and oversight to address this issue, Rockefeller Foundation officers presented the foundation as already well positioned to “complete” collections of genetic diversity in all the major economic crop plants and advanced the agricultural institutions they had founded as the ideal permanent international repositories for these collections. Here they had challengers, namely, FAO, which advanced itself as the organization best positioned to coordinate the international management of crop genetic resources. In the debates that followed, Rockefeller Foundation officers effectively positioned themselves and the institutions founded and funded by the foundation as better equipped than FAO, the designated UN body for agricultural concerns, to understand and take responsibility for the long-term (indeed, indefinite) maintenance of resources essential for international agricultural production. 
       The Rockefeller Foundation’s ever-expanding engagement with the genetic diversity of crop plants was not only a product of its officers’ growing sense of their own centrality in global agricultural production, present and future. It was also linked to a belief in the success of their own programs. Time and again they held up the work of their own employees and institutes as exemplars of collection and management of genetic material, even when they knew well that the established collections were vulnerable to disorder and decay. 
       The foundation’s faith in the success of its own programs can also be read into the shared belief of its administrators that they had so fundamentally transformed agricultural production that there was no hope for survival of genetically diverse varieties. This was a belief that was apparently shared among the agricultural research institutes as well, even as they became increasingly distinct from the foundation. As a document produced by a CIMMYT staff member in 1972 described, “CIMMYT, as one of the main architects of the so called ‘Green Revolution,’ has been responsible more than any other organization during the past five years for the displacement of local varieties and primitive cultivars of wheat and maize from their natural regions of cultivation and their replacement with higher yielding exotic varieties.” 41  Rockefeller Foundation staff were not embarrassed by their institutions’ implication in this perceived destruction of genetic resources and the risks to future agricultural production thought to be attendant upon it, but rather saw it as part of their established record of success. It was simply another reason for entrusting the future of the global diversity of crop plants to the foundation and the organizations it had played a central role in creating.

           Background 
           Enhanced recovery programmes improve outcomes in surgery, but their implementation after upper gastrointestinal resection has been limited. The aim of this study was to compare short-term outcomes for patients undergoing oesophagogastric surgery in an enhanced recovery programme (EROS). 
         
         
           Methods 
           EROS was developed after a multidisciplinary meeting by multiple rounds of revision. EROS was applied to all patients undergoing major upper GI resection at a university teaching hospital in the UK from 20/9/13, with data reviewed at 18/09/15. EROS was assessed to identify predictors for compliance. 
         
         
           Results 
           One hundred six patients underwent major upper GI resection including 81 oesophagectomies, 24 gastrectomies and 1 colonic interposition graft. Major complications (Clavien Dindo ≥3) occurred in 12 patients with 1 in-hospital death. Thirty-five patients (44%) were discharged on target day 8 of the EROS programme. Age and complications were independently associated with missing this discharge target. 
         
         
           Conclusion 
           Enhanced recovery is feasible and safe after major upper gastrointestinal surgery.

       Introduction 
       Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have proven benefits in mortality and morbidity in a range of settings. ERAS programmes reduce patient length of stay (LOS) and reduce costs. 1 – 3  The implementation of ERAS after upper gastrointestinal surgery has been limited by a number of factors. These include the historically high levels of mortality and morbidity after these types of operations and traditional surgical concerns regarding early feeding and anastomotic leak. The evidence for ERAS in oesophageal surgery is poor; in a recent systematic review, Findlay et al. identified only eight retrospective series with a total of 1127 patients. These were predominantly reports of single surgeon series and open resections. 4  In some units, one surgeon but not others have embraced ERAS for oesophageal surgery 5 , and in other units, only the fittest patients have been included, making the overall benefits hard to establish. 6 
 
       The use of minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) is gaining momentum in the UK with 43.2% of resections being either totally minimally invasive or hybrid operations (laparoscopic abdomen and open chest) in the latest national audit. 7  To date, very few reports have included patients treated with MIO within an enhanced recovery programme (ERP). The most recent systematic review and pooled analysis of enhanced recovery after oesophagectomy identified 27 cases of MIO in ERPs and 7 for MIO on conventional pathways. 8 
 
       Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop, introduce and analyse an enhanced recovery pathway for all patients undergoing upper GI resection, including open, hybrid and totally minimally invasive oesophagectomy. 
     
     
       Materials and Methods 
       
         Enhanced Recovery After Oesophagogastric Surgery (EROS) Programme Development 
         The EROS programme was developed and implemented at University Hospital Southampton (UHS) NHS Foundation Trust, a single centre teaching hospital in the UK and a designated centre for oesophageal and gastric cancer surgery. A draft EROS programme was proposed by the surgical team and subjected to multidisciplinary professional review at a dedicated EROS development day (25/01/2012). This event was attended by Dr Donald Low (Virginia Mason Medical Centre, Seattle), who provided detail of the well-established programme at his centre, on which the UHS EROS programme was based. 9  Multiple rounds of protocol revision were utilised to establish a programme that was considered as best practice and applicable to patients being treated in our centre by all key stakeholders (including surgeons, anaesthetists, specialist nurses, ward nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians and patients (Supplemental document  1 )). The fundamental components of the pathway involved pre, peri and post-operative elements including patient, carer and team expectation and education, preoperative carbohydrate loading, optimised anaesthesia, fluid and pain management, early and consistent mobilisation, timely removal of tubes and drains, early oral intake without the routine use of upper GI swallow studies and aggressive goal setting. Full details of the programme, including daily goals can be found in Supplemental document  2 . The programme was initially designed for all patients who underwent a primary operation including oesophageal anastomosis (oesophagectomy or total gastrectomy), but in practice was used for all patients who underwent major surgery (including sub-total gastrectomy). The programme also included a previously published risk prediction tool for anastomotic leak and major complications after oesophageal surgery. 10  The target time for discharge was set at post-operative day 8, with the goal of discharge to the patient’s home or usual place of residence without any increase in support. The EROS pathway was applied to all patients undergoing major oesophageal and gastric resections from 20/09/2013, with data presented up to 18/09/2015. There were no a priori exclusion criteria. Patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or stomach were staged and considered for neoadjuvant therapy based on established protocols and underwent surgery as previously described. 11 
 
       
       
         Outcome Measures 
         Data recorded included demographics, tumour characteristics, type of resection, operative times (defined as knife-to-skin to wound closure), estimated blood loss (calculated from suction bottles and weighed swabs), critical care unit stay, overall hospital stay (defined as day of surgery until day of discharge), histopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen, morbidity and mortality. TNM-7 was used to report tumour stage. Pathologic tumour clearance (‘R’ status) was determined according the Royal College of Pathologists system (&gt;1 mm clearance). Postoperative complications were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo classification 12  and were recorded for the entire inpatient stay. Clavien–Dindo grades I and II represent minor complications, whereas grades III and IV represent major complications (grade III requires radiologic endoscopic or surgical intervention; grade IV indicates life-threatening complication requiring intensive care management). An anastomotic leak (AL) was confirmed by radiology (contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT scan or water-soluble contrast studies), endoscopy or during surgical exploration. Elements of EROS were recorded to provide a comprehensive assessment of compliance covering all aspects of the enhanced recovery programme. 
       
       
         Statistics 
         Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS® version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). A  p  value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

         Demographics 
         The median age was 67 years with a male predominance (74% male versus 26% female). Patients who underwent gastrectomy were older (median age 71 versus 66 years for oesophagectomy). The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction and locally advanced disease (T3 in 56%) with lymph node metastasis (N1+ in 65%) on preoperative staging. Neoadjuvant therapy was used in 71% (chemotherapy in 49% and chemoradiotherapy in 24%). 
       
       
         Operative Outcomes 
         Operative outcomes for the whole cohort and specifically for oesophagectomy and gastrectomy are presented in Table  2 . There were 3 conversions to open procedures, all in the MIO group ( n  = 3/29 10%). The reasons for conversion were abdominal adhesions in 1 patient and in 2 patients the anaesthetist was unable to isolate the right lung at the beginning of the thoracic stage. Five operations required additional procedures, 2 lung resections (1 concurrent lung lesion of unknown aetiology and 1 concurrent primary lung cancer) and 3 splenectomy. Forty-eight patients (45%) had a feeding jejunostomy placed.

         A complete microscopic resection (R0) was achieved in 94 patients (89%), with a median lymph node yield of 24 (range 8–64). 
         Overall median length of stay was 9 days for all patients (range 4–90 days) and was 9 days for patients following oesophagectomy (range 6–90). All patients were discharged home (or to their usual place of residence) with no increase in the level of care provided except in 6 cases (5.6%) where increased support was required. Of these 6 patients, 4 experienced major complications and required readmission to intensive care (Clavien–Dindo grade 4). These patients had some of the longest lengths of stay. Of the other 2 patients, 1 had a pre-existing below-knee amputation and required a short-term increase in care and the other was an elderly man with no family support who suffered a post-operative chest infection. There was 1 in-hospital death (1%) at 59 days after a hybrid oesophagectomy. The patient died from multi-organ failure, after an anastomotic leak, having been treated preoperatively with high-dose steroids for concurrent lymphoma. There were three additional outpatient deaths: at 74 days after a hybrid oesophagectomy from rapidly progressive recurrent disease and at 88 and 89 days after palliative gastrectomy from disease progression; (90-day mortality: 4%). 
         Major complications (Clavien–Dindo; CD 3–4) occurred in 11 patients (11%). Anastomotic leak occurred in 5 patients (5%) and chyle leak in 8 patients (8%). Five patients (5%) required a return to theatre and 29 patients (27%) suffered respiratory complications, which were minor (CD &lt;3) in the majority (20 patients). Fifteen patients (14%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. 
         A detailed analysis for oesophagectomies only is presented in Supplementary Tables  5  and  6 . 
       
       
         EROS Pathway Compliance 
         Table  3  shows all major elements of the Southampton EROS pathway assessed for compliance. The EROS pathway documentation was missing for 16 patients and 10 patients were taken off the pathway due to major complications. The target discharge date of 8 days after surgery was achieved in 44% of patients. In total 61% of patients achieved mobilisation of at least 25 m on post-operative day (POD) 1, including 30% of patients who achieved compliance with the POD 1 target mobilisation of 2 × 25 m walks. Similar compliance rates were observed for POD 2–5. Oral intake of fluids was established on POD 4 in 60% of patients and pureed diet was established by POD 6 in 59%. Nasogastric tubes were removed in the majority on POD 2 (54%) and in no patients was reinsertion required.

         Predictors of Discharge by Postoperative Day 8 
         A binary logistic regression analysis identified increasing age and post-operative complications as factors independently associated with missing the predefined target of discharge on POD8 (Table  4 ). Other factors including operative approach, perioperative outcomes, tumour stage, ASA grade and EROS targets were not associated with this discharge target.

         Pre-EROS Experience 
         In the calendar year preceding the start of EROS, 72 consecutive patients underwent major upper GI resections (51 oesophagectomies). The overall median length of stay was 11 days (range 4 to 55 days) and 10 days for oesophagectomies (range 6 to 43 days). Major complications occurred in 18% and there were 3 deaths. 
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       This study demonstrated that EROS could be applied to all patients who underwent major upper GI surgery with good outcomes. Enhanced recovery was safe and effective after oesophageal surgery and delivered low levels of morbidity and short lengths of stay. 
       These findings are in line with results from other surgical disciplines. For instance, in colorectal surgery ERAS halves morbidity and significantly reduces length of stay. 13  Published results for enhanced recovery after oesophageal surgery have shown more modest improvements, possibly due to reluctance by the clinical teams to progress patients quickly for fear of significant, life-threatening complications. The findings of this study support the application of enhanced recovery for all upper GI patients undergoing major resection, with relatively aggressive targets. No major differences in outcome between different surgical approaches were observed, but the study was not designed to explicitly address this question. 
       The development of the EROS programme took into account the infrastructure and resources of the institute where it was introduced, meaning that it may not be applicable to different hospitals and healthcare systems. 14  This could also be considered as a benefit of the programme, as EROS contains the fundamental elements of enhanced recovery tailored to the local environment. Other centres wishing to introduce enhanced recovery can be reassured that adapting existing programmes for use in their own hospitals is possible and leads to good outcomes. Our experience with EROS suggests that the multidisciplinary team begin to see the programme as the default pathway for all patients undergoing major surgery. Anecdotally, mobilisation of all patients has improved and the “STEP” system (supplementary document  1 ) introduced for oral intake is now applied to all upper GI patients. This has the advantage of removing variation for the junior medical and nursing staff whose shift patterns change regularly. 
       The study had a number of strengths. The cohort was consistent with contemporary clinical practice; the majority of patients had locally invasive, node positive oesophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant therapy. The surgeons involved had significant experience with minimally invasive oesophagectomy 11  meaning that the applicability of the results for MIO have not been biased by a “learning-curve” effect. Morbidity data was comprehensively collected by a dedicated data manager and is reported using a validated system. 
       Overall outcomes are satisfactory and comparable with data from the UK National Oesophagogastric Cancer Audit (NOGCA) 7  and previously published series. 9  An improvement in overall length of stay was observed when compared to the year preceding the introduction of the programme (9 versus 11 days) and our previously published comparison of open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy (9 versus 12 days). 11  However, it is important to note that the benefit for oesophagectomies alone when comparing the EROS time period with the preceding year was only 1 day (9 versus 10 days). A potentially more clinically relevant improvement was observed for gastrectomies (7 versus 11 days), but the number of gastrectomies in the EROS cohort was modest ( n  = 24). 
       Whilst in this study, we have made no attempt to provide a detailed “before and after” analysis of EROS, major morbidity of 10% compares favourably with our experience (18%) in the year preceding the introduction of the programme and with other published series of oesophagectomies performed both on conventional care pathways and within ERPs. 5 ,  9 ,  11  Reduced morbidity for patients in EROS confirms previous reports from all branches of surgery and may represent the major benefit of enhanced recovery. This is particularly important for oesophageal surgery that has witnessed a dramatic reduction in mortality in recent years, but has struggled to make in-roads into relatively high complications rates. 7 
 
       A reduction in pulmonary complications has been reported as a significant benefit of both enhanced recovery and MIO. 15 ,  16  In this series, respiratory complications were observed in 27% of patients. This apparently high level of respiratory complications is in keeping with patients treated on a conventional pathway (29.1%) 8  but includes patients with relatively minor deviations to the clinical course (Clavien–Dindo 1 and 2) in the vast majority. When only major respiratory complications are considered, the incidence falls to 6.6%. 
       Considerable concern exists within the surgical community regarding gastric conduit decompression and the relevance of drainage procedures. No pyloroplasties or other drainage procedures were performed in this series and there were no instances of acute conduit distension. It appears feasible and safe to remove nasogastric tubes and recommence oral intake early in the post-operative course (POD 2) without the routine use of upper GI swallow studies. 
       We observed a significant number of readmissions within 30 days of discharge (14%). This may reflect an overly ambitious policy of discharge, but is also related to an “open-door” attitude towards discharged patients and the local geography (the catchment area includes the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands). Our experience suggests that rather than being viewed as a negative outcome, readmission should be expected in a relatively small proportion of patients as part of the enhanced recovery programme. Further community support for patients and their carers will be required to reduce readmissions and will be a focus for pathway development. 
       Reporting of compliance data in ERPs is poor 17  and patients with complications are often removed from ERPs. This makes it impossible to determine the efficacy of different aspects of the ERP and their relative effects on outcome. 14  In an attempt to address this, compliance with the major agreed components of EROS was documented and analysed. Age and complications defined by the Clavien–Dindo classification were independently associated with missing the predefined discharge target of 8 days. These factors may not be surprising but offer potential ways to improve the pathway. For example, patients of advanced age should be highlighted in the neoadjuvant or preoperative setting as potentially requiring prehabilitation interventions or increased packages of care to enable them to continue their rehabilitation, in the community. In addition, the focus should shift to preventing minor as well as major complications and this will require a whole multidisciplinary team approach. 
       In this study, compliance with target mobilisation was poor. However, this probably reflects overambitious target setting. The advantage of such target setting is that &gt;60% of patients walked &gt;25 m on POD 1 and an improvement in mobilisation quantity and distance was observed for each post-operative day. Consistent mobilisations early in the post-operative course proved labour intensive and difficult to achieve and we may have overestimated the availability of local resources to deliver this. Future efforts will be focussed on improving compliance in this area and will depend upon the continued development of the multidisciplinary team. 
     
     
       Conclusion 
       The experience described in this study with the introduction of EROS demonstrates that enhanced recovery is feasible and safe after major upper gastrointestinal surgery.

           Purpose of Review 
           There is considerable variability in human body weight, despite the ubiquity of the ‘obesogenic’ environment. Human body weight has a strong genetic basis and it has been hypothesised that genetic susceptibility to the environment explains variation in human body weight, with differences in appetite being implicated as the mediating mechanism; so-called ‘behavioural susceptibility theory’ (BST), first described by Professor Jane Wardle. This review summarises the evidence for the role of appetite as a mediator of genetic risk of obesity. 
         
         
           Recent Findings 
           Variation in appetitive traits is observable from infancy, drives early weight gain and is highly heritable in infancy and childhood. Obesity-related common genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies show associations with appetitive traits, and appetite mediates part of the observed association between genetic risk and adiposity. 
         
         
           Summary 
           Obesity results from an interaction between genetic susceptibility to overeating and exposure to an ‘obesogenic’ food environment.

       Introduction 
       A century ago, no more than 1 in 20 of the population were obese, the figure had risen to more than 1 in 10 by 1990, and currently it is 1 in 4 (Health Survey for England). Combining overweight and obesity together, almost three in four UK adults carry too much body fat (Health Survey for England) and one in three children (National Child Measurement Programme 2014/15). The rapid increases in weight are widely believed to have been caused by changes in lifestyle and the food supply, creating what is often called an ‘obesogenic’ environment. Changes in transportation and mechanisation have reduced the amount of energy expenditure required to perform a variety of tasks on a day-to-day basis [ 1 ]. At the same time, the range of sedentary screen-based entertainments has also increased, further reducing activity levels [ 1 ]. Developments in food production, processing, storage and preparation have resulted in highly palatable and energy-dense foods becoming more accessible and cheaper [ 2 ]. The food environment does not force us to overeat, but the opportunities and incentive structures have changed making it easy—consciously or unconsciously—to end up in positive energy imbalance, leading to weight gain. 
       However, despite the ubiquity of the ‘obesogenic’ environment, not everyone is overweight. Even within the same family, there can be striking differences between the weights of siblings living in the same household. It is clear that there is substantial variation in susceptibility to the ‘obesogenic’ environment, and the basis of this variation has been of great interest to obesity researchers. One hypothesis put forward is that differential susceptibility to obesity has a genetic basis, and excess weight gain arises from a combination of genetic risk  and  environmental exposure. Professor Jane Wardle developed the behavioural susceptibility theory (BST) to explain how this interaction between genetic risk and environmental exposure results in weight gain, proposing genetically determined differences in appetite as the mediating mechanism [ 3 ]. 
       BST has important implications for the prevention and management of obesity and public health policy. Genes set our potential for becoming obese, but the environment determines the outcome. George Bray put it well when he said: ‘Genes load the gun, and the environment pulls the trigger’ [ 4 ]. This review summarises evidence for gene-environment interplay in human body weight and the role of appetite as a mediator of genetic risk. The implications of BST for prevention, management and policy are discussed. 
     
     
       Gene-Environment Interplay in Human Body Weight 
       For over a century, researchers have studied twins to estimate the extent to which variability in human body weight is influenced by genes and the environment. Twin designs allow researchers to establish this because identical twins (monozygotic, MZs) are 100% genetically identical, while non-identical twins (dizygotic, DZs) share on average only 50% of their segregating genes, but importantly, both types of twins share their environments to a very similar extent (e.g. they are gestated in the same mother for the same period of time, grow up in the same household and are of the same socioeconomic status). Resemblance between both types of twins can therefore be compared to estimate genetic and environmental influence on body weight (or any other measured characteristic of interest). Greater similarity between the body weights of MZ versus DZ pairs indicates a genetic contribution to body weight. The statistic derived is ‘heritability’ which quantifies the proportion of variation in a trait (e.g. body weight) attributable to genetic variation and ranges from 0% (genetic variation plays no role in explaining variability in a trait) to 100% (genetic variation entirely explains variability in a trait). But twins also provide important insight into different sources of environmental influence, because aspects of environmental variation are partitioned out into those completely shared by two twins in a pair, contributing to within pair similarity (the ‘shared environment’, e.g. maternal gestational weight gain), and aspects that are unique to each individual twin, contributing to differences within pairs (the ‘non-shared environment’, e.g. illness). 
       Nearly a century of research with twins has established that human body weight (indexed using body mass index (BMI)) is highly heritable [ 5 ,  6 ], but heritability estimates vary considerably. In a review of 32 studies [ 7 ], the median heritability estimate was 73% but ranged from 32 [ 8 ] to 90% [ 9 ]. Gene-environment interplay seems to explain much of this variability. The review found that heritability estimates were higher in populations living in more ‘obesogenic’ environments characterised by those with a higher average BMI and those from countries with a higher average gross domestic product. Obesity prevalence tends to be higher in families of lower socioeconomic status (SES) in Western countries, making lower SES another marker of a more ‘obesogenic’ environment. A large longitudinal study of 16,646 Dutch twin pairs from 1 to 20 years of age found significantly higher genetic variance in BMI for children with less educated parents and lower genetic variance in children with better educated parents [ 10 ]. The modifying effect of SES on genetic variance in BMI has been replicated in adult populations, using their own education level [ 11 ,  12 ]. 
       Another way to capture exposure to the ‘obesogenic’ environment is to estimate the heritability of BMI at a particular age, by year-of-birth, the assumption being that those born later have spent a greater proportion of their life in a more ‘obesogenic’ environment. A large Swedish study of around 2000 twin pairs and 115,000 siblings born between 1951 and 1983 showed that genetic variance in BMI at age 18 was higher for those born later, and by implication living in a more ‘obesogenic’ environment [ 13 ]. Together, these findings suggest that genetic influence depends to some extent on environmental exposure—the more ‘obesogenic’ the environment, the greater the genetic influence on weight. 
       The Collaborative Project of Development of Anthropometrical Measures in Twins (CODATwins) is a large-scale initiative of pooled twin studies that includes 434,723 twin individuals (201,192 twin pairs) from 48 studies across 22 countries [ 14 ]. This study showed profound developmental variation in genetic influence, which increased from a moderate 40% at 4 years of age to 75% by 19 years of age [ 15 ]. At the same time, an important influence of the  shared  environment was observed in middle childhood, but decreased steadily with age (in parallel with increasing genetic risk) such that by 15 years of age, it had disappeared entirely. While it may seem counterintuitive for genetic influence to strengthen (and shared environmental influence to diminish) as children mature, the gain in independence means increasing exposure to the wider ‘obesogenic’ environment. This observation is consistent with a model of gene expression depending on environmental exposure. 
       The high heritability estimates observed for human body weight made it a promising phenotype for genome-wide association studies to identify common genetic variants contributing to variation. A variant in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) was the first to be discovered and has the largest effect size of all known variants to date [ 16 ]. Adults of average height who carry two copies of the high-risk variant (homozygotes) are approximately 3 kg heavier than adults who carry two copies of the low-risk variant. FTO was an important discovery, not only because about half of the population carries at least one of the high-risk variants, but also because the effect size was large enough for researchers to explore its mechanisms. Currently, 97 common variants have been robustly associated with body mass index (BMI) in genome-wide meta-analyses [ 17 ••]. These can be aggregated into a composite genetic risk score that is quantitatively associated with BMI, explaining approximately 3% of variation among adults and children. 
       As is observed with twin studies, the environment also modifies the impact of measured genetic risk of obesity. In a large European sample of children ( n  = 4406), low parental socioeconomic position accentuated the effect of FTO on adiposity [ 18 ], and in an adult sample, the higher risk variant of FTO was only associated with obesity risk in participants with no university education [ 19 ]. Age-related increases in the magnitude of the association between measured genetic risk of obesity (indexed using FTO and composite genetic risk scores) and BMI have also been observed [ 20 – 23 ], in line with patterns of heritability from twin data. The strongest evidence yet has come from a recent study showing that the association between measured genetic risk of obesity (using a composite score) and BMI was significantly larger for more recent birth cohorts, i.e. those with who had had greater overall exposure to the ‘obesogenic’ environment [ 24 ]. 
       Together, these studies provide convincing evidence that genetic risk of obesity depends on exposure to an ‘obesogenic’ environment. The question is  how  ‘obesogenic’ environments accentuate the effects of genes to maximise genetic expression. Jane Wardle proposed that the basis of the interaction is inherited differences in appetite, which make some individuals more likely to overeat in response to the many opportunities offered by the current food environment, so-called  behavioural susceptibility theory  (BST) [ 3 ]. 
     
     
       Behavioural Susceptibility Theory: Appetite Mediates Genetic Risk of Obesity 
       BST hypothesises that genes influence weight at least partly through their effects on appetite—i.e. there is variation in appetite that has a strong genetic basis, and variation in appetite causes differences in body weight. The idea that appetite plays a causal role in obesity is not new; it was first proposed by Stanley Schachter in 1968 [ 25 ]. In a series of innovative experiments, he observed that obese adults ate significantly more than healthy weight adults when the food on offer was highly palatable, but showed no difference in intake in response to bland foods. At the same time, obese adults did not show the same compensatory down-regulation of food intake following a high-calorie snack as normal-weight adults, indicating blunted satiety (fullness) or an overriding of satiety. Schachter came up with externality theory to explain these observations. He proposed that obese individuals have two distinct aberrations in appetite regulation that lead to overeating; they are overly responsive to highly palatable food cues (wanting to eat (or eat more) in response to the sight, smell and taste of palatable food) and are under-responsive to internal satiety mechanisms (fullness). 
       Wardle was the first to make the link between these appetitive characteristics identified by Schachter and genetic risk of obesity. She developed the BST in which she hypothesised that genes influence weight at least partly via biological mechanisms that control appetite regulation [ 26 ]. The BST explains how human body weight can have  both  genetic  and  environmental drivers at the same time and why genetic expression on weight is likely to be stronger in more ‘obesogenic’ environments (see Fig.  1 ). Individuals who are genetically predisposed to be highly responsive to food cues are more likely to overeat in an environment in which food cues pervade every aspect of daily living. Those predisposed to weaker satiety signals are more likely to overeat in response to larger portion sizes and multiple opportunities to eat.  Fig. 1   How appetite mediates the interaction between genetic susceptibility to obesity and environmental exposure. Individuals who inherit a set of genes that bestow greater responsiveness to external food cues and/or lower sensitivity to satiety are more likely to overeat in response to an ‘obesogenic’ food environment, and to gain excessive weight. Obesity therefore results from a combination of genetic susceptibility to overeating and exposure to an ‘obesogenic’ food environment    
 
       
         Development of Psychometric Measures of Appetite for Children 
         In order to test the BST, Wardle needed to measure these appetitive characteristics in samples large enough to establish reliable associations with weight, demonstrate generalisability and estimate genetic influence. Laboratory-based measures of appetite provide unparalleled detail, but the time and expense incurred prohibit measuring eating behaviour objectively in large samples. Another limitation is that only a single ‘snapshot’ of eating behaviour is captured, and behaviour is subject to any extraneous factors at play during the time of testing. The unfamiliar setting and not liking the test food can be particularly problematic. Wardle also saw limitations to studying the BST in adults and considerable advantages to undertaking research with infants and children. Adults with longstanding obesity may have abnormalities in appetite as a result of physiological changes caused by the excess weight itself, and overweight adults are often dieting. Young children are unlikely to be dieting and are too young to have experienced long-term effects of chronic obesity. Studying infants prospectively into childhood provides the opportunity to study the cause-effect relationship between appetite and weight as it starts to emerge. 
         Wardle therefore developed the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ), a comprehensive parent-report psychometric measure of a range of children’s appetitive characteristics, to test the BST in large samples of children [ 27 ]. While standardised psychometric measures lose the objectivity of laboratory-based observations, they have the advantage of characterising habitual eating behaviour over many meals and situations—in this respect, such measures capture the enduring appetitive ‘trait’ rather than a ‘state’ of hunger or fullness at the time of testing. Young children lack the comprehension skills or self-awareness to answer questions about their own behaviour, but parents tend to know them very well, arguably making them the most accurate informants of their children’s behaviour. Parent report is of course subjective and has the potential for bias, but the CEBQ has been validated against objectively measured eating behaviour [ 3 ]. 
         The CEBQ is a comprehensive measure of all observable aspects of children’s eating behaviour hypothesised to play a causal role in overweight or to protect against overweight. Parents respond to items that describe a range of eating behaviours using a five-point frequency scale (‘never’, ‘rarely’, ‘sometimes’, ‘often’, ‘always’) to indicate the frequency with which their child demonstrates each behaviour. Two scales characterise Schachter’s behavioural measures of responsivity to food cues and are hypothesised to predispose to overweight: ‘food responsiveness’ measures a child’s tendency to want to eat when prompted by palatable foods (e.g. ‘even if my child is full up, s/he finds room for his/her favourite food’), and ‘enjoyment of food’ captures the subjective reward experienced while eating (e.g. ‘my child enjoys eating’); higher scores on these scales indicate a more avid appetite. Two other scales characterise Schachter’s behavioural measures of responsivity to internal satiety cues and are hypothesised to protect against overweight: ‘satiety responsiveness’ measures a child’s fullness threshold (e.g. ‘my child gets full before his/her meal is finished’) and ‘slowness in eating’ captures the pace with which a child finishes a meal, with higher eating speed hypothesised to outpace biological satiety mechanisms (e.g. ‘my child takes more than 30 min to finish a meal’); higher scores on these scales indicate better appetitive control. Two scales measure the tendency to either under- or overeat in response to negative emotions: ‘emotional overeating’ is thought to predispose to overweight (e.g. ‘my child eats more when worried’), and ‘emotional undereating’ is hypothesised to protect against overweight (e.g. ‘my child eats less when upset’). ‘Food fussiness’ assesses the tendency for a child to be highly selective about what they will agree to eat and captures both refusal to try unfamiliar foods (termed ‘neophobia’, e.g. ‘my child refuses new foods at first’) as well as pickiness about the textures and tastes of familiar foods (e.g. ‘my child is difficult to please with meals’). Fussiness is a common characteristic of children who fail to thrive, because they often eat too little; this trait may therefore offer some protection against overweight. 
         The CEBQ scales have good internal and external reliability [ 27 ] and show strong tracking from early to late childhood [ 28 ] indicating that they characterise fairly stable traits that persist over development. The CEBQ has also been adapted to measure appetitive traits during infancy (the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, BEBQ [ 29 ]), and more recently in adulthood (the Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, AEBQ [ 30 ]). The BEBQ measures four of the same appetitive traits during the period of exclusive milk feeding, before any solid food has been introduced: ‘food responsiveness’, ‘enjoyment of food’, ‘satiety responsiveness’ and ‘slowness in eating’. The AEBQ is a self-report version of the CEBQ for adults, capturing largely the same appetitive traits as the CEBQ: ‘food responsiveness’, ‘enjoyment of food’, ‘satiety responsiveness’, ‘slowness in eating’, ‘emotional overeating’, ‘emotional undereating’ and ‘food fussiness’, but with the addition of a ‘hunger’ scale to capture experienced levels of hunger (arguably only possible via self-report) [ 29 ]. Together, these three measures enable assessment of eating behaviour across the life course from infancy (BEBQ) and childhood (CEBQ) into adulthood (AEBQ). 
         The development of these psychometric measures of appetite has led to the emergence of an extensive literature exploring the relationship between appetite and weight in large population-based samples, the genetic basis of appetite and the role of appetite in mediating genetic risk of obesity. The majority of research has focused on the scales that characterise the appetitive traits relating to Schachter’s externality theory, ‘food responsiveness’ and ‘enjoyment of food’ (indexing hyper-responsiveness to external food cues) and ‘satiety responsiveness and slowness in eating’ (indexing blunted responsiveness to internal satiety cues). 
       
       
         Variation in Appetitive Traits Drives Weight Gain 
         A wealth of cross-sectional research with the CEBQ has established almost without exception that ‘food responsiveness’ and ‘enjoyment of food’ are positively and ‘satiety sensitivity’ and ‘slowness in eating’ are negatively associated with measures of adiposity, in different samples of children ranging from 3 to 13 years of age [ 31 – 36 ]. Importantly, studies have also demonstrated that these appetitive traits influence weight across the whole spectrum in a graded fashion. They do not simply distinguish the clinically obese from the ‘healthy weight’ children, but explain more subtle variation in weight as well, e.g. between children at the lower versus higher end of ‘healthy weight’ [ 31 ,  32 ,  34 – 36 ]. 
         This research provides support for the BST insofar as greater adiposity is characterised by distinctive eating behaviours that predispose to overeating, but cross-sectional data cannot provide any insight into the direction of the relationship between appetite and weight. Establishing the cause-effect relationship is not a straightforward task. It is not possible to randomise individuals to be more or less food responsive or satiety sensitive, and then examine the impact on weight. An alternative approach is to use prospective data to establish if variation in appetite predicts weight gain better than variation in weight predicts appetite change. The BST also hypothesises that these appetitive traits, like body weight itself, have a genetic basis. 
         Wardle established a large population-based prospective birth cohort of 2402 infant twin pairs, Gemini [ 37 ], to explore genetic and environmental influence on early growth, with a focus on behavioural pathways. Two design features ensure that the Gemini cohort is well placed to examine the validity of the BST: (i) it is a prospective birth cohort allowing the direction of the relationship between appetite and weight to be tracked as it starts to emerge in early life and (ii) the twin design allows the genetic and environmental influence on appetite to be explored. 
         Gemini was the first study to examine the (bidirectional) prospective relationships between appetite and weight from birth. Data strongly supported the hypothesis that variation in appetite at 3 months was driving early weight gain from 3 to 15 months, not the other way around (weight variation at 3 months did not predict appetite change from 3 to 15 months) [ 38 ]. A follow-up study strengthened this finding, by comparing the growth trajectories from 3 to 15 months of twin pairs discordant for ‘food responsiveness’ ( n  = 121 pairs) and ‘satiety responsiveness’ ( n  = 172 pairs). This design enabled an investigation of the relationship between appetite and weight gain while controlling for important environmental confounders that are completely shared by twin pairs (e.g. maternal pre-pregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, maternal diet during pregnancy, SES). The weights of the twin pairs diverged progressively such that by 15 months of age, there was a 1-kg difference, equating to a 10% difference in body weight [ 39 ••]. The only subsequent prospective study of 210 infants from Singapore also found that higher ‘food responsiveness’ and lower ‘satiety responsiveness’ (and ‘slowness in eating’) were associated with greater infant weight gain [ 40 ]. 
       
       
         Appetitive Traits Mediate Genetic Influence on Weight 
         Using the BEBQ, Gemini has also established the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influence to variation in appetitive characteristics during the earliest period of life, when infants are still exclusively milk-fed [ 41 ]. Heritability was substantial for each of ‘enjoyment of food’ (53%), ‘food responsiveness’ (59%), ‘satiety responsiveness’ (72%) and ‘slowness in eating’ (84%). This finding is striking, given that the BEBQ captures variation in appetite for milk only—even very early in life infants vary considerably in their appetite, and this variation is both associated with weight gain and is genetically based. A follow-up study to quantify the extent to which there is genetic overlap between appetite and weight at 3 months found that approximately one third of the genetic influences underlying 3-month weight are the same as those underlying appetite, supporting the hypothesis that genes influence weight partly through effects on appetite [ 42 ]. 
         The infant study in Gemini followed only one previous examination of the heritability of ‘enjoyment of food’ and ‘satiety responsiveness’ in a very large population-based sample of 10-year-old twin children ( n  = 5435 pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), also conducted by Wardle [ 43 ]. The heritability estimates observed in older children were of the same magnitude as those observed in infancy for both ‘enjoyment of food’ (75%) and ‘satiety responsiveness’ (63%). Eating speed, measured objectively in a subsample of the children ( n  = 254), also showed high heritability (62%) [ 44 ]. 
         The recent discovery of common genetic variants associated with human body weight has opened up new avenues for detailed examinations of the mechanisms involved, and the likely role of appetite. Shortly after the discovery of FTO, Wardle and her colleagues [ 45 ] used data from TEDS to show that 10-year-old children who carried at least one copy of the lower risk variant (TT or AT) were significantly more satiety sensitive than those carrying two copies of the higher-risk version (AA). This effect remained after adjustment for BMI, indicating that FTO is influencing body weight via impacting satiety sensitivity. This study was replicated using a behavioural measure of satiety sensitivity in a subsample of the children at 5 years of age [ 46 ] and shown independently by Cecil and colleagues [ 47 ]. A more recent study [ 48 ••] showed that a composite genetic risk score both  with  and  without  FTO was associated with ‘satiety responsiveness’ in the TEDS children at 10 years of age, and mediated part of the association between the genetic risk score and adiposity, indicating that FTO  and  other variants are affecting adiposity partly via mechanisms that regulate satiety. 
         In three other large independent samples of adults ( n  = 4632,  n  = 1231 [ 49 ];  n  = 3852 [ 50 ]), questionnaire measures of ‘uncontrolled eating’ (a measure of extreme hunger and eating trigged by external food cues) and ‘emotional eating’ were also associated with genetic risk of obesity, and these appetitive traits mediated part of the association between the genetic risk score and adiposity [ 49 ]. Gene expression studies have also strongly supported an appetitive pathway insofar as many of the common risk variants are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, key sites of central appetite regulation [ 17 ••]. 
         The magnitudes of the associations between known obesity-related genetic variants and appetitive traits (and body weight itself) are often disappointingly small, but identifying the mechanisms is nevertheless an important endeavour. Establishing causal pathways can guide researchers towards targeted interventions to reduce obesity risk. The evidence for genetic risk of obesity operating (at least partly) via appetitive mechanisms suggests that behavioural processes may serve as useful intervention targets. 
       
       
         Behavioural Expressions of Appetitive Traits and Weight Gain 
         A key question of interest has been  how  these genetically determined appetitive traits lead to weight gain in response to the current ‘obesogenic’ environment. In other words, what are the  behavioural  expressions of these traits that lead to overeating and weight gain in an  everyday  context? Recent research in Gemini has established that greater responsiveness to food cues and blunted satiety sensitivity are characterised by distinctive (different) ‘everyday’ patterns of excess intake, in very young children. When the twins were approximately 2 years old, parents completed 3-day diet diaries for 2203 of the children [ 51 ]. These data were used to derive two possible patterns of overeating—consuming a larger average meal size at each eating occasion and eating more frequently throughout the day. Relationships between these intake patterns and appetite (‘food responsiveness’ and ‘satiety responsiveness’ measured using the CEBQ at 15 months) were explored. More food responsive children ate more frequently throughout the day but did not eat a larger amount each time [ 52 •]. On the other hand, children with impaired satiety sensitivity consumed larger average meal sizes each time they ate, but did not eat more frequently throughout the day [ 52 •]. These distinctive patterns of overconsumption make sense given what we know about the interaction between appetite and environmental opportunity. Individuals who are highly responsive to food cues are likely to eat more often in response to an environment where food cues are encountered throughout the day. Those with weaker satiety signals are susceptible to overeating in response to larger portion sizes, because they take longer to feel full (or require more energy or a larger sized portion (higher grams) of food). 
         Subsequent research showed that consuming larger average meal sizes, but not eating more frequently, was the key driver of excessive weight gain from 2 to 5 years of age. But it is important to understand the relative contribution of meal size and meal frequency to weight gain in older children who have more autonomy over how much  and  how often they eat [ 53 •]. 
       
     
     
       Conclusions 
       The BST has revolutionised our understanding of the genetic and environmental drivers of human body weight. It is clear that some individuals face a double onslaught of both biological and environmental pressures. Established psychometric measures have revealed that differences in food cue responsiveness and satiety sensitivity begin to emerge after birth and persist across the life-course. Variation in these appetitive traits has a strong genetic basis and impacts early weight gain profoundly. Research into the BST has shown that individuals who inherit a more avid appetite are more susceptible to taking advantage of the many temptations and opportunities offered by the ‘obesogenic’ food environment and to gain excessive weight as a consequence. The behavioural expressions of an avid appetite are eating too often throughout the day (greater food cue responsiveness) and eating too much each time (weakened satiety sensitivity). 
       BST points very strongly to the likelihood that obesity rates would diminish should the wider food environment change dramatically. The reality is that large-scale government regulation of the food supply is unlikely to happen in the near future, given that public support for making food less accessible, palatable or affordable would probably be low. In the meantime, the development of pharmacological and behavioural treatments that target over-responsiveness to food cues and impaired satiety might provide an avenue for success. Strategies such as careful portion control and slow eating are already used to circumvent poor satiety responsiveness, and there may be other opportunities to attenuate responsiveness to food cues, such as attention control or self-regulation training. 
       Given that variation in appetite is observable and measurable from early postnatal life, this might provide a useful marker of obesity risk for public health obesity prevention initiatives. Wardle’s work on the BST has also provided a firm conceptual framework for the development and testing of early life interventions to attenuate food cue responsiveness and upregulate satiety sensitivity.

           Background 
           Cell fixation is an essential step to preserve cell samples for a wide range of biological assays involving histochemical and cytochemical analysis. Paraformaldehyde (PFA) has been widely used as a cross-linking fixation agent. It has been empirically recognized in a gold standard protocol that the PFA concentration for cell fixation,  C 
 PFA , is 4%. However, it is still not quantitatively clear how the conventional protocol of  C 
 PFA  is optimized. 
         
         
           Methods 
           Here, we investigated the mechanical properties of cell fixation as a function of  C 
 PFA  by using atomic force microscopy and scanning ion conductance microscopy. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of  C 
 PFA  (0–10 wt%) on the morphological and mechanical properties of live and fixed mouse fibroblast cells. 
         
         
           Results 
           We found that both Young’s modulus,  E,  and the fluctuation amplitude of apical cell membrane,  a 
 m , were almost constant in a lower  C 
 PFA  (&lt;10 −4 %). Interestingly, in an intermediate  C 
 PFA  between 10 −1  and 4%,  E  dramatically increased whereas  a 
 m  abruptly decreased, indicating that entire cells begin to fix at  C 
 PFA  = ca. 10 −1 %. Moreover, these quantities were unchanged in a higher  C 
 PFA  (&gt;4%), indicating that the cell fixation is stabilized at  C 
 PFA  = ca. 4%, which is consistent with the empirical concentration of cell fixation optimized in biological protocols. 
         
         
           Conclusions 
           Taken together, these findings offer a deeper understanding of how varying PFA concentrations influence the mechanical properties of cells and suggest new avenues for establishing refined cell fixation protocols.

       Background 
       Understanding how cells behave at material interfaces holds wide importance for key biological applications such as cell–material surface interactions [ 1 ], mechanobiology [ 2 ], and advanced cell analysis [ 3 ]. Among such applications, one of the most practical and widely methods used across the biological sciences is cell fixation, which is an essential process for histological analyses in clinical diagnosis. Typically, when cells are degraded or dehydrated, essential cell components, such as protein, membrane, and intracellular structures will also be altered or degraded [ 4 ]. The surface structure of these cells may also collapse and diffuse away during antibody incubation and washing steps. Cell fixation aims to maintain cells or cellular components in life-like state, preventing unexpected changes by preserving essential chemical and physical characteristics of cells for further observation. Furthermore, cell fixation provides an effective approach for immunostaining by allowing the antibodies to access intracellular structures [ 5 ]. 
       Among various fixation agents for cross-linking cell membrane and cytoplasmic protein, paraformaldehyde (PFA) is one of the most widely used chemical agents for cell and tissue samples [ 4 – 6 ]. PFA causes covalent cross-links between molecules, effectively gluing them together into an insoluble meshwork that alters the mechanical properties of the cell surface. Previous studies report that the cell surface hardens after fixative treatment [ 7 – 10 ]. Compared to an unfixed cell, the mechanical properties of a fixed cell are more uniform across the entire cell surface [ 11 ]. However, there is no systematic assessment of correlation between changes in mechanical properties of live and fixed cells. Indeed, little is known about how the mechanical properties of cells depend on the PFA concentration. Furthermore, it has been revealed that subtle adjustment in fixation conditions with, e.g., PFA condition, can have dramatic effects on the immobilization of molecules within cellular membranes [ 12 ]. Understanding the detailed process of cell fixation in various states from living cells to completely fixed cells provides an opportunity to optimize cell fixation protocols and to gain useful knowledge about the living cell fixation process. 
       To address this outstanding question, we investigated the mechanical properties of cell surface structures as a function of the concentration of PFA ( C 
 PFA ) by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). These methods allow us to measure the elastic modulus and the surface fluctuation amplitude, respectively, of cells in both living and fixed states [ 13 – 16 ]. These measurement approaches can be applied to living cells to investigate cell mechanical changes in response to the PFA concentration,  C 
 PFA . We found that both cell stiffness and cell surface fluctuation underwent a transition around  C 
 PFA  = 10 −1 –4%, and these quantities were unchanged at a higher  C 
 PFA  (&gt;4%), indicating that the cell fixation is stabilized at  C 
 PFA  = ca. 4%, which is consistent with the empirical concentration of cell fixation optimized in biological protocols. 
     
     
       Results and discussion 
       
         Topographical imaging of live and fixed L929 cells with SICM 
         Figure  1 c, d show the topography of a single L929 cell imaged by SICM before and after treating with 4% PFA, which is the conventional PFA concentration for cell fixation. Whereas no clear difference between the untreated and treated cells was observed for the cell height, a small difference in cell shape was apparent. The live cell shows a maximum height of 2.5 µm (Fig.  1 e), and the corresponding height in the 4% PFA treated cell appears around 2.5 µm (Fig.  1 f). However, the PFA-treated cells are slightly shrunken so that the cell adhesive area and the cell volume were lower than those of the untreated cell, which is in good agreement with anecdotal observations in the biology field [ 17 ]. The measured cell area and volumes are 908.12 µm 2  and 774.11 µm 3  in the live cell and 876.85 µm 2  (3.5% lower) and 716.54 µm 3  (7.4% lower) in 4% PFA treated cell. Furthermore, we found that the roughness of cell surface is larger in treated cells. This is probably due to crosslinking of proteins that react with PFA, resulting in aggregation and cell shrinkage.  Fig. 1   Schematic view of principle of SPM techiques and L929 cell surface images using SICM.  a  In AFM, the attractive or repulsive force between the tip and the sample causes deflection of the cantilever. As the cantilever deflects, the angle of the reflected laser beam changes angle and strikes a different part of the photodiode. The signals from the four quadrants of the detector are compared to calculate the deflection signal. Using this signal, the system (computer) generates a topography of the sample surface.  b  In SICM, a nano-pipette filled with electrolyte is brought in proximity to the sample of interest. A bias applied between an electrode in the pipette and another electrode in the bulk solution generates an ion current, which can be used in feedback control to prevent direct contact between the nano-pipette and the sample.  c  Height image and 3-dimensional image of live single L929 fibroblast cell surface using SICM hopping mode,  d  height image and 3-dimensional image of fixed fibroblast cell surface. The size of all images are 50 × 50 µm, after imaging of live cell ( c ), fixed with PFA, fixed cell imaging ( d ) was performed.  e ,  f  Indicates line profile of each image. Imaging time of each image is around 30 min    
 
       
       
         Surface fluctuations of cells with PFA treatment 
         We measured the I–D curves of SICM as applied to cell surfaces at various  C 
 PFA . To estimate cell surface fluctuations, the measurement time of the I–D curve was checked against a known standard [ 16 ,  18 ,  19 ]. Figure  2 b shows the representative I–D curves for L929 cells with different C PFA ’s. In the solid substrate (petri dish), I–D curve exhibits the steepest slope, while in the untreated condition, I–D curve exhibits the broadest slope. In the PFA-treastd cells, the I–D curves exists in between. Note that the cell treated with 4% PFA was almost the same I–D curve as the solid substrate I–D curves. The I–D curves in Fig.  2 b were fitted to Eq. ( 1 ), and the RMS displacement of cell surface fluctuations on treatment of different  C 
 PFA  are shown in Fig.  3 . The estimated RMS displacement of surface fluctuations (a m ) is approximately 12 nm on the 4% C PFA  treated cell. However, it increases gradually depending on the lower concentration of PFA. In the live cell, displacements was around 43 nm. The chemically fixation caused no difference on cell surface topography (Fig.  1 e, f) however, the surface dynamics was drastically varied. It means that the live L929 cell had more active movement compare to the PFA treated cell. Smaller surface fluctuations in PFA treated cell can be explained by the PFA treatment effect that results in cross-linking of proteins between the membrane and cytoplasmic proteins.  Fig. 2

To investigate fluctuation levels, the nano-pipette was positioned on the apex of the single cell.  b  Typical ion current–distance curves of the solid substrate ( black ), a fixed cell ( red ), a 1% PFA treated cell ( green ), a 0.1% PFA treated cell ( blue ) and a live cell ( sky blue ). For the solid substrate (petri dish), there was no change. In the fixed cell, a much broader curve range was observed. For the live cell, the broadness of the curve range was greatest    
  Fig. 3   RMS displacements of cell surface fluctuations. The displacements are approximately 12 nm on a fixed cell, but much larger on a live cell surface (43 nm). The live cell shows more active movement than fixed cell (N = 60)    
 
       
       
         Young’s modulus of cells with PFA treatment 
         To investigate the effect of PFA treatment on cell surface stiffness, the force-separation curve measurements were performed on live and PFA treated cells (Fig.  4 a). Figure  4 b shows typical force-separation curve for live cells, 4% PFA treated cells and solid substrate (petri dish). Clearly, the 4% PFA treated cell exhibits a much steeper force curve slope than a live cell. In addition, the required force for surface indentation is also larger for treated cells than for live cells. Figure  5  shows the averaged Young’s modulus,  E , values as a function of C PFA . Compared to live cells (3.5 kPa), the stiffness of PFA treated cells (4%  C 
 PFA  treated cell is 18 kPa) gradually increases with higher  C 
 PFA .  Fig. 4

Compared to live cells, the slope of fixed cells approach curve is steeper, indicating a significantly larger Young’s modulus for fixed cells    
  Fig. 5   Young’s modulus for varying PFA concentrations in fibroblast cells. As expected, higher concentrations resulted in a higher Young’s modulus: approximately 3.5 kPa on live cells, and 18 kPa on fixed cells (N = 50)    
 
         The cell stiffness measured with AFM is strongly affected by the actin filamentous structures. PFA treatment affects the cross-linking of cell surface proteins, including F-actin filaments [ 5 ,  9 ,  17 ,  20 ,  21 ]. Taken together, we concluded that the stiffening of cells directly results in the cross-linking of proteins. Specifically, it is assumed that the PFA fixation caused an increase of the cell stiffness depending on the available number of randomly distributed crosslinking sites on the cell surface. As shown in Fig.  5 , Young’s modulus does not increase linearly with the  C 
 PFA  which suggests saturation in the number of available sites for surface protein cross-linking. Below the 10 −1 % of  C 
 PFA  treatment, in lower concentration, there is no significant effect on cell stiffness, but it gradually increases because the crosslinking is occurred randomly. In the intermediate C PFA  (10 −1 %), a percolation of the crosslinking occurs, so that the stiffness undergoes a transition. When treated with higher concentrations of PFA (over 10 −1 %), it produces dramatic changes in cell stiffness. In this case, the stiffness remains unchanged, indicating the percolation is completed around C PFA  = 4%. Interestingly, the elastic modulus begins to increase before the membrane fluctuation amplitude decreases, suggesting that cells can tolerate some degree of protein cross-linking while maintaining normal function. Such findings are in excellent agreement with previous observations that molecules in cellular membranes can remain mobile under certain, relatively mild PFA fixation conditions [ 12 ]. 
         To corroborate these findings, cell viability experiments were conducted at different PFA concentrations. Figure  6 a shows live and dead cells as distinguished via the staining kit. Green color represents live cells, and red color represents dead cells. As shown in this figure, from control to 0.1% PFA treatment, most of the cell culture is live. PFA treatment over 1% shows a large increase in red cells, indicating widespread cell death. Also, Fig.  6 b shows the quantitative analysis of live and dead ratio from staining data after PFA treatment. Between 0.1 and 1%  C 
 PFA  appears to be the critical concentration for live cell to dead cell ratio inversion. This agreement between cell surface fluctuation, Young’s modulus and cell viability assay data supports the statement that range encompassing 0.1–1%  C 
 PFA  can trigger sufficient surface protein cross-linking, and in particular that a critical density of cross-linking events occurs in this PFA concentration range whereby cellular function is irreversibly impaired and likely related to changes in membrane mobility as well. In other words, this PFA concentration range is critical for to influencing the available number of crosslinking sites on the cell surface, and with that, cell viability.

       Conclusions 
       Herein, we have demonstrated a fundamental mechanical comparison between live cells and cells that were fixed with various concentrations of PFA. AFM and SICM measurements showed that the apparent surface fluctuation amplitude and elastic modulus of cells underwent transition when exposed to PFA concentrations between 0.1 and 4%. After complete PFA fixation, cell surface fluctuation decreased to 71% of live cell, while the Young’s modulus increased by fivefold compared to that of live cells. These results provide a deeper understanding of how cells react to chemical treatment with PFA that takes into account not only the traditional chemical understanding of PFA’s effect upon the cell, but now also the cell’s surface-based mechanical properties that were targeted in this study. It is now apparent that PFA fixation enables the opening of distributed proteins across the cell surface, a critical process that facilitates widespread crosslinking. Cell membranes that are typically flexible and variable. But in a certain situation, such as chemical treatment, biological functions are changed, and morphological changes also occur. This is the reason why studying cell surface fluctuations are crucial for the understanding of cell function about cell dynamics. Given the general nature of these physicochemical mechanisms, we expect that similar effects of PFA treatment on the elastic modulus and membrane fluctuations would also be expected although the specific magnitudes and responses conferred upon PFA treatment might vary on an absolute scale. We have confidence in that the SPM techniques could well serve as a promising tool for quantitative studies of both fixed cells and live cells in order to further explore this exciting topic at the convergence of biology and nanotechnology. 
     
     
       Methods 
       
         Cell sample 
         We used mouse fibroblast L929 cells (ATCC, USA) cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Life Technique, US) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technique, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . The cell samples with cell densities of 1 × 10 4 /mL on a 35 mm diameter cell culture petri dish (NUNC, Denmark), were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, US) three times and then treated with different PFA solutions ( C 
 PFA  = 10 −5 , 10 −4 , 10 −1 , 1, 4, 8 and 10%) for 5 min. Before AFM and SICM experiments, the treated cell samples were again washed three times with PBS. 
       
       
         SPM apparatus 
         A commercial SPM system (NX-Bio, Park Systems, South Korea) equipped with an inverted optical microscopy (Nikon Corp., Japan) which is designed specifically for biological applications was employed in this study. The SPM system not only achieved a soft material sample such as cell surface information using SICM, but it also obtained mechanical properties of a sample using AFM. All experiments using live cells were performed in a customized live cell chamber (Live Cell Instrument, South Korea). The live cell chamber was adjusted to 37 °C with 5% CO 2  and 95% humidity, readily providing the specific environmental conditions needed to sustain cell cultures. Within this environment, live cell SICM imaging or AFM experiment was conducted for extended timeframes via optical monitoring methods, including optical phase contrast and digital image correlation microscopy. 
         
           SICM measurement for cell imaging and fluctuation analysis 
           The operation of SICM relies on an ion current that flows between an electrode inside a nano-pipette and an electrode located in an external bath solution. This ion current provides a feedback signal used to maintain the tip-sample distance and allow for the nano-pipette to scan topographical information (Fig.  1 b). In spite of low lateral resolution (10–20 nm) [ 22 ], SICM offers useful topographical measurement without applying any mechanical force onto the sample surface. 
           SICM imaging and ion current-distance (I–D) curve experiments were performed using customized SPM system with 100 nm inner diameter nano-pipette fabricated from borosilicate capillaries (inner diameter 0.6 mm, outer diameter 1.0 mm, World Precision Instruments, USA) using a CO 2 -laser pipette puller (Sutter Instruments, USA). The cell topographic images were obtained with the so-called hopping mode [ 23 ], in which the nano-pipette approached sample surfaces with the pre-set threshold of 1.2%. 
           The apparent fluctuation amplitude of cell apical surfaces,  a 
 m , was estimated from the I–D curve of SICM measurement [ 16 ,  19 ]. The measured ion current with cell apical surface fluctuation was assumed to be a convolution of the non-fluctuation-based ion-current relation,  I 
 0 , and the existing probability of cell surface position at z,  P ( z ).  1   \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

           AFM measurements for Young’s modulus of cells 
           The force curve measurements of AFM were performed to estimate Young’s modulus of cells. We used a commercial AFM cantilever (Biolever mini, Olympus, Japan) with less than 0.09 N/m of a nominal spring constant. Because a cantilever with a small spring constant makes a relatively large deflection for a small force, the cantilever used in this study provides reliable data of the cell surface structure. The spring constant of the AFM cantilever was calibrated using the thermal vibration method [ 24 ]. AFM cantilever was cleaned using ethanol and exposed to UV light for 30 min to remove contamination on the AFM cantilever and tip. We measured more than 50 force curves with 512 data points. The force curves were analyzed with a Hertz model using a commercial SPM data analysis program (Park Systems, South Korea). We assumed the AFM tip shape is four-sided pyramid with a half cone angle  α , so that the force on cantilever  F  is expressed as.  4   \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The scan rate of the AFM cantilever and the maximum loading force were set to be 1–2 µm/s and 3–8 nN, respectively. 
         
       
       
         Cell viability assay 
         To evaluate the viability of cells with PFA treatment, we used a LIVE/DEAD ®  Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (L3224; Invitrogen life technique, USA). Briefly, the PFA-treated cells were immediately incubated using the live and dead stain fluorescence dye for 10 min. Then the final 2 µM calcein AM and 4uM EtD-1 mixture solution were added to the PFA-treated cell sample. A commercial fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corp., Japan) was used to obtain fluorescence images of cells where green and red colors represented live and dead cells, respectively.

         Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are at a very high risk of developing early onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to trisomy of chromosome 21. AD is preceded by a prolonged prodromal “pre-clinical” phase presenting with clinical features that do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for AD. It is important to clinically characterise this prodromal stage to help early detection of the disease as neuropathology of AD is almost universal by the fifth decade in DS. There is a lack of knowledge of the trajectory of decline associated with the onset of dementia in this population and early signs may be overlooked or misdiagnosed, negatively affecting the quality of life of those affected and the use of early pharmacological or psychosocial interventions. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the published literature on longitudinal data in order to identify the cognitive and behavioural changes occurring during the prodromal and early stages of AD in this population. Fifteen peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria, including a total number of 831 participants, with the duration between baseline and follow up varying from 1 year to 47 years. Results suggest that, compared to the general population for which short-term (episodic) memory loss is the most common indicator associated with the onset of AD, in people with DS, executive dysfunction and Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are commonly observed during pre-clinical and early stages and may precede memory loss. The review highlights the importance of using a broad spectrum of assessments in the context of heterogeneity of symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, as well as the need for further research.

       Background 
       Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized histopathologically by neuronal death, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and clinically by a progressive and irreversible deterioration in cognition and behaviour (McKhann et al.  2011 ). The greatest prevalence of early onset AD is found in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS), with symptoms appearing before the age of 65 (Hartley et al.  2014 ) and approximately three-quarters of people with DS over 60 showing clinical evidence of dementia (Lai and Williams  1989 ). As the life expectancy of people with DS has increased from an estimated mean of 12 years in 1940, to over 60 years now (Bittles and Glasson  2004 ), the focus of research and of clinical services now includes adulthood and later life. 
       The later stages of AD in people with DS have been documented and are reportedly similar to symptoms exhibited by people with AD in the general population (Strydom et al.  2010 ). However, limited information is available with regards to cognitive and behavioural changes prior to diagnosis or during the very early stages (Adams and Oliver  2010 ). While in the general population the prodromic stage of AD is characterized by impairments in episodic memory, a number of qualitative studies involving people with DS have suggested that the progression of AD in people with DS (DSAD) might be more similar to dementia of the frontal type in the typically developing population, with Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) and impairment of executive functions (i.e. goal directed behaviours such as planning, attention, judgement etc.) preceding memory impairments (Deb et al.  2007 ). 
       Previous research has also indicated that carers often lack basic knowledge regarding the risk for dementia in this population and are not aware of the symptoms that they should be vigilant for in ageing individuals (Bittles and Glasson  2004 ). The present paper aims to address this gap in the literature and we report findings from a systematic review of the trajectory of changes that accompany the onset of dementia in this population (i.e. before the formal diagnostic criteria of AD are fulfilled). If there is evidence for an atypical presentation of dementia, such as BPSD and executive dysfunction preceding the development of sufficient symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria of dementia, this might partially account for the discrepancy between the almost universal presence of neuropathology from age 40 years onwards and the lower (than expected) prevalence rates for clinically diagnosed dementia (Ball et al.  2006 ) given the prevalence rate of neuropathology. Identifying symptoms that characterize pre-clinical and early AD in people with DS is necessary before further research and clinical interventions, which link findings from neuropathology, putative biomarkers or neuroimaging (Annus et al.  2015 ) with cognitive features, can be undertaken. Lastly, as new pharmaceutical therapies are developed it is necessary to have reliable measures of performance in all relevant outcome domains so that effectiveness of treatments can be evaluated. 
     
     
       Methods 
       A systematic review was undertaken following the guidelines provided by PRISMA (i.e. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses:  http://www.prisma-statement.org/ ) and the Cochrane Collaboration ( http://www.cochrane.org/ ). Potentially relevant studies were identified through searches in citation indexing databases: PubMed (Medline) and PsycInfo, as it has been suggested that they provide broad coverage of biomedical publications worldwide (Suarez-Almazor et al.  2000 ). Within the electronic database, the search was limited to peer-reviewed journals published between 2000 and 21.01.2015 and included the following terms ((“Down syndrome”[Title/Abstract] OR “Down”s syndrome”[Title/Abstract])) AND (“Alzheimer”[Title/Abstract] OR “Alzheimer”s”[Title/Abstract] OR “dementia”[Title/Abstract]). The search delivered 1267 results and reference lists of selected papers were also searched for potentially relevant studies (Fig.  1 ).  Fig. 1   Flow chart showing the process of selecting studies to be included in systematic review    
 
       Titles and abstracts, and then full text articles were reviewed to identify and exclude studies that did not satisfy the previously established criteria: (a) empirical papers, (b)  n  &gt; 1 (c) specified diagnosis of DS, and (d) specific reference to the clinical presentation of early stages of DSAD. Longitudinal studies were chosen as this type of study overcomes the issue of cohort effects and allows a better understanding of the dynamic process of cognitive and behavioural change. To minimize bias, the first author discussed the eligibility and validity of included studies with another member of the research team (AJH), solving any disagreement by consensus. 
       Moreover, as authors of the included studies have used a large variety of terms to refer to the same concept (i.e. “personality changes”, “behavioural change”, “behavioural excesses and deficits”, “maladaptive behaviour”), we will be using the umbrella term Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) in order to enhance the overall consistency of the paper. 
     
     
       Results 
       In total, 15 papers reporting on 15 longitudinal studies were selected for data extraction and analysis. Data was collected following guidelines set by the Cochrane Collaboration, with the following variables being extracted: study length, participant number and age at each assessment (mean and standard deviation, if recorded), dementia diagnosis, assessment measures and reported progression of symptoms. In cases where the longitudinal aspect was part of a larger cross-sectional study, data were included only from participants for which at least 2 data points were available. Summary statistics (mean ages and percentages) were calculated where they were not explicitly stated by authors. The duration between baseline and follow up varied from 1 year to 47 years and included a total of 831 participants. 
       A brief analysis of bias was conducted on the included studies by examining the degree to which the sampling frame is representative of the general population and whether the assessment tools have been validated, as well as the response proportion at both baseline and follow up, with minimal risks of bias being identified by the authors.

       It is also worth mentioning that some of the included studies have overlapping authors (e.g. Kitler et al.  2006 ; Krinsky-McHale et al.  2002 ; Devenny et al.  2000 ; Urv et al.  2008 ; and Ball et al.  2006 ; Holland et al.  2000 ) and since these are longitudinal studies conducted during the same time period, it is likely that some participants overlap within each group, which might impact the overall review. 
       For each study the following specific aspects were considered: first, evidence for change between time points in scores on cognitive functioning and, secondly, the reported BPSD identified as part of the diagnostic assessment. Where possible, the relationship between these observed changes over time was evaluated. Considering that the length of follow-up, diagnosis reports and assessment methods varied considerably (8 methods of diagnosing dementia, 10 memory tests, 21 instruments for assessing executive dysfunction and 10 measures of behaviour change (Table  2 ), the results are described through a qualitative synthesis rather than a meta-analysis.

         Presentation and Progression of Dementia in the People with DS 
         In the general population, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as the prodromal stage of dementia, but it has been argued that, in the case of people with DS, the exact hierarchy of loss of function is very difficult to establish (Cosgrave et al.  2000 ). Out of the 15 studies identified here, which attempted to address this question, nine suggested that ‘frontal-like symptoms’ were the earliest sign of AD in this population. Only two studies reported memory as the earliest sign of dementia. Out of the remaining four studies, two reported no decline that could not be accounted for by normal ageing and two did not report the order in which domains of cognitive functioning were affected. 
         The studies reporting the progression of clinical signs of DSAD are summarized in Table  3  and further discussed in the following sections. It is important to note that the majority of studies included in this review (with the exception of Määttä et al.  2014 ) have used various screening tools, rather than a diagnosis made by a clinician. Thus, it is possible that discrepancies between results are due to inadequate classification of participants with or without dementia, as well as due to the use of different diagnostic methods in each individual study (Ballard et al.  2016 ).

         Memory 
         DS is known be associated with impairments in working memory, specifically remembering information for short periods of time (Silverman  2007 ). It has been suggested that tasks that rely on the hippocampus (e.g. associations of items in space and time) are commonly impaired in this population, hence making difficult the measurement of decline in these domains as a marker of AD-related change. By taking into account the level of baseline functioning, researchers interested in memory decline in people with DS have mostly focused on verbal list learning and scene learning (Sabbagh and Edgin  2016 ). 
         Compared to the general population where episodic memory impairments characterize prodromal stages of AD in the majority of cases, only two of the longitudinal studies included in this review identified impairments in memory as one of the earliest symptoms of DSAD (Krinsky-McHale et al.  2002 ; Cosgrave et al.  2000 ). Krinsky-McHale et al. ( 2002 ) found that decline in memory function scores preceded the onset of global changes associated by the authors with the onset of dementia, as reported in informant interviews. Decline in memory function preceded more global changes by more than a full year and in some cases by up to 3 years. More specifically, verbal explicit memory was one of the first domains that were affected, with individuals’ scores on the Selective Reminding Test declining by 20% on two consecutive test sessions, The authors compared the results of participants with dementia to those of age- and IQ-matched non-demented individuals with DS and concluded that the dramatic declines observed in DSAD were distinguishable from normal ageing pattern. Interestingly, even in cases where participants were capable of performing the task, those in the early stages of dementia showed deficits in their capacity to encode and retrieve information from long-term memory. 
         This view was supported by a previous study in which memory loss was one of the first identifiable hallmarks of AD in an all-female sample of older adults with DS (Cosgrave et al.  2000 ). In this study, participants had difficulty remembering items that they had seen as part of a previous task (i.e. delayed memory) and difficulty remembering in which hand a paper clip was held by the examiner after both hands were placed behind the examiner’s back (i.e. immediate memory). 
         However, these findings were only applicable in the case of individuals with mild (IQ 55–70) and moderate ID (IQ 40–55), and memory problems were more difficult to identify in participants with more severe intellectual disabilities (severe = IQ 25–40, or profound = IQ &lt; 25) due to floor effects on established tests. More specifically, participants with IQ under 40 had very low scores on memory tests regardless of dementia diagnosis and thus, these measures may not be suitable as an indicator of decline over time in this population. More recently, in the DSM-V, IQ test scores have been removed from the diagnostic criteria of ID (American Psychiatric Association  2013 ), emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive assessment in which severity of ID will be based on the level of adaptive functioning, rather than IQ, as the former determines the level of support required (Oakley et al.  2003 ). 
         In the study conducted by Devenny et al. ( 2000 ), authors suggested that decline does not occur globally but rather as a systematic and progressive loss of cognitive functions, with memory loss being a predominant symptom in all participants who also showed decline on the Block Design and Coding subtests of the WISC-R. These participants were classified as having “questionable decline”. However, the authors emphasize the fact that none of these participants had received an official diagnosis from a physician and thus advise caution when interpreting their results, as it is possible that the observed declines were related to some other undetected condition. 
         A different view, however, is that decline in memory scores (even in the presence of developmental memory impairment) are observed in all ageing individuals with DS, regardless of dementia status (Ball et al.  2006 ; Devenny et al.  2000 ; Carr and Collins  2014 ). It is possible that by examining alternative measures of decline in other cognitive domains, the generalized pattern of deterioration that accompanies old age can be distinguished from preclinical AD. In the study conducted by Ball et al. ( 2006 ), informant reported memory changes were not correlated with subsequent diagnosis of AD and all participants who showed changes in memory also showed BPSD. However, in people with DS, early changes in memory may be more difficult to notice compared to BPSD, the latter having a greater impact on the individual’s daily life (Adams and Oliver  2010 ). Certain learning and memory tasks such as cued-learning and recall tasks may prove to be of a greater sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between AD and non-AD in this population (Benejam et al.  2015 ). 
         More recently, a review by Sabbagh and Edgin ( 2016 ), suggested that the earliest symptoms of dementia in individuals with DS are often subtle but are firstly evident in BPSD rather than episodic memory. They are thus arguing that the late diagnosis of DSAD is often due to the fact that current classification systems have their emphasis on memory impairments, having been modelled after the diagnostic criteria of dementia in the general population and are unfit for use in the DS population (Nieuwenhuis-Mark  2009 ). 
       
       
         Executive Function and Language 
         Functional impairments in executive functioning (executive dysfunction), as referring to informant reported difficulties with various goal-directed behaviours, such as planning and attention, and also performance on specific cognitive tests, have been identified in the majority of selected studies as preceding memory problems in adults with DS. However, in the studies reviewed there was not obvious overlap in terms of specific areas of decline identifed by repective authors. In Ball et al. ( 2006 ), the most commonly reported changes were impairments in planning, attention and lack of foresight, while in another study (Adams and Oliver  2010 ), the most affected areas were working memory, agnosia, aphasia and apraxia, with cognitive deterioration not being solely attributable to memory issues. In the Ball et al. ( 2006 ) paper, a version of the CAMCOG neuropsychological test battery modified for use with people with DS was completed at baseline and follow up assessments, to provide a measure of decline in global cognitive function. To provide more specific information on the sequence of decline in “frontal lobe associated EF” over the 5 years prior to diagnosis, an additional measure labelled “EF and attention” was designed by combining CAMCOG scores for abstract thinking, attention-calculation, verbal fluency and the clock drawing item. However, impairments in planning and foresight were measured through informant reported changes, rather than a more objective measure. Given the variety of living situations of participants in this study [i.e. residential homes (82%), sheltered accommodation (4%), nursing homes (2%), with a parent orrelative (13%)], we advise caution when interpreting these results. The caution is based on research showing that informant reports differ both qualitatively and quantitatively when recorded from personnel in an institution compared to parents (Nieuwenhuis-Mark  2009 ). Moreover, it is possible that “lack of foresight” could be affected by intellectual ability and this should also be taken into consideration, as 41 out of 55 participants in this study had moderate or severe learning disability. 
         In one of the studies, executive dysfunction was investigated by looking at verbal intrusions as an indicator of disruption of inhibition control (Kitler et al.  2006 ). Responding with an irrelevant word during a task of verbal memory retrieval was found to be predictive of performance on two out of three memory tasks administered within the next three years. Therefore, the authors argued that verbal intrusions are an early sign of Alzheimer-related neuropathology, preceding declines in memory. Interestingly, middle aged participants with DS made more verbal intrusions at baseline compared to participants with unspecified ID (74% vs 44%), giving further support to the idea that executive functioning is more sensitive to decline in DS than in other populations. 
         Another component of EF was examined by Nelson et al. ( 2007 ), who identified the NBAP Pragnosia scale as useful in classifying 80% of all dementia cases. The authors argued that impaired pragmatic language function represents an aspect of cognitive decline, as this measure appears to be strongly correlated with the assessment of dementia status (DMR Cognitive Scale). These impairments appeared to be most common in younger subjects, suggesting decline in functions other than memory, early in the course of dementia. More recently however, researchers have argued that verbal scores do not show significant decrease over the course of 47 years (Carr and Collins  2014 ), but these results might represent a sample bias, as the stronger representation of verbally able women might have influenced the overall stability of verbal scores in the group. 
         However, the exact sequence in which subdomains of executive functioning are affected has not yet been established. This could be largely due to the heterogeneity of DS phenotypes. Devenny et al. ( 2000 ) attempted to answer this question by following up participants over a 10 year period and noting that scores which showed decline early in the disease process were those that required perception of abstract stimuli and visuo-motor coordination. As participants progressed from prodromal stages to early dementia, deficits in comprehension, measures of visuospatial organization and the working memory component of language were observed, followed by vocabulary, information and digit span tasks in the middle stages of AD. As decline associated with the development of AD seems to involve progressively more areas of cognition and the number of areas in which decline was observed of was correlated to the severity of dementia, the authors conclude that cognitive decline in AD in people with DS is not global, but follows a predictable sequence. Executive functioning seems, according to the evidence presented above, to be affected in pre-clinical or early stages of AD and thus, detecting these changes could prove to be helpful in predicting a later diagnosis of AD. 
       
       
         Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) 
         Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) have been defined as a “heterogeneous range of psychological reactions, psychiatrics symptoms and behaviours resulting from the presence of dementia” (Finkel  2001 ). Recent literature has suggested that BPSD are reported in the prodromal and early stages of DSAD and might predict a more severe diagnosis. Often, BPSD are reported in the absence of informant observed functional memory decline (Ball et al.  2006 ), in contrast to the presentation of AD in the general population, where impairments in episodic memory are commonly the first reported changes. 
         The hypothesis that BPSD and executive dysfunction precede memory issues in the pre-clinical and early stages of AD in DS is relatively recent (Ball et al.  2006 ; Adams and Oliver  2010 ; Kitler et al.  2006 ; Nelson et al.  2007 ; Urv et al.  2008 ; Määttä et al.  2014 ; Holland et al.  2000 ). This systematic review indicates that there is a limited but significant amount of research supporting the hypothesis, indicating that people with DS exhibiting BPSD (i.e. those with a history of the onset of these behaviours as opposed to such behaviours being lifelong) are more likely to decline functionally and on testing have evidence of impaired executive functioning compared to those with no such changes (44% compared to 5.6% of those without BPSD). Later the impaired group are then more likely to exhibit memory problems and meet diagnostic criteria for dementia (Ball et al.  2006 ). Similarly, in the study conducted by Holland et al. ( 2000 ), younger people with DS, who did not yet meet the full criteria for a clinical diagnosis of AD, exhibited more ‘frontal-like symptoms’, while older people had higher rates of clinically diagnosed AD. These results were supported by Nelson et al. ( 2007 ), whose study, although not identifying any significant decline in function, due to the short duration between baseline and follow up, argued for the high reliability and validity of measures of “frontal-like symptoms” in the detection of AD early in the disease process, suggesting that EF and BPSD may indeed precede or accompany memory changes in this population 
         This view is also supported by the results of Holland et al. ( 2000 ). At the time of an initial assessment more participants were reportedly exhibiting changes in behaviour (46%) than changes in memory (9%), whereas at follow up. Older participants had the largest proportion of reported deteriorations in memory and personality, whereas younger participants showed high rates of BPSD in absence of any memory issues, suggesting a trend of decline from behaviour and personality to a combination of domains. 
         This sequential progression of BPSD between various stages of dementia was further examined in studies that reported correlations between the severity of BPSD and a dementia diagnosis (Määttä et al.  2014 ; Urv et al.  2008 ). If indeed BPSD are an indicator of dementia development, the question that arises is whether certain types of behaviours are more likely to develop. In Urv et al. ( 2008 ), participants who showed cognitive decline insufficient for a diagnosis of AD exhibited more BPSD directed towards others (i.e. destructiveness, aggression) than those with a diagnosis of AD, who exhibited more BPSD directed towards the self (i.e. fearfulness, lack of energy, withdrawal, sadness and self-injury). Interestingly, participants who progressed from no diagnosis to questionable dementia were more likely to experience a worsening of scores on certain measures (sadness, increased dependency, confusion, fearful and regressive behaviour and social inadequacy), while the scores of people who were dementia-free at T2 remained relatively stable on these measures (Urv et al.  2008 ). Contrary to these findings, Adams and Oliver ( 2010 ) and Makary et al. ( 2014 ) suggested a more positive pattern of ageing than previously reported. 
         Similarly to the situation described in the case of executive functioning, a specific pattern of deterioration in BPSD subdomains is difficult to identify. It was proposed that some of the earliest signs of dementia in people with DS are observed in language and socialization difficulties (Margallo-Lana et al.  2007 ). 
         Improving our understanding of BPSD and their relationship to AD is essential, given that there are people with DS with very low levels of cognitive functioning who are unable to be diagnosed by measures of cognition alone due to floor levels. This group could, however, be diagnosed on the basis of BPSD and everyday skills (Margallo-Lana et al. ( 2007 ). Similar conclusions were reached by Cosgrave et al. ( 2000 ), who concluded that even though in their study memory seems to be the earliest symptom, severe intellectual disability conceals the symptoms and thus, BPSD might be easier to detect 
         Informant reported BPSD such as social withdrawal, apathy (Ball et al.  2006 ; Holland et al.  2000 ), inactivity and lack of interest (Adams and Oliver  2010 ), have been reported in all stages of DSAD (Urv et al.  2008 ) and it is likely that they significantly affect activities of daily living, with declines having been reported in domestic activity, self-direction and responsibility (Määttä et al.  2014 ). However, the authors note that depression is one of the factors that correlate most strongly with such changes (Urv et al.  2008 ) and may often act as a confound due to diagnostic overshadowing (Määttä et al.  2014 ), alongside hypothyroidism. Because of this potential confound, caution is advised when discussing the role of BPSD in the progression of DSAD and these reported changes must always be analyzed as part of a wider context. 
         Changes such as restlessness, aggression, repetitive speech and being uncooperative were most often reported in pre-clinical and early-stages of AD and thus might represent some of the earliest observable signs of dementia (Adams and Oliver  2010 ). Observation of these signs seems to be more likely to lead to a referral for dementia assessment and were shown to emerge alongside cognitive decline. In contrast, Carr and Collins ( 2014 ) in her long-term follow-up of a birth cohort did not find any increase in aggression with the development of dementia. 
         Other BPSD, such as emotional lability, lack of concern for other people, stubbornness, disinhibition and impulsivity, were also reported prior to a diagnosis of dementia (Ball et al.  2006 ). Stubbornness was the second most reported BPSD after apathy in a sample of aging people with DS (Holland et al.  2000 ), and increases in BPSD were identified as successful predictors of dementia status. When analyzed alongside scores for pragnosia, BPSD successfully predicted over 70% of dementia cases (Nelson et al.  2007 ). Urv et al. ( 2008 ) suggests that these changes are present before a dementia diagnosis and gradually worsen as dementia progresses, until late stages of AD when the number of reported distinct behaviours is reduced. 
         
           Activities of Daily Living 
           Activities of daily living (ADLs) represent a number of activities such as continence, eating, walking or grooming (Ward et al.  1998 ) and have been shown to be a good predictor of hospital admission and mortality in the elderly population (Ferrucci et al.  1997 ). Research has suggested that an indicator of the development of AD in people with DS is the loss of everyday skills and difficulties with activities of daily living (Margallo-Lana et al.  2007 ), significantly more affected at age 47, compared to age 30 (Carr and Collins  2014 ). This pattern of decline seems to be supported by other research (Cosgrave et al.  2000 ) and it has thus been suggested that investigating ADLs could be very valuable in diagnosing DSAD, especially in people with severe ID, for whom other changes might be difficult to notice (Margallo-Lana et al.  2007 ). However, caution is advised when interpreting these results, as gender has been suggested to influence rate of decline in ADL in the general population (Ward et al.  1998 ) with women maintaining skills for a longer time in areas such as food preparation, housekeeping and laundry (Lawton and Brody  1969 ). 
           Regarding the hierarchy of loss of ADLs, Cosgrave et al. ( 2000 ) noted that loss of independence in personal hygiene was among the first signs of dementia, alongside spatial disorientation. The last skills to be lost were eating and shaking hands, with 86.9% of participants being able to perform this latter task even in later stages of AD. This is not surprising given the high baseline for the performance of this behavior (i.e. at the beginning of the study, 100% of participants with moderate ID were able to shake hands with the examiner). However, at the end of the study, many participants were completely dependent on nursing staff, having many other difficulties such as incontinence and severe motor difficulties. Considering the advanced nature of the disease in these participants, it is difficult to pinpoint whether loss of a certain skill is due to loss of social conventions or impaired motor function. Regardless, more recent studies in the general population do suggest that motor skills should be addressed in interventions designed for people with AD in order to improve their daily living (Oakley et al.  2003 ). 
         
       
     
     
       Discussion 
       
         Early Signs of Dementia in DS 
         This review highlights the importance of using a broad spectrum of assessments when examining the sequence of decline of dementia in people with DS, particularly in the early stages during which the presentation of dementia may differ between individuals. While there is no overall consensus, there are a majority of research studies identifying clinical characteristics, other than the development of functional memory changes that occur early in the course of AD. However, an evaluation of the papers included in this systematic review indicates that assessing the hierarchy of decline that accompanies the development of dementia in DS is a challenge. First, from a methodological perspective, change has been identified in two separate ways, one being a structured informant-based interview asking specifically about functional changes and the other being the use of established cognitive tests that can be repeated over time to established whether there has been a change in test scores or not. Secondly, as the diagnosis of AD represents a threshold effect, it is difficult to pinpoint in time the exact onset of symptoms. Thirdly, heterogeneity of symptoms seems to be characteristic of the early stages, and inferences regarding which subdomains of functioning are preferentially affected are very difficult to make. Fourthly, in people with DS it is especially difficult to determine whether the observed symptoms are due to age-related changes in this population or to preexisting cognitive impairments (Ball et al.  2006 ). In the longest longitudinal study included in this review, scores on the majority of cognitive tests declined by age 47, regardless of dementia status (Carr and Collins  2014 ), emphasizing that researchers must be cautious when interpreting results, as for a proportion of participants showing this decline it might suggest pre-clinical symptoms of dementia, it might also reflect normal ageing. 
         The findings from this systematic review would indicate that BPSD and impairments in executive functioning mark the early course of DSAD. Numerous components of executive function and behavior seem to be affected before memory skills begin to decline, suggesting that current diagnosis procedures of AD in DS may not be effective until later stages. This view is supported by a recent review (Ballard et al.  2016 ), which suggested that dementia in DS initially manifests as BPSD, only to later be followed by changes in cognition. 
         There are, however, important differences between study findings that may reflect genuine sample differences or may be accounted for by differences in methodology. These differences make an overall picture difficult to ascertain. BPSD and executive dysfunction were often investigated as part of studies primarily concerned with cognition whereas memory changes were reported as part of studies that were carried out with the intention of confirming the presence of memory decline. Moreover, some studies only analyzed a restricted range of abilities and reported on total scores alone, without specifying the exact area of decline. Given the wide variety of screening and diagnosis tools in use, as well as recent research suggesting decline in cognitive function regardless of whether participants have had a formal diagnosis of dementia, we support the recent suggestion made by Ballard et al. ( 2016 ), that measures of prevalence reported in published papers should be interpreted with a degree of caution. 
         Moreover, as with all neuropsychological testing, there is overlap in measurement. For example, a decline in a test of episodic memory would have to be carefully interpreted if there are poor results on attentional tasks. Due to this confounding factor, we advise caution when discussing the results of these papers, as it often is difficult to establish whether a participant’s decline on one measure is not influenced by decline in another related domain. 
         Lastly, interpreting results was hindered by the fact that the majority of studies did not report on the level of intellectual disability of participants. This issue is essential, considering that the salience, manifestation and degree of impairment determined by the emergence of AD symptoms can vary according to the level of premorbid intellectual capacity and also the person’s ability to compensate for the newly acquired deficits. Margallo-Lana et al. ( 2007 ) demonstrated that significant cognitive decline at follow - up could only be identified for cases where the baseline score had been at or above the median (mild and moderate ID), with little changes being noticeable for people with severe and profound ID. Moreover, the majority of studies (Adams and Oliver  2010 , Kitler et al.  2006 , Carr and Collins  2014 , Cosgrave et al.  2000 , Krinsky-McHale et al.  2002 , Nelson et al.  2007 , Margallo-Lana et al.  2007 , McCarron et al.  2014 , Makary et al.  2014 , Määttä et al.  2014 ) did not document whether dementia was at an early or advanced stage. As changes in function seem to vary both quantitatively and qualitatively over the course of AD, future research should report the stage of decline, as well as age and IQ. 
       
       
         Recommendations 
         Given the findings of this review, we believe that establishing a baseline level of cognitive functioning and behaviour in people with DS would be extremely useful in following up on changes in domains known to be affected by AD. We therefore advocate the development of a set of common measures appropriate for individuals with DS that would include in depth evaluation of memory, executive function, language and behaviour and that can be used both in clinical settings as well as research. This would allow the implementation of Burt and Aylward’s model of best practice (Burt and Aylward  2000 ) which suggests establishing a baseline of premorbid functioning before the age of 35, having annual reassessments and conducting a detailed diagnosis in cases where decline is evident. More research needs to be conducted in order to decide on the exact measures to be included in this tool set, given the intra-individual variability in task performance in people with DS (Krinsky-McHale et al.  2008 ). At present, standard tools developed for the assessment of cognition in the general population often show floor effects when administered to individuals with DS (Stanton and Coetzee  2004 ) and the majority of the assessment tools are based on the premise that respondents have an IQ in or close to the normative range and require other skills such as good verbal skills, adequate attention or dexterity (Prasher et al.  2004 ). Burt et al. ( 2005 ) have emphasised the need for an appropriate scoring method for diagnosing dementia in this population and suggested that slope scores are more useful than difference scores. For example, institutionalised individuals with DS are known to score lower on neuropsychological tests than people living in the community (Nieuwenhuis-Mark  2009 ) and thus having an established baseline and measuring change over time in a longitudinal follow up design would be a better approach than cross-sectional studies. 
         Given that the majority of the studies included in this review point towards BPDS as an early sign of dementia in DS, we believe that there is an urgent need for the development of an acceptable, validated and standardised evaluation scale for BPSD in DS (Sinai et al.  2016 ), similar to BEHAVE-AD in the general population (Dekker et al.  2015 ). 
         Furthermore, diagnostic and assessment measures developed for use in the general population are often used in studies investigating AD in DS, which often introduces confounding factors (Ballard et al.  2016 ). This issue was pointed out by Dekker et al. ( 2015 ) who stated that although more than 20 scales have been developed to assess BPSD in AD in the general population (Finkel  2001 ), none of these have been validated in people with DS and therefore are not equally valuable for use in this population as they do not take into consideration factors such as pre-existing behavioural issues associated with ID. In line with the findings of Dekker et al. ( 2015 ), such a scale could be implemented in routine practice alongside existing assessment procedures which monitor change over time, as well as being used in longitudinal research and clinical trials. 
         Having comprehensive assessment tools for outcomes in clinical trials would enable a targeted approach to drug development, which would be essential given recent findings suggesting that people with DS respond differently to treatment when compared to late-onset AD typically developing controls (Ballard et al.  2016 ). Moreover, a better understanding of BPSD in DS would increase acceptance from the perspective of a carer who would understand that behaviour they perceive as “challenging” is not deliberate but may be a symptom of dementia (Dekker et al.  2015 ). Imporved recognition of symptoms would facilitate access to non-pharmacological treatments such as behavioural and music therapy and psychosocial interventions (Gauthier et al.  2010 ). 
         To account for the fact that BPSD and executive dysfunction seem to be affected earlier than episodic memory in the course of dementia, we suggest Mortimer’s reserve capacity hypothesis ( 1981 ) as a viable theoretical explanation. According to this model, the frontal lobes of people with DS are underdeveloped and thus a smaller buden of neuropathology in the brain may be required to reach the threshold at which functioning is impaired. Volume reduction of frontal lobes has been observed during childhood, while hippocampal volume reduction has only been reported later in life (Jacola  2012 ). These observations would account for the preferential decline in areas of cognition sub-served by these areas. Indirect support for Mortimer’s reserve capacity hypothesis comes from the longitudinal study conducted by Temple et al. ( 2001 ), in which progression of dementia appears to be slowed by having high levels of pre-morbid cognitive functioning. The authors suggest that environmental interventions such as improving the level of education and number of years in employment might represent successful strategies to reduce cognitive decline. The suggestion that early clinical presentation of AD in DS matches that of frontal-based symptoms can serve as a theoretical foundation for the findings of neuroimaging studies such as the recent amyloid PET imaging with 18F–FDDNP study that showed increased frontal predominance of amyloid pathology in people with DS who had a diagnosis of AD, compared to typically developing patients with late-onset AD (Nelson et al.  2011 ). 
         To conclude, even though there is no overall consensus on what represents the earliest observable sign of dementia in DS, this review highlights the heterogeneity of affected domains. BPSD, developing for the first time in later adult life, predicts the subsequent development of dementia in the majority of the included studies. There is also evidence that emergence of BPSD is underpinned by impairments in executive functioning that may implicate impairments in frontal lobe integrity and in related brain networks (Ball et al.  2008 ). We recommend that future research should investigate a wider variety of processes, to reflect the heterogeneity of domains that seem to be affected in the prodromal and early stages of dementia in this population. Moreover, considering that in the general population amnestic MCI is widely accepted as the prodromal stage of AD, an alternative should be proposed for people with DS, to reflect this difference in progression. The key to early diagnosis is knowing what observed changes should raise the index of suspicion sufficiently to indicate the need for a full diagnostic assessment and cognitive evaluation. The findings of this review are especially relevant given that current diagnosis procedures (ICD-10 and DSM-V criteria) emphasize declines in memory functions and therefore in this population may fail to facilitate the early detection and diagnosis of dementia when it does occur.
