diet is not fully understood The typical Mongolian diet is characterized by high and frequent consumption of fermented dairy products and red meat and low level of carbohydrates In this study the gut microbiota profile of Mongolians whom consumed wheat rice and oat as the sole carbohydrate staple food for a week each consecutively was determined It was observed that changes in staple carbohydrate rapidly a altered gut microbial community structure and metabolic pathway of the subjects Wheat and oat favored bifidobacteria Bifidobacterium catenulatum Bifodobacteriumbifidum Bifidobacterium adolescentis whereas rice suppressed bifidobacteria Bifidobacterium longum Bifidobacterium adolescentis and wheat suppresses Lactobaciilus Ruminococcus and Bacteroides The study exhibited two gut microbial clustering patterns with the preference of fucosyllactose utilization linking to fucosidase genes hydrolase family classifications and encoded by Bifidobacterium and xylan and arabinoxylan utilization linking to xylanase and arabinoxylanase genes encoded by Bacteroides There was also a correlation between Lactobacillus ruminis and sialidase as well as Butyrivibrio crossotus and xylanase xylosidase Meanwhile a strong concordance was found between the gastrointestinal bacterial microbiome and the intestinal virome Present research will contribute to understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor microbial populations and the health of global humans intestinal microbiome carbohydrateutilization Mongolians staple food Introduction The assessment of microbial communities in human feces has uncovered a large quantity and types of microbial species colonizing the human gut A growing body of research has indicated that the microbial communities are associated with the digestion of dietary macronutrients production of nutrients and vitamins and maintenance of the host immunity Thus the gastrointestinal microbiota can be considered a highly active metabolic organ to complement the human metabolic activities Wu et al found that two enterotypes Prevotella community and Bacteroides were defined among human communities in different geographical regions The Prevotella community and the Bacteroides community were associated with fiber intake and high protein intake respectively The dietary fibers proteins and peptides which escape digestion by host enzymes in the upper gut are metabolized by the microbiota in the colon thus determine the microbiota in the lower reach of the gut and feces Macfarlane and Macfarlane The metabolites such as fatty acids that are produced by gut bacterial fermentation are available to the hostenterocytes and can influence host physiological processes The balance of the gut microbial community is a major determining factor in human physiological functions Many reports have demonstrated determining factors of the gut microbial community these includehost genotype diet age disease and use of antibiotic Yatsunenko et al It is commonly accepted that diet has a major influence on the gut microbial community The structure of the gut microbial community can be changed by consumption of a habitual diet Ley et al Walker et al Wu et al as well as consumption of certain diets David et al Dietary alteration in the gut microbiota profile could be temporal David et al or irreversible Sonnenburg et al In China the dietary habit is significantly different from the western diets Chinese diet revolves around a diet such as cereal vegetable and fruit supplemented with protein such as dairy products seafood and meat The grain rice and naked is generally called staple food and accounts for a high proportion of the daily diet In different areas of China people have different dietary habit the general staple food for people living south of Yangtze River is rice Oryza sativa var in the area north of the Yangtze River people subsist chiefly on wheat Triticum spp whereas people in the north of the Yellow River one of the major staple food is naked oats Avena sativa The wheat rice and naked oats contain different content of carbohydrates starch polysaccharides and For example the wheat contains about of carbohydrates mainly as xylose and arabinose the naked oats contain of arabinose and whereas rice contains carbohydrate Bednar et al The different grain intake may have an influence on the gut microbiota A diet intervention study based on administration of showed changes in the gut microbial composition De Angelis et al The effects of carbohydrate staple diet on the gut microbial community have been little studied A recent study comparing fecal microbiota profile of central Asian and and Southeast Asia and speculated that carbohydrates and meat consumption are determining dietary factors in the Bacteroides Nakayama et al It is the aim of this study to investigate the effect of the three staple food grains on the gut microbial communities via diet intervention The typical Mongolian diet is characterized by a high and frequent consumption of fermented dairy products and red meat and a low level of the grain intake The result of the diet intervention based on the type of carbohydrates for Mongolian may be more obvious than that of the Chinese In our previous study Bull by using the PacBio single molecule sequencing technology we revealed the changes in intestinal microbiota of Mongolian volunteers based on rRNA variable regions response to staple carbohydrate The intestinal microbiome was composed of the microbial taxonomy microbial function and metabolic pathway So previous research only focused on the microbial taxonomic level meet our further understanding of the interaction between the intestinal microbiome and diet Accordingly in present research the shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach was applied to generate huge sequencing reads of microbial whole genomes Following procedure analysis involving assembling gene prediction and pathway annotation enabled us to pay more attention to changes in intestinal microbial functional genes and metabolic pathways Meanwhile a robust network based on species metabolic pathway and food nutrition was constructed for helping us understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary factor microbial populations and the health of global humans Materials and Methods Study Design and Sample Collection In present research Mongolian subjects years started the experiments on day upon arrival in China All subjects had no gastrointestinal disorder and did not take any antibiotics for three months before the experiment started and until the end of the experiment During the experiment dietary staple food was replaced each week first week wheat the second week rice and third week and the amount and species of food intake for each individual was the same every day The information was shown in the Supplementary Table And the diet was prepared by a restaurant according to the designed recipes All volunteers were instructed to eat only the provided foods or allowable beverages or unsweetened They also confirmed that no remarkable changes occurred in their diet intake and no medication was taken during the experiment The fecal samples of each individual in time points week to week were collected for further sequencing The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Inner Mongolia Agriculture University Sampling and all subsequent steps described in the Materials and Methods have been conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines After obtaining the written informed consent we collected habitual dietary information from all participants using a food frequency questionnaire Table All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Metagenomic DNA Extraction The QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit Hilden was used for DNA extraction from the fecal samples The quality of the metagenomic DNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis All of the DNA samples were stored at until further processing Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing and Quality Control The Illumina platform was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing reads were generated with bp in the forward and reverse directions The length of each read was trimmed with Sickle This set of reads was then used for a further analysis An average of gigabases of reads were obtained for each sample totalling more than Tb of data free of host genomic and adaptor contaminants Shotgun Metagenomic Reads De novo Assembly Gene Prediction and Construction of the Gene Catalog The Illumina reads were assembled into contigs using Peng et al with default parameters Genes were predicted on the contigs with MetaGeneMark Zhu et al A gene catalog was constructed with Li and Godzik using a sequence identity of with a minimum coverage of for the shorter sequences This catalog contained microbial genes Computation of Relative Gene Abundance To assess the abundance of genes profile reads were aligned to the gene catalog with Langmead et al using the following parameters nt fastq fastq R sam Then for any sample N we calculated the abundance as follows Step Calculation of the copy number of each gene b i x i L i Step Calculation of the relative abundance of gene i a i b i i b i ai the relative abundance of gene i bi the copy number of gene i from sample N Li the length of gene i xi the number of mapped reads Construction of the Taxonomic Profiling We use Segata et al to produce organism abundance profiling with default parameters which relied on about million unique marker genes identified from about reference genomes Meanwhile the metagenomic reads were annotated by the NCBI virus database to build the virome profile Annotation of KEGG CAZy and ARGs Database We aligned the amino acid sequences that were translated from the gene catalog against the proteins domains to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and antibiotic resistance genes databases using BLASTP e with a higher than Each protein was assigned to the KEGG ortholog group or ARG number by the highest scoring annotated hit CAZymes were predicted from amino acid sequences by against to HMM of CAZymes in dbCAN database Yin et al using Hmmscan program in HMMER package Eddy KEGG Pathway Analysis Differentially enriched KO modules and pathways were identified according to the reporterscores Patil and Nielsen from the Z of individual KOs Accordingly the Z adjusted pathway of each KEGG module and pathway was calculated as previously described Patil and Nielsen Then the Z adjusted pathway was used as the final reporter score for evaluating the enrichment of specific pathways or modules A reporter score of confidence according to the normal could be used as a detection threshold for significantly differentiating pathways Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were undertaken using the R software PCoA and a kernel density distribution analysis were performed using the Zapala and Schork package of R software Differential abundance of species genes and KOs were tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the significantly different p The heatmap was built in R using the package The correlation between the dietary components metabolic pathways and relative genera were calculated by rank correlation coefficient and visualized by network in Cytoscape Accession Numbers The sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the NCBI database data Results Dynamic Profile of Gut Microbiome in Response to Changes in Staple Food The fecal samples for all subjects were collected weekly on time points at week and Subsequently microbial DNAs from a total of fecal samples were extracted for metagenomic analysis By employing the shotgun metagenomic sequencing we obtained more than base of reads reads for each The reads were assembled into contigs and the genes were predicted onthe contigs Then a gene catalog including genes was constructed Annotated by HMP database thus taxonomy profile of each sample was obtained Meanwhile the reads were mapped to the collective gene catalog to reconstruct gene profile as well as the profiles for the associated KEGG database Orthologs Supplementary Table At the taxonomy level Principal Coordinates Analysis was performed based on the unweighted UniFrac Figure weighted UniFrac Figure and distances Figure at the species level No significant apparent clustering pattern was identified among samples in different time points and the fluctuation in gut microbiota was limited by individuals It is indicated the staple change was smaller than the difference This conclusion held true when the data was analyzed at microbial functional feature level Figure By extracting and comparing the first principal component of distance matrices representing taxonomic and functional features in gut community structure among subjects at each time point we found that changed staple food rapidly altered microbial community structure and metabolic pathway Figure for each individual Then we concluded that the intestinal microbiota could be rapidly altered by staple food however the changes was limited at level Additionally in comparing the influence of the food on gut microbiome it can be observed from the Weighted UniFrac distance between groups at different time points that the impact of wheat on intestinal microbiota was the largest followed by rice and oat Figure FIGURE A principal component score plot based on unweighted UniFrac metrics for all samples The sample represented points were connected and colored by the sample represented points were colored by time points FIGURE The changed staple food rapidly altered microbial community structure and metabolic pathway for each individual The taxonomic fluctuation of based on weighted UniFrac matrix The functional fluctuation of based on matrix The CAZy fluctuation of based on matrix FIGURE The weighted UniFrac distances based on taxonomic abundance among different staple foods groups The distances based on functional features abundance among different staple foods groups We identified differences in specific species at taxonomy level and metabolic pathway at functional level after the consumption of the respective staple food As it is shown in Table the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii Ruminococcus gnavus Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides massiliensis decreased significantly but the Bifidobacterium catenulatum Bifidobacterium bifidum and Alistipes indistinctus increased significantly when subjects consumed the wheat as staple food for one week When rice and oat was assigned as the staple food in the second and third week respectively Bifidobacterium adolescentis Bifidobacterium longum Weissella cibaria and Rothia mucilaginosa declined sharply in the second week whereas the Bifidobacterium adolescentis risen sharply in the third week At the functional level we calculated the reporter Z scores of each pathway or module by using the reporter feature algorithm Figure A reporter score confidence according to the normal was used as the detection threshold for significantly differentiating modules or pathways In particular we found a significant decline in the microbial biosynthesis of amino acids valine leucine and in the first week In contrast the microbial metabolism of carbohydrate kept growing during experiment Interestingly it exhibited a high concordance of changes in microbial capacity for fructose metabolism and glycolysis and the changes in relative content of fructose and glucose in wheat rice and oat And these results could be confirmed by changes in metabolic models among different staple food intake group Table

metabolic module among different staple foods groups by using the reporter feature algorithm week vs week vs week vs week Functional Correlation of Species with Changes in the Staple Food Using Wilcoxon sum t we identified species which showed significant difference in each staple food group We focused on the correlation between functionality and changes in the staple food The species which showed correlations included Bacteroidesovatus Faecalibacteriumprausnitzii Lactobacillus ruminis Bacteroidesstercoris and Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens We determined the correlation among the species and their typical metabolic pathway model according to rank correlation coefficient R Figure Interestingly a general positive correlation was observed between the species above and the phosphotransferase system and the biosynthesis and a negative correlation with the FoxO signaling pathway and Cyanoamino acid metabolism FIGURE The correlation among the species in stable content and their typical metabolic pathway and typical metabolic model according to rank correlation coefficient Concordance of the Gastrointestinal Bacterial Microbiome and Virome All sequences were annotated by a virus protein database and then we selected and constructed the phage or bacterial virus profile A total of species of phages were identified Table and the quantity of phage of Enterobacteria Bacteriophage Shigella Klebsiella Escherichia Streptococcus Salmonella Bacteroides Lactococcus Lactobacillus Clostridium Haemophilus Staphylococcus Brochothrix and Bacillus accounted for more than of the total microbiota Figure Meanwhile the correlations among the above phages were determined based on rank correlation Figure and a general positive correlation was found Additionally to test the degree of consistency between the observed clustering patterns for bacterial structure and phage structure respectively Procrustes analysis was performed based on the PCA matrix of bacterial organismal profile and that of genus level phage profile Figure The results revealed a strong correspondence between the two profiles above P using Monte Carlo label which also indicated a potential synergistic interaction between the bacteria and bacterial virus in human gastrointestinal tract The Functional Specificity of Intestinal Microbiota for Carbohydrate Utilization As the main component of the staple food in the present study was carbohydrate we focused on the functional specificity of intestinal microbiota for carbohydrate utilization The gene catalog in our study was annotated by enzymes database and a total of carbohydrate metabolism related enzymes were identified Table By applying the test we observed significant difference in enzymes among the different staple food groups and these enzymes were mainly related to the metabolism of glucose Figure Meanwhile by clustering analysis we exhibited the correlation profile between the microbial species and the enzymes Figure and two apparent clustering patterns could be found in the profile which indicated two groups of intestinal microbiota with preference for specific carbohydrates utilization Accordingly we reconstruct the network between the species and their metabolic enzymes for each group Figure The first group including the species of Alistipe sputredinis Bacteroides intestinalis Bacteroides massiliensis Bacteroides plebeius Bacteroides salyersiae Bacteroides vulgutas Bacteroides uniformis Butyrivibrio crossotus Megaspha eraelsdenii Parabacteroides merdae and Paraprevotella clara and they were closely related to the enzymes of arabinofuranosidase pectin lyase polygalacturonaseand xylanase The second group including the species of Alistipesonderdonkii Bacteroides fragilis Bifidobacterium adolescentis Bifidobacterium breve Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum Lactobacillus ruminis Ruminococcus gnavus and Streptococcus thermophilus and they were closely related to the enzymes of mannosidase trehalose phosphorylase fucosidase and sialidase FIGURE The specificity of intestinal microbiota for carbohydrate utilizing The first species network group were closely related to the enzymes of arabinofuranosidase pectin lyase polygalacturonase and xylanase The second species network group were closely related to the enzymes of mannosidase trehalose phosphorylase fucosidase and sialidase The Linear Relationship between Intestinal Microbial Phylum and Main Nutrient Elements The results above based on the impacts of changes in staple food on intestinal microbiome offered us an excellent opportunity to reveal the linear relationship between intestinal microbial phylum and main nutrient elements which was also the basic mechanism related to the interaction between the diet and gut microbiome According to the fitted curves we observed a declined in phylum Actinobacteria but an increase in phylum Firmicutes with the gradually increasing carbohydrates content in diet Figure At the same time the phylum Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria presented a positive correlation with the dietary fat and digestible carbohydrate respectively Figure FIGURE The linear relationship between intestinal microbial phylum and main nutrient elements The relationship among the intestinal microbiota dietary nutrition and ARGs The Relationship between Intestinal Microbiota Dietary Nutrition and ARGs To further understand the dietary effects on human microbiome we annotated our gene catalog with the ARGs database and constructed the ARGs profile of each individuals By merging and classifying annotated ARGs were clustered into antibiotic catalog Table We found that the ARGs related to vancomycin were most abundant followed by the ARGs related to macrolide tetracycline bacitracin tigecycline penicillin chloramphenicol lincosamide and aminoglycoside which gene abundance were more than To describe the relationship among the dietary nutrition microbial phylum and ARGs above a Circos on line diagram was constructed Figure Discussion By employing the shotgun metagenomic sequencing we described the dynamic profile of gut microbiome in response to changes in staple food The composition of the gut microbiome can be considered as a complex trait with the quantitative variation in the microbiome affected by a large number of host and environmental factors each of which may have only a small additive effect making it difficult to identify the association for each separate item A research study of participants from a Dutch cohort showed relations between the microbiome and exogenous and intrinsic host factors including intrinsic factors diseases drug groups smoking categories and dietary factors Zhernakova et al They observed that fecal chromogranin A a protein secreted by enteroendocrine cells was exclusively associated with microbial species whose abundance collectively accounted for of microbial composition Even so the diet and the genotype were also considered as the main force for shaping human intestinal microbiome although it remains unclear if this is primarily driven by host genetics or by extrinsic factors like dietary intake To address this another recent study Carmody et al examined the effect of dietary perturbations on the gut microbiota of five inbred mouse strains and revealed the consumption of a diet reproducibly altered the gut microbiota despite differences in host genotype Repeated dietary shifts demonstrated that most changes to the gut microbiota are reversible which emphasize diet dominates host genotype in shaping the murine gut microbiota Nevertheless in the present study we observed the staple change was much smaller than the difference which indicated the complexity of the interaction between the baseline microbiota and diet change Besides we also found that changes in staple food rapidly altered microbial community structure and metabolic pathway for each individual Recent research also confirmed gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet within day David et al and an diet had a greater effect on the microbiota than a diet In our previous study the effect of gut microbiota communities by the diet intervention of meals composed principally of wheat rice and oats was investigated by the PacBio single molecule sequencing technology based on rRNA variable region During the diet switch within a period the bacterial richness and diversity decreased apparently along the diet intervention And the structure of gut microbiota communities after the diet switch was found to be different from those before the diet switch The previous research only focused on the changes in the microbial taxonomic level but the intestinal microbiome including the microbial taxonomy and microbial function and metabolic pathway Accordingly in present research we pay more attention to the changes in intestinal microbial functional genes and metabolic pathways response to staple carbohydrate To probe for the potential metabolic mechanism underlying the dominant species Bacteroides ovatus Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Lactobacillus ruminis Bacteroides stercoris an Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens which thrive in the gut environment we analyzed the functional features in these bacteria and revealed that these microbes were enriched in the metabolic pathway of PTS PTS is an active sugar uptake method in low nutrient environment The bacterial PTS is a perfect example of both the opportunistic nature of bacterial life and their thrifty use of resources In the present study the of the metabolic pathway of phosphotransferase efficiently provide the source of energy for the species involved so that they can effectively and stably proliferated in human gut The human enteric microbiome contains viruses bacteria archaea fungi and other eukaryotic organisms Norman et al Virgin Enteric human virome and bacterial microbiome alterations have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease obesity and changes in host behavior Backhed et al Lyte Norman et al In the present study we observed a robust synergistic interaction between the bacteria and bacterial virus in human gastrointestinal tract in dynamic equilibrium with all components of the microbiome Accordingly an emerging concept is that the virome may contain mutualistic symbiotes with some effects that benefit the host and others by modulating the population of their bacterial host Bacteriophages regulate the bacterial microbiome via gene transfer killing competing bacteria to allow invasion of bacteria to fill a partly emptied niche or by encoding toxins that alter the host intestine to foster bacterial pathogenesis Duerkop and Hooper The ability to utilize complex dietary and host glycans is central to the survival of prominent members of the gut microbiota Plants in the form of fruits vegetables and cereals are major components of the human diet El Kaoutari et al They provide carbohydrates that are readily digested by human intestinal enzymes as well as dietary fibers which are resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine enzymes encoded by the human gut microbiome catalyze the breakdown of glycoconjugates oligosaccharides and polysaccharides to fermentable monosaccharides El Kaoutari et al Here we exhibited two apparent gut microbial clustering patterns with the preference of specific carbohydrates utilization For instance the fucosyllactose utilization was linked tofucosidase genes hydrolase family classifications and encoded by Bifidobacterium Milani et al and the xylan and arabinoxylan utilization was linked to xylanase and arabinoxylanase genesencoded by Bacteroides Wu et al Furthermore we revealed the robust correlation between the Lactobacillus ruminis and sialidase as well as the Butyrivibriocrossotus and xylanase xylosidase These findings allow modeling of human gut microbiome responding to diet change and prebiotics for precision microbiota manipulation In summary this study describes the dynamic profile of gut microbiome in Mongolians in response to changes in staple food wheat rice and oat as the sole for weeks and revealed the impact of wheat on intestinal microbiota was the largest followed by rice and oat Accordingly we exhibited the specificity of intestinal microbiota for carbohydrate utilizing and the linear relationship between intestinal microbiota and major nutrient elements Meanwhile a strong concordance was found between the gastrointestinal bacterial microbiome and the intestinal virome Present research will contribute to understanding the impacts of the dietary carbohydrate on human gut microbiome which will ultimately help understand relationships between dietary

accepted academic practice No use distribution or reproduction is permitted which does not comply with these terms Objective Motor evoked potentials obtained by transcranial magnetic stimulation enable measures of the corticospinal excitability However the reliability of CSE measures is suboptimal due to appreciable MEP amplitude variability We thus calculated how many MEPs will be needed to obtain a reliable CSE measure in awake adult subjects in the eyes open and eyes closed conditions Methods Twenty healthy adults received consecutive navigated TMS pulses resting motor threshold in the EO or EC conditions on two separate days in randomized order Results For either the EO or EC condition the probability that the confidence interval derived from consecutive MEP amplitude measured included the true CSE increased when the number of consecutive stimuli increased p EC p No significant effect of RMT State Examination score or gender on the CSE estimates was identified At least consecutive stimuli were required to obtain a most reliable CSE estimate in the EO condition and in the EC condition Conclusion Our findings indicate that consecutive MEPs may be necessary in order to obtain a CSE measure in healthy adults motor evoked potential electromyography muscles transcranial magnetic stimulation Introduction Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a painless and safe method for focal cortical stimulation induced by generating magnetic field by passing a brief intracranial electrical current through a magnetic coil et al Kobayashi and When applied to the primary motor cortex and coupled with hand surface electromyography TMS is often used to measure corticospinal excitability as reflected in the amplitude or area under the curve of a hand muscle motor evoked potential CSE is generally equated to the average MEP amplitude resulting from multiple stimuli to the same region at identical intensities et al Magistris et al et al Pitcher et al Darling et al Mars et al Bashir et al Roy Choudhury et al Lewis et al Cakar et al Yet MEP amplitudes vary considerably from pulse to pulse in individual subjects et al et al Pitcher et al Roy Choudhury et al and this leads to compromising reliability of CSE metrics In most protocols MEPs are averaged for the CSE estimate et al et al Pitcher et al Bashir et al Roy Choudhury et al Lewis et al Yet number of TMS pulses and MEPs that are necessary to obtain a reliable CSE estimate is unknown We therefore stimulated the motor cortex in healthy volunteers and measured the number of intrinsic hand muscle MEP amplitudes that would be needed to obtain a reliable CSE estimate Since the instantaneous state of cortical motor neuron and cortical interneuron activity likely plays a role in MEP amplitude variability in TMS experiments we obtained these measures in two conditions awake with eyes open and eyes closed which previously have been demonstrated to modulate cortical and or spinal motoneural output et al In the present experiment we hypothesized to test whether the number of pulses needed to establish a CSE metric from the first dorsal interosseous muscle representation is mediated by factor for which studies may not reliably control activation of the visual system as defined by the EO and EC condition Materials and Methods Subjects Twenty control subjects participated in this study The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Oldfield was administered to verify that all subjects were The participants had normal cognitive scores range as indexed by State Examination Folstein et al Table Demographic table Age Gender state examination Weight Resting motor threshold of maximum stimulator output Motor evoked potentials Motor evoked potentials Participants underwent two experimental sessions separated by week using a a crossover randomized design during which they underwent TMS with MEP monitoring in either the EO or EC condition Participants had no contraindications to receive TMS and were not taking any medication known to affect motor cortical excitability at the time of the study et al Furthermore neurological examination of the subjects revealed no abnormal signs to suggest any underlying neurological or psychological condition The investigation was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Review Board Khalid University All participants gave their written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study Experimental The stimulation setup consisted of a frameless stereotaxic system for navigation connected to TMS system Pro All subjects had a anatomical head magnetic resonance image that was used to ensure stimulation accuracy during and across sessions In each session errors to the surface landmarks were matched to mm Surface EMG signals were recorded from FDI muscle in which active electrodes were attached and reference electrodes were placed over the metacarpophalangeal joints These EMG signals were filtered amplified displayed and stored for analysis The TMS system delivered trigger pulses that synchronized with EMG systems During the sessions participants sat on a comfortable chair with their hands in a supine position on their laps wearing earplugs and remaining silent to avoid modulation of cortical et al TMS Protocol All subjects had undergone a structural MRI scan before TMS session Imaging data were fed to the navigation software ANT for automatic brain reconstruction that was used to guide navigation and deliver TMS over In each TMS session the motor cortical output was mapped carefully for the optimal representation of the FDI muscle on left hemisphere as previously described et al The TMS coil was held tangentially to the skull with the coil handle pointed to the sagittal plane which the coil and the induced current on the cortex orientated perpendicularly to the anatomically defined central sulcus and induces a current direction et al Each resting motor threshold was determined as the minimum stimulation output TMS intensity that produced at least out of MEPs that was obtained at that location The site which evoked MEPs with highest amplitude the hot was then marked on each MRI Nearly always the hotspot did not sometimes the coil position needed a minor adjustment in roll or pitch Forty single stimuli s apart were delivered to the hot spot at an intensity of of RMT to determine baseline MEP peak to peak amplitude for the EO and EC conditions MEP Data Analysis To minimize the variability of individual MEPs they were screened for artifact and for signal indicating voluntary contraction and excluded if the root mean square EMG exceeded mV during the period immediately preceding the onset of the TMS pulse as previously described et al All subjects data were analyzed for blocks and of consecutive TMS stimuli at RMT The order of these two conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across participants For each subject the average MEPs of EO or EC was calculated for subsets of consecutive stimuli MEPn n n M E P where n The generalized estimating equation SAS Institute Cary NC was used to determine the contribution of the EO and EC condition as well as gender and MMSE score on the MEPn To evaluate the accuracy of the MEP estimates a confidence interval was calculated using all stimuli for each subject per condition as previously described et al Based on both the MEPn values and the CI it is possible to determine whether MEPn is included in CI yielding a binary variable not included in the CI included in the as previously described by Cuypers et al The number of consecutive stimuli required as a function of the probability of hitting the CI Results The CSE estimates did not differ between the EO and EC conditions The probability that MEPn fell within the CI CSE estimate increased with successive TMS pulses The GEE analysis showed that the estimate of the CI increased when the number of consecutive stimuli increased p for EO and p for Figure The mean and subject data of eye open mean the data of The Y shows the motor evoked potential amplitude while the number of

required as a function of the probability of hitting the confidence interval for EC Discussion We demonstrate that stimuli are required to obtain an accurate CSE estimate when MEP measures are obtained from the FDI muscle in healthy adults Notably this measure is independent of RMT and gender This basic practical information might play a crucial role for obtaining a reliable CSE in the TMS experiments This study showed the reliability as every part of the data were collected by the same rater The interpretation of our results about CSE estimates by number of consecutive stimuli might be required different for other age groups and in disease populations because our data was obtained in healthy young subjects Second all subjects were informed with respect to the experimental procedures due to uncertainty about their first TMS which likely caused changes in attention and this variable may differ from study to study Furthermore experimental TMS different coil types and EMG hardware and signal analysis for noise elimination can affect variability and reliability of the CSE measurements Last our measures were obtained from the CI muscle and a different numerical result may be seen in other muscle groups It is paramount that any reliability studies such as ours clearly outline the extent to which its results can be generalized We thus proposed to extrapolate from our results with qualification Reliability and reproducibility of protocol depends on the sample the paradigm the TMS setup and the operator et al The variability related to the TMS method should be similar across the laboratories when one considers that we used stimulator and recording devices that is commonly available This is the first TMS reliability study showing spatial stimulation stability within and between sessions using neuronavigation et al It is noteworthy to emphasize that the lack of controlling in pitch and roll of TMS coil just by using marked scalps or swimming caps can cause measurement error as it allows spatial drift et al and reduces the constancy and strength of intracranial electrical currents conveyed to a target et al The design of TMS experiments can be improved

microRNAs are usually embedded in those regions Recent work has shown that the genomic context is of utmost importance to determine miRNA expression in time and space thus affecting their evolutionary fates over long and short terms Consequently understanding the and intraspecific changes on miRNA genomic architecture may bring novel insights on the basic cellular processes regulated by miRNAs as well as phenotypic evolution and mechanisms intragenic intergenic region new and old miRNAs host gene target interactions expression breadth Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento e de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de Paulo Introduction Recent projects have revealed an outstanding transcriptome diversity especially of RNAs as well as a wealth of regulatory mechanisms and gene product interactions that compound the molecular basis of phenotypes Carninci et al Mele et al A notable feature that soon became clear is the interleaved nature of eukaryotic genomes despite their typical large sizes This means that a particular genomic region can be suited for different purposes with an extensive overlap of transcriptional units either in sense or antisense DNA strands Kapranov et al The interleaved model opens up numerous possibilities for regulatory mechanisms For instance products of antisense transcription which is believed to occur in more than of gene loci in humans Galante et al can regulate gene activity through many different ways in Pelechano and Steinmetz In the interleaved genome transcription units may show high interdependency whereby neighboring or overlapping genes can be by shared regulatory yet structural changes in the chromatin environment can also influence their expression coordinately Mellor et al Complex transcriptional networks thus emerge from a modular architecture that can either be shaped by evolutionary advantages and constraints Mercer and Mattick but also as a result of neutral processes Graur et al Such interleaved architecture is particularly striking in regard to microRNAs Ever since the first studies on their genomic organization Rodriguez et al it is commonly observed that these small RNAs overlap to genes with vertebrate miRNAs mapping to intronic regions more than expected by chance Baskerville and Bartel Hinske et al et al Meunier et al As they comprise an essential class of gene expression regulators in basic biological processes and diseases genomic context analyses are pivotal to uncover unique aspects of miRNA biology Here we discuss recent advances in this topic focusing on the importance of the genomic context to miRNA expression and their target interactions In this framework we highlight the evolutionary consequences for the fixation of newly emerged miRNAs and functional properties arising from context relationships over terms The Impact of the Genomic Context on miRNA Expression and Function As any other gene the evolutionary processes that gives rise to new miRNAs mainly by duplication or de novo origin Berezikov Meunier et al takes place on certain regions of the genome that may overlap or not to preexisting gene loci In a recent study Meunier et al showed that all vertebrate species analyzed Platypus Opossum Mouse Macaque and have a significant excess of intragenic miRNAs with on average of them overlapping to introns Curiously the proportions of intronic miRNAs are even higher for those of recent origin suggesting that introns are hotspots for new miRNA origination Moreover the transcriptional orientation of intragenic miRNAs is highly biased toward the same strand orientation of their host genes Rodriguez et al et al Meunier et al Hinske et al Given the large size of vertebrate genomes why do miRNAs apparently have such preference to emerge in intragenic regions Which evidences support the role of natural selection shaping this pattern and what advantages miRNAs might take from such genomic organization To address these questions et al investigated the patterns of emergence and expression of human miRNAs along the vertebrate evolution considering the evolutionary origin of their host genes i e whether miRNAs are intergenic mapped to old genes before fish and tetrapods or to young genes after the Similar to previous studies Iwama et al it was shown that most human miRNAs have a relatively recent origin emerging in the primate order Though an interesting pattern was revealed the majority of those young miRNAs are intragenic and preferentially embedded within old host genes even when controlled by host gene length intronic and expression level Expression breadth analyses showed that young miRNAs hosted by old genes were more broadly expressed in more than their intergenic counterparts On the other hand miRNAs hosted by young genes showed a bias to expression when compared to the intergenic ones or those within old genes The same conclusions held when a very stringent miRNA annotation provided by Fromm et al was considered since several miRBase entries do not represent bonafide miRNAs Chiang et al Taylor et al Fromm et al It is well established that expression breadth is negatively correlated with evolutionary rates Wolf et al Park and Choi meaning that overall conserved genes are highly and broadly expressed whereas less conserved genes tend to have low and narrow expression What turns out is that the expression of intragenic miRNAs is tightly coupled to their genomic environment especially in regard to the evolutionary ages of their host genes In a mechanistic way this is clearly connected with the of gene pairs by shared regulatory elements a very event Baskerville and Bartel Ozsolak et al Marsico et al Hence the maintenance of miRNAs embedded in genic regions may be indicative of some evolutionary constraint since young and older intragenic miRNAs are biased toward host gene sense orientation as well as preferential emergence within old host genes In addition same age miRNAs show differential expression breadth depending on their genomic context a pattern that is maintained not only during recent g but also over longer periods Such pattern is observed for miRNAs originated in amniotes g or in placental mammals g presenting higher or lower expression breadth depending on the age of their host genes et al In particular for young intragenic miRNAs being hosted by old genes could be beneficial at least during an initial adaptive phase because of the expression broadness achieved through a presumably favorable transcriptional environment Instead of readily relying on the settlement of their own regulatory apparatus young miRNAs would initially been benefited by their regulatory elements albeit they may acquire independent regulation afterward et al Supporting this notion it has been suggested that young and intragenic miRNAs are more likely to be regulated by shared promoters whereas old miRNAs are frequently regulated by their independent intronic promoters Marsico et al In addition as old host genes provide higher expression breadth for those young miRNAs it would in principle increase the opportunities for new target interactions in different tissues From such perspective the host transcriptional environment could facilitate the initial expression of young miRNAs and thereafter contribute to the process of miRNA functionalization The location of a gene in the genome is clearly related to its expression as revealed by transgene insertion experiments et al and global expression analyses of gene neighborhoods Caron et al Purmann et al Michalak Nevertheless some of the observed expression changes in gene vicinity may not be subjected to selection but rather it would be a consequence of expression changes in a close gene under strong selection Recently Ghanbarian and Hurst demonstrated that expression changes in humans relative to the common ancestor coordinately drive changes in expression of the neighbors of a focal gene and that this effect is stronger as the distance between genes are shorter Therefore the genomic context still may yield important effects on the expression and perhaps the fixation of novel miRNAs that are not under direct selection Evolutionary Conservation and Novelties From Genomic Context The phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs in vertebrates is distinguished by the presence of deeply conserved and abundant clade or repertoires Berezikov et al Wheeler et al Meunier et al Fromm et al Although the evolution of miRNA sequences have been investigated Lyu et al Ninova et al the conserved patterns and evolutionary innovations that arose due to interspecific differences in the genomic context are largely underexplored One of the few studies to address this issue compared the genomic location and expression of miRNAs during developmental stages of medaka fish zebrafish chicken and mouse Ason et al It was demonstrated that spatial expression differences can be related to changes either in the miRNA location and copy number variation rather than to sequence divergence Ason et al Actually the miRNA genomic location is thought to influence their expression divergence as and intragenic miRNAs tend to be more similarly expressed among species than intergenic ones et al Such kind of expression constraint linked to a conserved genomic context is clearly observed for and its host gene et al Homologous sequences of are found across amniotes with identical mature sequences from human to chicken Gene order and location of in the second intron of are also preserved Figure Although is annotated as intergenic in chicken predicted transcripts with an intron overlapping are annotated Expression analyses reveal a strongly conserved pattern among human rhesus macaque mouse and indicating concomitant expression of and Shen et al with highest abundance in heart Figure The host gene is a muscarinic cholinergic receptor involved in cardiac chronotropic and inotropic of muscle effects Brodde and Michel and it has been associated with cardiomyopathy Zhang et al Notably dysregulation of is also reported in cardiac disease Cooley et al and is involved with proliferation of human coronary artery smooth cells Sun et al suggesting an important functional connection between and FIGURE Genomic context conservation of intragenic miRNAs The human embedded within reveals a highly conserved pattern in terms of sequence and expression Alignments from the UCSC genome browser indicate the preservation of throughout amniotes with few differing bases blue and identical mature sequences base scores indicate strong purifying selection on this region and are with highest levels in heart a pattern conserved in other species The human encoded within has homologous sequences only in primates The expression of follows its host pattern with higher levels in brain and cerebellum possibly reflecting rapid evolution Expression of in rhesus was not detected Expression data were obtained from Brawand et al and Meunier et al and processed in et al Tissues are heart brain cerebellum kidney and testis As mentioned earlier the transcriptional environment of host genes may act as a key factor to promote the expression of newly emerged miRNAs This phenomenon is well illustrated by the encoded within Figure This host gene is a fucosyltransferase throughout animals Costache et al Juliant et al that catalyzes fucosylation of glycoproteins which is essential for activating growth factor receptors Liu et al while its deletion has lethal effects in mice Wang et al is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues Mele et al and seems to follow its host expression pattern Figure Considering the young evolutionary age of its expression levels and breadth are unusually high thus being frequently altered in different types of cancer Zhou et al Zheng et al It is interesting that has emerged as a promising predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer Verma et al Rasmussen et al exhibiting strong association with oxaliplatin chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal resistance Rasmussen et al Another singular feature of miRNAs is their frequent occurrence in clusters originated through tandem or duplications or by de novo mutations either in introns or intergenic regions Berezikov Such genomic organization is prone to greatly affect the evolution of newly emerged miRNAs According to Wang et al members of the same cluster tend to exhibit coordinated expression and to target overlapping sets of genes The authors proposed that clustering arrangement and by developing functions related to the miRNAs in the same cluster would help the initial survival of these young miRNAs until the cluster is settled up by purifying selection Otherwise the most usual fate of de novo newly emerged miRNAs would to undergo rapid degeneration In further support of this model clustered young miRNAs indeed present significant signs of adaptive changes that probably drive them to functional constraints associated with the older members of the cluster Wang et al Interactions Functional and Evolutionary Implications If a recently emerged miRNA is expressed and integrated into regulatory networks through consistent and biologically relevant target interactions it will have more chances to become functional and be retained afterward over long periods Chen and Rajewsky Lyu et al Therefore young miRNAs originated in a genomic context able to boost their expression in multiple tissues would favor target recognition This idea is consistent with the previous observation that young miRNAs emerged within old host genes are expressed in more tissues and tend to have more predicted targets compared to young intergenic ones et al We therefore suggested a miRNA evolution model that takes into account not only the miRNAs themselves but also their genomic context et al Figure Hence young miRNAs hosted by old genes would gain higher expression breadth benefited by their transcriptional activity thus enabling many target interactions that at first glance are mostly neutral Chen and Rajewsky Nozawa et al but could be stabilized by natural selection over time On the other hand as young intergenic miRNAs tend to have narrower expression and apparently less targets to interact with they could undergo faster degeneration Figure This degeneration scenario is also most likely to happen with miRNAs emerged within young hosts because of their general expression signature et al FIGURE Model of miRNA evolution Young miRNAs emerged within old genes are expressed in more tissues and therefore could interact with diverse set of targets possibly enhancing the chances of functionalization and fixation through time In contrast as young intergenic miRNAs tend to be expressed in very limited target interactions could contribute to their faster degeneration Evolutionary sequence conservation has been successfully introduced to reduce the number of and to increase the ratio in target predictions Instead of helping identifying conserved pathways and relationships among miRNAs and their targets Hausser and Zavolan this requirement comes with a drawback since it can only be applied to miRNAs and target genes that have conservation data available and which are not Indeed a recent study demonstrated that target sites identified by immunoprecipitation data are rarely conserved between distantly related species but extensive conservation is observed between closely related ones Xu et al Even when considering sites there is evidence of selective constraints compared to sites across the region suggesting that most of targets might be functional at least for a short evolutionary period A striking example of this condition is the target site for in the of the transcription factor whose regulation altered phenotypes such as proliferation and migration in a manner McLoughlin et al Despite of the recent advances on the characterization of operating mechanisms that guide interactions we are only on the verge of understanding how newly emerged miRNAs in different genomic contexts are integrated into regulatory networks as well as how their novel target interactions contribute to phenotypic plasticity Population Biology Perspective for the Genome Architecture of miRNAs Population biology studies at the genome level have been proved to be promising tools enhancing our understanding on how genetic elements are interconnected spatially and temporally et al Sudmant et al Most of miRNA population studies have focused on the impact of single nucleotide variants localized inside the seed and the mature regions to analyze conservation patterns target diversification and differential disease susceptibility g Barbash et al et al Gallego et al Except for few studies of miRNA expression quantitative trait loci g Huan et al the evolution of miRNA genomic architecture has not been deeply investigated using a population biology framework It is still unknown if variation in miRNAs sequence expression and target sites across populations are more relevant for uncovering the mechanisms of phenotypic evolution and disease than other genetic variation On one hand due to its folded structure and small size miRNAs are more likely to emerge de novo than novel protein coding genes Berezikov Diversification of miRNA target repertoire may be more prone to appear as result of simple sequence modifications such as direct mutation seed or hairpin shifting and arm switching Berezikov Therefore variation on sites indeed can lead to phenotypic innovation as exemplified by the lineage diversification of cichlid fishes Loh et al Franchini et al On the other hand as target mRNAs can be regulated subtly by several miRNAs detecting phenotypical effects by population variation seems to be harder than for genetic variation in regulatory or coding regions Indeed most of single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in the creation of novel miRNA target sites does not correlate with phenotypic differences among humans Saunders et al Nonetheless it is possible that genomic comparisons of different individuals can give insights on the origination process of miRNAs as previously done for other genetic elements Hatcher For instance the basis of retrogene origination in metazoans has been recently deciphered through Drosophila population data Flanking regions signatures of polymorphic retrocopies revealed that long terminal repeat retrotransposons have mediate their formation Tan et al miRNAs are mostly originated de novo or by duplication Meunier et al but mechanistic details on how those processes occur are still unknown Population genomics might help uncover those components through the identification of mutational signatures attached to polymorphic miRNAs that are usually erased by time and throughout their fixation In addition comparing fixed patterns present in different species to polymorphic states observed in a group of individuals are useful tools for contrasting genomic features driven by natural selection to patterns produced by mutation bias Long et al Notable this type of comparison helped to support the hypothesis in which natural selection drives retrogene duplication from the X chromosome to the autosomes in Drosophila and humans Schrider et al Navarro and Galante Therefore the analyses of different human populations can give further support to the adapted pattern of miRNAs organized inside old protein coding host genes Furthermore as miRNAs expression and targeting has been shown to be implicated in a wide of human diseases Mendell and Olson seed and mature region variants found among ethnic populations become clinically important et al More specifically there are distinct miRNA profiles in diseases between African and European descendants g Huang et al Heegaard et al which could be responsible for differences among those populations in susceptibility to diseases drug sensitiveness and biomarker diagnostics et al Therefore should worth investigating if ethnic group variation on miRNA genomic context have also significant role in human health From the discussion above it turns out that the genomic context as an outcome of natural selection imposes evolutionary constraints to maintain the structural and functional integrity of its genetic elements Moreover it can also propel the evolutionary fate of new elements that arise in a suitable environment eventually accelerating the process of functionalization Therefore evolutionary models tackling the chromatin organization will be of extreme value to pursue the general principles that afford those processes

associated with leafy green vegetables are becoming a growing concern A better understanding of the behavior of VTEC particularly serotypes on lettuce under stress conditions is necessary for designing more effective control strategies Hydrogen peroxide O can be used as a sanitizer to reduce the microbial load in leafy green vegetables particularly in fresh produce destined for the organic market In this study we tested the hypothesis that H O treatment of contaminated lettuce affects in the same manner transcription of and virulence genes in VTEC strains representing and serotypes Six VTEC isolates representing serotypes NM NM and were included in this study The results indicate that mM H O caused a population reduction of log to control in all six VTEC strains present on romaine lettuce Following the treatment the transcription of genes related to oxidative stress oxyR and sodA general stress uspA and rpoS starvation phoA acid stress gadA gadB and gadW and virulence and fliC were dramatically downregulated in all six VTEC serotypes P compared to not treated control samples Therefore VTEC and serotypes on lettuce showed similar survival rates and gene transcription profiles in response to mM H O treatment Thus the results derived from this study provide a basic understanding of the influence of H O treatment on the survival and virulence of VTEC and serotypes on lettuce Escherichia coli serotypes lettuce decontamination hydrogen peroxide treatment gene transcription Agriculture and Canada Introduction Escherichia coli also referred to as Shiga toxin E coli often cause diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome Croxen et al Karpman and Stahl Karmali Although VTEC serotype is commonly identified in human diseases serogroups have been increasingly associated with serious outbreaks and were recently responsible for more than of STEC illness in U S et al Parsons et al CDC In the incidence of confirmed VTEC infections was higher than in Huang et al More than of infections linked to VTEC were caused by serotypes and the Top Saito et al Brooks et al Folster et al Bradley et al Brown et al In enteroaggregative E coli caused the biggest outbreak in Germany This strain produces and is one of the most virulent strains of VTEC Buchholz et al Zangari et al Karmali Fresh leafy green vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet due to their richness in minerals vitamins and phytochemicals However leafy green vegetables can be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria such as VTEC during growth harvesting and transportation leading to subsequent illnesses and outbreaks Wachtel et al Solomon et al Islam et al Delaquis et al A number of surveys have shown an increase in foodborne outbreaks linked to contaminated leafy green vegetables Harris et al Sivapalasingam et al Rangel et al Lynch et al Painter et al Herman et al Although the contamination can be minimized by preventing produce exposure to sources of pathogenic bacteria including contaminated water soil and animals the occasional contamination of leafy green vegetables on farms by VTEC can still occur which leads to contaminated produce entering the processing lines Olaimat and Holley Therefore effectively reducing the contamination during processing is crucial to ensure the safety of fresh leafy green vegetables Chlorine has been widely used as a sanitizer to reduce the microbial load in vegetables Beuchat et al However chlorine may react to form potentially carcinogenic or mutagenic products Hurst In addition the formed when sodium hypochlorite sanitizer commonly used in the fresh produce reacts with organic compounds have been shown to increase the risk of bladder cancer Villanueva et al Hydrogen peroxide O is a potential alternative to chlorine treatment and breaks down to ecologically friendly water and oxygen Linley et al In addition H O has been approved for use in organic postharvest processing systems As such this sanitizer could be used for decontamination of fresh produce destined for organic market To date several studies have been conducted on the gene expression in pure culture of E coli under oxidative stress Wang et al Allen and Griffiths Mei et al In addition using H O as a sanitizer on fresh produce to reduce E coli was investigated Sapers et al Huang et al However the survival and gene transcription of VTEC serotypes under stress conditions on lettuce remain largely unknown In this study the behaviors of and VTEC serotypes in response to H O treatment on lettuce were evaluated Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions Six VTEC strains were tested in this study E coli NM and NM E coli was included in the present study because it is prototype strain Serotypes and are predominant serotypes worldwide therefore strains representing these serotypes have been investigated in this study In addition VTEC isolated from German outbreak was selected because this strain is highly virulent and is linked to fresh produce outbreak All the strains except were of human origin E coli was isolated from raw hamburger meat linked to an outbreak of HC Further details regarding these strains have been published previously Mei et al E coli possesses genes encoding and intimin gene eae and flagellin gene fliC VTEC and do not have genes VTEC strains NM and NM do not have genes encoding and flagellin Enteroaggregative E coli strain does not possess genes encoding and intimin For simplicity VTEC strains will be referred to by their serotype as each strain has its distinct serotype All the strains were grown in Tryptic soy broth at with shaking for h Subsequently mL of h culture of each VTEC strain was inoculated into mL TSB and incubated for h at with shaking The bacterial cells in logarithmic phase were collected washed twice with sterile distilled water and used to inoculate lettuce samples Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment of Contaminated Lettuce Romaine lettuce was purchased from a local grocery store in Guelph The outer leaves were removed and the remaining leaves were cut into cm slices grams of the leaves were weighed placed into sterile polyethylene stomacher bags and inoculated with mL of bacterial suspension CFU The leaves were massaged for min to distribute the bacterial suspension evenly on the leaves Subsequently mL of H O was added to the bag to achieve a final concentration of mM The negative control sample contained lettuce leaves with mL of autoclaved distilled water and mL H O The control sample contained mL of bacterial suspension and mL of autoclaved distilled water The bags were incubated at room temperature for min After incubation mL of culture was taken from each stomacher bag and serially diluted with buffered peptone water Subsequently of each dilution was spread on cefixime MacConkey agar plates in duplicate The plates were incubated for h at and the CFU mL was calculated Additionally mL samples from controls and each stomacher bag treated with mM H O were collected for RNA extraction RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis Bacterial cells were concentrated by centrifugation before RNA extraction After taking samples from controls and each stomacher bag treated with mM H O each mL sample was added to mL of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent The samples were centrifuged for min at g and supernatants were decanted prior to RNA extraction RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit Mississauga ON following the instructions for bacteria Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from each RNA preparation using the Turbo TM kit Cambridge according to the instructions for DNase treatments Total RNA concentration was determined using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop Subsequently of RNA was using SuperScript III Carlsbad CA according to the instructions A no reverse transcriptase control was included for each RNA sample PCR All and virulence genes tested in this study are described in Table Transcription

Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix U AmpErase Uracil N Applied of each primer and water All primers used in the study were previously described Mei et al Amplification and detection were carried out on a Multiplex Quantitative PCR System La Jolla CA with an initial temperature of for min Following denaturation at for min reactions were cycled times as follows amplification at for s annealing at for s extension at for s Subsequent melt curve analysis involved heating the products to for min followed by cooling to for s and heating to while monitoring fluorescence No template control and No RT were included for each assay and no Ct values were obtained for all negative controls after cycles of PCR not Several candidate reference genes including rRNA tufA B mdh pyrC gatB recA serC frr rpsU udp mdoG rpoA and arcA were tested for expression stability as previously described Mei et al Only rRNA gene expression was stable in all VTEC strains on lettuce under experimental conditions Therefore rRNA was used as reference gene in this study to normalize the data Serial dilutions of the cDNA template were examined with rRNA primers Using dilutions the Ct value was around and with other primers for different target genes all the Ct values were between and Therefore dilutions of cDNA samples were used in the experiment Table List of and virulence genes tested for differential gene

following exposure to H O were analyzed using ANOVA Results Treatment of contaminated lettuce with mM H O for min reduced the populations of all VTEC strains tested in this study by log Table The

stress oxyR and sodA universal stress uspA and rpoS starvation phoA acid stress gadB and gadW and virulence and fliC were significantly P downregulated after exposure to mM H O The gadA gene was downregulated and the expression of soxR was below the detectable level Interestingly two genes related to cold shock cspC and cspE were significantly P upregulated Genes related to starvation dps cold shock cspA and mismatch repair mutS were also upregulated Figure In the case of E coli on lettuce H O treatment caused significant P downregulation of genes related to oxidative stress oxyR and sodA general stress rpoS acid resistance gadA gadB and gadW and virulence and fliC The uspA gene was also downregulated Transcription of dps cspC and mutS was significantly P upregulated In addition gene encoding cold shock protein cspE was upregulated Figure In E coli NM present on lettuce genes related to oxidative damage sodA general stress uspA and rpoS starvation phoA acid resistance gadA and gadW and virulence were significantly P downregulated The soxR and gadB genes were also downregulated Only two genes dps and cspE were significantly P upregulated Furthermore genes encoding cold shock protein cspC MMR sensor mutS and intimin eae were upregulated Figure In E coli NM on lettuce nine genes responsible for oxidative damage oxyR and sodA general stress uspA and rpoS starvation phoA acid resistance gadA gadB and gadW and virulence were significantly P downregulated Whereas genes for cold shock cspC and MMR mutS were significantly P upregulated Figure In E coli present on lettuce out of genes including genes associated with oxidative damage oxyR and sodA general stress uspA and rpoS starvation phoA acid resistance gadA gadB and gadW and virulence eae and fliC were significantly P downregulated Three genes dps cspC and cspE were significantly P upregulated In addition genes for cold shock cspA and DNA damage repair mutS were upregulated Figure In E coli on lettuce genes related to oxidative stress oxyR and sodA general stress rpoS starvation phoA acid resistance gadW and virulence and fliC were significantly P downregulated In addition two genes associated with acid gadA and gadB as well as uspA gene were downregulated Interestingly soxR and cspC were significantly P upregulated Genes encoding cold shock protein cspA and cspE and intimin eae were also upregulated Figure Overall most of the genes associated with stress and virulence were downregulated in and serotypes on lettuce treated with mM H O Only three genes associated with cold shock cspC and cspE and MMR mutS were upregulated in all VTEC strains tested Figures Discussion The effect of H O on the survival on lettuce of six VTEC strains representing NM NM and serotypes was investigated in this study A population reduction of log was observed for all VTEC strains on lettuce following treatment with mM H O Table A previous study in our laboratory using the same VTEC strains suspended in TSB reported greater sensitivity to H O For instance treatment of pure broth culture of VTEC with mM H O resulted in a log reduction and mM H O caused a log reduction in population of E coli Tang and Kostrzynska Therefore the results derived from these studies demonstrate that H O treatment is less effective in lettuce decontamination compared to its effect on reducing VTEC populations in pure cultures Previous investigations showed that several factors such as organic loads of produce Gonzalez et al or wash Nou and Luo and leaf age Brandl and Amundson can influence the efficacy of sanitizer to inactivate E coli on fresh produce These studies indicate that the lettuce leaves may help to protect bacteria making it harder to eliminate pathogens from lettuce Indeed bacterial cells on lettuce may be physically sequestered from H O exposure In addition organic molecules released by lettuce will react with H O and therefore reduce the effective exposure to H O Therefore in order to choose an effective treatment to reduce the pathogens on leafy greens it is important to understand the behavior of bacteria on lettuce under different stress conditions To get a better understanding of the response to H O treatment in different VTEC serotypes in the present study the transcription of genes related to stress and virulence in and serotypes on lettuce was evaluated Different gene transcription profiles following exposure to H O were observed in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures Mei et al H O caused dramatic downregulation of and virulence genes in VTEC strains present on lettuce including and serotypes Ten genes were downregulated in all six VTEC strains on lettuce Figures However only three genes were upregulated These genes belong to different regulation systems in E coli and respond to various environmental conditions by adjusting behavior accordingly to protect cells from damaging System Response oxyR sodA and soxR Superoxide dismutases and catalases are employed by E coli to respond to superoxide and peroxide stress There are three SODs including MnSOD sodA FeSOD and CuZnSOD and two catalases and HPII encoded by katG and katE in E coli These SODs and catalase genes are regulated by two major oxidative stress regulons OxyR and SoxRS Chiang and Schellhorn In the presence of oxidative stress OxyR can sense H O and be converted to the oxidized form subsequently activating transcription of the OxyR regulon genes such as katG dps and oxyR which protect the cell from H O toxicity Storz et al Farr and Kogoma Chiang and Schellhorn In this study the transcription of oxyR was downregulated in all VTEC strains Figures this may cause a reduction in catalase expression increasing peroxide sensitivity SoxRS is another key regulon triggered under oxidative stress in E coli It is positively regulated by agents such as paraquat and constitutes a regulatory system in which SoxR activated as a transcriptional activator induces the expression of soxS and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein regulate the transcription of the various genes important for responding to oxidative stress Demple and Nunoshiba et al Chiang and Schellhorn The genes controlled by soxRS include sodA nfo repair endonuclease micF regulator of ompF and zwf Christman et al Greenberg et al Tsaneva and Weiss In the present study following exposure of VTEC strains on lettuce to mM H O the transcription of soxR in E coli slightly increased whereas the transcription of soxR decreased to below the detectable level in Therefore SodA reduction may be attributed to the reduction or only slight induction of soxR Manchado et al reported that the expression of genes katG and dps were induced when the concentration of H O was from to while the higher concentration H O resulted in the upregulation of soxS and sodA That study suggests that the expression of oxyR or soxRS is In addition downregulation of soxR was also observed in VTEC broth cultures exposed to oxidative stress Mei et al however the transcription of sodA was significantly P increased in pure cultures of all VTEC strains The inconsistent results of expression of soxR and sodA may indicate that sodA can react to superoxide stress SoxRS is not the sole regulator of sodA gene General Stress Response uspA and rpoS and Cold Shock Response cspA cspC and cspE Escherichia coli contains a large CspA family consisting of nine homologous cold inducible proteins CspA to CspI among which CspA is the major one produced at and is negatively downregulated by cspC Whereas CspC and CspE are constitutively produced at and are not temperature regulated Yamanaka et al Etchegaray et al Phadtare and Inouye It has been reported that CspC and CspE are important regulators of the expression of RpoS a global stress response regulator and UspA u niversal s tress p rotein A responding to various general stresses Nystrom and Neidhardt In addition genes such as dps and katG are upregulated or downregulated by the overexpression or deletion of cspC and cspE Phadtare and Inouye Phadtare et al Therefore CspC and CspE play important roles in the stress response of E coli Upregulation of cspC and cspE in all six VTEC strains on lettuce was observed in the present study Figures However uspA and rpoS were downregulated and a minor change in the transcription of dps was observed Interestingly the transcription of cspC was downregulated in broth cultures of all VTEC strains exposed to mM H O at Mei et al On the other hand in the present study cspC was upregulated in VTEC strains on lettuce treated with mM H O at room temperature Previous investigation showed that CspC and CspE cannot be induced under some stress conditions like M NaCl M KCl ethanol pH pH temperature of or Phadtare and Inouye It is possible that a different concentration of H O used for lettuce decontamination as well as environmental factors such as H O released from lettuce leaves as well as nutrients present in lettuce samples and natural microbiota contributed to the induction of cspC and cspE More interestingly contrary results of transcription of cspC and cspE observed in response to H O treatment of VTEC pure cultures and in the same strains present on lettuce suggest that VTEC may react to the same stress differently in different environments However it is not possible to rule out that induction of cold stress genes in present study was more of the effect of temperature change combined with peroxide treatment Centrifugation of bacterial cells using refrigerated centrifuge following VTEC exposure on lettuce to H O could influence transcription of cold shock genes Further studies are required to gain a better understanding of the stress conditions that affect the cspC and cspE gene transcription in VTEC present on lettuce Starvation Stress Response phoA and dps The gene phoA encoding alkaline phosphatase was induced under a condition but was not synthesized in normal growth medium Han and Lee The phoA is a member of pho regulon regulated by a system et al The phoA was significantly downregulated in all the VTEC strains on lettuce tested in this study Figures Furthermore downregulation of phoA was observed in most VTEC strains when pure cultures were treated with H O Mei et al Therefore further studies are needed to test if H O treatment changes the sensitivity of VTEC strains to condition The H O can cause lethality of the bacterial cells through several mechanisms It has been proposed that the primary cause of cell inactivation by H O or other oxidative agents is DNA damage Storz et al Thus it is important for the cells to cope with stresses by inducing the production of a variety of DNA repair enzymes as well as catalases Glutathione also acts to protect cells from oxidative stress In addition D NA binding p rotein from s tarved cells protects cells during environmental stresses including oxidative stress and nutritional deprivation Almiron et al Calhoun and Kwon Dps protects cells from harmful oxidative radicals by DNA binding iron storage and by binding and oxidizing Fe ions at ferroxidase centers Furthermore Dps may regulate the expression of DNA repair enzymes and catalases necessary for stress resistance Zheng et al reported that the expression of dps considerably increased when the cells were exposed to mM H O for min However only minor upregulation of dps was observed in this study for most of VTEC strains on lettuce Figures Mismatch Repair Response mutS MutS is a member of MMR system which helps to maintain chromosome stability in E coli MutS binds to the mismatches and initiates the MMR on daughter DNA strands Modrich and Lahue Schofield and Hsieh MMR has also been shown to be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage which causes spontaneous lesion or Michaels and Miller Tchou and Grollman Lu et al Studies have shown that the amount of MutS in E coli remarkably decreased when cells were in the stationary phase and under starvation stress and the expression of MutS repair protein was negatively regulated by the RpoS and Hfq global regulators Feng et al Tsui et al Li et al In the present study mutS was upregulated following exposure of VTEC on lettuce to H O Figures This upregulation may be caused by significantly downregulated expression of RpoS which is a negative regulator of mutS Acid Response gadA gadB and gadW pathogenic E coli must be able to survive in the extremely acidic environment of the stomach and resist very low pH for several hours Peterson et al Previous studies have shown that a total of genes comprise an acid fitness island including a glutamate decarboxylase system and three transcriptional regulators GadX and of the GAD enzymes which renders E coli the ability to survive strong acidic stress Hommais et al Ma et al Bergholz et al Mates et al E coli produce two isozymes of GAD encoded by the gadA and gadB genes which are induced by GadX at any pH while GadW represses expression of gadX GadW activates the expression of gadA and gadB only in the absence of GadX Ma et al Tucker et al In addition it has been reported that the expression of gadA and gadBC were induced when bacteria were cultured in acidified medium treated with acetate and during entry into stationary phase Selinger et al Arnold et al Tucker et al However the expression of regulators GadX and GadW under the same conditions were unknown In the present study gadA gadB and gadW were significantly downregulated in all six VTEC strains on lettuce Figures We suspect that the expression of gadX was also downregulated in response to H O which subsequently resulted in the downregulation of gadA and gadB Furthermore the results indicate that following H O treatment VTEC on lettuce may become more sensitive to acid stress which decreases the viability of pathogens under low pH Virulence Factors by eae and fliC Production of Stx is the definitive virulence factor of VTEC and serotypes Croxen et al Scheutz Smith et al Franz et al Stx produced by VTEC can be classified into two types and There are three subtypes of c and seven subtypes of b c d e f Although both toxins could cause bloody diarrhea and HUS a specific subset of subtypes and have a higher association with HC and HUS than subtypes or other subtypes Scheutz Stx are encoded on bacteriophage genomes that are integrated into bacterial chromosome As such the biology of the phages influences the expression of and Production and release of toxins depend on induction of these bacteriophages Croxen et al Scheutz Amongst the VTEC strains tested in this study E coli produced both and E coli produced only and the remaining four strains produced only In this study both and genes were dramatically downregulated in all VTEC strains on lettuce following exposure to H O Figures Many VTEC strains produce attaching and effacing lesions which are controlled by the locus of enterocyte effacement Croxen et al Scheutz Although AE lesions are not essential for bloody diarrhea and HUS the majority of strains implicated in these syndromes are Intimin encoded by eae E coli attaching and gene is responsible for intimate adhesion of VTEC to the intestinal epithelium and formation of AE lesions Intimin binds to the cell receptor Tir which is translocated by the pathogen to the enterocyte via a type III secretion system Croxen et al The presence of eae gene is strongly correlated to the presence of genes encoding many other virulence factors Franz et al In addition VTEC strains with eae and genes have been associated with HUS and bloody diarrhea Scheutz In the present study the transcription of eae for E coli which is changed only slightly following H O treatment Figures Thus further studies about eae regulation and the virulence of VTEC strains under different stress conditions are needed Production of flagella is another contributor to the pathogenicity of VTEC Gyles Flagella are mainly responsible for motility chemotaxis and secretion of virulence factors The key structural component of the flagellum filament is encoded by the fliC gene In our studies the transcription of fliC was dramatically downregulated in all four motile VTEC strains on lettuce treated with H O Figures In addition fliC was downregulated in pure broth cultures exposed to H O Mei et al These results suggest that H O treatment affects motility of VTEC strains Conclusion H O treatment caused less dramatic reduction in VTEC populations on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures which indicates that VTEC are protected from H O on leafy greens Consequently higher concentration of H O or other sanitizers are required to reduce and eliminate VTEC on lettuce As such the results derived from this study showed the importance of food matrix in studying the effect of sanitizers on survival rate of VTEC In addition VTEC strains on lettuce showed similar transcription patterns of in response to treatment with mM H O The transcription of genes related to oxidative stress general stress acid stress and some virulence genes were significantly downregulated in six VTEC serotypes Consequently VTEC strains on lettuce may become more sensitive to acid stress following H O treatment Interestingly different gene transcription patterns in response to H O were observed in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to pure broth cultures Mei et al Particularly sodA gene encoding manganese SOD was significantly upregulated in pure cultures of all VTEC serotypes however this gene was downregulated in the same strains present on lettuce In addition Stx genes were upregulated in broth culture of E coli and downregulated in most VTEC serotypes on lettuce following H O treatment It is possible that factors released from lettuce leaves and natural microbiota present in lettuce samples contributed to different gene transcription patterns in VTEC strains on lettuce compared to broth cultures Author Contributions All authors have made substantial direct and

progressive muscle paralysis determined by the degeneration of motoneurons in the motor cortex brainstem and spinal cord The ALS pathogenetic mechanisms are still unclear despite the wealth of studies demonstrating the involvement of several altered signaling pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction glutamate excitotoxicity oxidative stress and neuroinflammation To date the proposed therapeutic strategies are targeted to one or a few of these alterations resulting in only a minimal effect on disease course and survival of ALS patients The involvement of different mechanisms in ALS pathogenesis underlines the need for a therapeutic approach targeted to multiple aspects Mesenchymal stem cells can support motoneurons and surrounding cells reduce inflammation stimulate tissue regeneration and release growth factors On this basis MSC have been proposed as promising candidates to treat ALS However due to the drawbacks of cell therapy the possible therapeutic use of extracellular vesicles released by stem cells is raising increasing interest The present review summarizes the main pathological mechanisms involved in ALS and the related therapeutic approaches proposed to date focusing on MSC therapy and their preclinical and clinical applications Moreover the nature and characteristics of EVs and their role in recapitulating the effect of stem cells are discussed elucidating how and why these vesicles could provide novel opportunities for ALS treatment amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS therapeutic applications mesenchymal stem cells extracellular vesicles exosomes Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease first described by the neurobiologist Charcot in the and which became initially known as sclerosis In the USA the disease is also known as Lou Gehrig disease in honor of the baseball player who developed the disease in the ALS has an incidence of and a prevalence of in Europe and de Carvalho making it the most common motoneuron disease in human adults and Rothstein In of cases there is no apparent genetic link ALS while the remaining of cases have a family history ALS In general the first symptoms appear at the mean age of years for fALS and years for sALS even if the onset can occur in very young individuals or in elderly people and de Carvalho The disease is more common in males than in females with an incidence of et al although the incidence in men and women is about the same in fALS The disease is fatal within years after clinical about of patients die within months from symptom onset while about of patients may survive for more than a decade et al del Aguila et al Both sALS and fALS are characterized by selective degeneration of both upper motoneurons in the primary motor cortex and lower motoneurons in the brainstem and spinal cord However some groups of motoneurons including those that control pelvic muscles nucleus in the sacral spinal and eye movements are spared by the pathology The reasons of this differential motoneuron vulnerability remain unknown et al The familial and sporadic forms of the disease appear clinically indistinguishable Although the motoneuron degeneration is the main hallmark of the disease ALS can be classified according to the district of symptom onset Limb onset is the most common presentation of ALS with progressive muscle weakness and wasting body weight loss fasciculations emotional lability and cognitive dysfunction In the bulbar onset representing approximately of ALS cases the disease starts with difficulties in speech and swallowing and followed by limb symptoms et al In sALS the occurrence of the disease could be also due to a sALS has been associated with genes that may trigger the cascade of neurodegeneration interacting with environmental risk factors Susceptibility genes could also play a role in fALS et al Mutations in susceptibility genes could potentially contribute to the development of the disease only in the presence of other genetic or environmental factors In persons with a susceptibility genotype the exposure to specific environmental risk factors may increase the risk for the disease Concerning genetic predisposition epigenetics and in particular defects in histone homeostasis and have been implicated in ALS Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases catalyze acetylation and deacetylation respectively of histone proteins Lys residues The interplay between HATs and HDACs alters the net balance of histone acetylation levels thereby remodeling chromatin structure as indicated by transcriptional dysregulation that occurs in both ALS murine models and patients et al Although a role of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of ALS has been documented it remains to be clarified whether the involved epigenetic alterations could be related to environmental factors Among the risk factors for ALS lifestyle including smoking and dietary factors and physical activity have been hypothesized In particular some ALS patients have a higher level of physical fitness and a lower body mass index compared with healthy controls Turner Moreover environmental risk factors combined with working conditions workers carpenters farm workers laboratory technicians and could potentially increase the risk for ALS due to exposure to heavy metals solvents pesticides and chemicals which could contribute to trigger ALS pathogenetic mechanisms et al In a geographical area which includes part of Japan Guam Kii Peninsula of Japan and Guinea the prevalence of the disease is times higher than in any other part of the world This increased incidence is ascribed to exposure to a neurotoxic amino acid as indicated by the higher concentration of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord tissues of ALS patients than in healthy controls et al Viral infections have also been considered as a potential risk factor for ALS exposure to viruses such as enterovirus herpesvirus and retrovirus may play an important role in the disease as reported in studies of blood serum muscle and brain tissue of ALS patients In these tissues a significant increase of the expression of the virus and the ability to form particles were revealed et al Oluwole et al Alfahad and Nath Another important factor to consider is the relationship between ALS and other medical conditions Several studies suggest a strong association of head trauma metabolic diseases autoimmune pathology and neuroinflammation et al Turner et al Altogether these data point to a substantial impact of factors on ALS The identification and knowledge of these factors would be highly relevant for understanding the etiopathogenesis of the sporadic form of the disease in persons with a susceptibility genotype About of ALS is familial with a Mendelian pattern of inheritance ALS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or manner although in most affected families it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner Patients with fALS present an earlier age of onset compared to the sporadic form and the penetrance severity progression and duration of disease vary in different gene mutations and different mutations in the same gene et al More than gene mutations have been identified in fALS which include Cu Zn superoxide dismutase gene TAR protein fused in sarcoma translocated in sarcoma and ubiquitin et al It has been recently reported that the hexarepeat expansion in chromosome open reading frame is the most common inherited cause of fALS of et al Mutations in the gene were the first to be identified in ALS they occur in up to of fALS cases and in of sALS cases and to date more than mutations have been found et al Three different isoform of SOD metalloenzymes are encoded in the human genome the cytoplasmic Cu Zn SOD the mitochondrial Mn SOD and the extracellular Cu Zn SOD Each isoform is a product of distinct genes and has a distinct subcellular localization but all require metals for their activity and catalyze the same reaction the dismutation of toxic superoxide anion radical a reactive oxygen species with a single unpaired electron produced by cellular respiration into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide O The toxicity of H O is then removed by glutathione peroxidase or catalase which generates water and oxygen Therefore SODs enzymes provide an important antioxidant defense in cells exposed to oxygen and The human isoform whose gene is located on chromosome is a small gene consisting of five exons and four introns encoding for a homodimeric enzyme each monomer formed by amino acids which form eight antiparallel beta strands The protein contains one copper and one zinc atom the first is fundamental for activity while zinc plays a role in the structural stability of the enzyme et al The mutations can be localized on the beta strand determining structural protein instability or in the sites determining the lack of Cu and or Zn conformational dysfunction and alteration of protein interactions In both instances the destabilization of the structure can lead to the formation of aggregates et al The majority of mutations are associated with an autosomal dominant form of the disease and alanine at codon changed to valine and are the most commonly reported ALS mutations The mutation changed to is a rare mutation but is the most studied as it was the first to be used in a transgenic mouse model of the disease The is the most prevalent mutation in the USA and acid at codon changed to is the most common in Europe either dominant or recessive Gene mutations can cause a dominant gain of function resulting in an increase of activity with an excessive production of H O or in a dominant loss of function with a decrease in enzyme activity which results in insufficient degradation of ROS et al The main pathogenetic mechanisms involved in motoneuron degeneration in ALS and the main therapeutic strategies proposed to date are here summarized This review article also focuses on the application of mesenchymal stem cells as treatment for ALS reporting results obtained in in vivo models of the disease and in clinical trials Moreover extracellular vesicles as possible mediators of a therapeutic effect of stem cells will be discussed underlying their potential use for ALS treatment Pathogenetic Mechanisms in ALS The identification of molecular mechanisms by which motoneurons degenerate in ALS is crucial for understanding disease progression and for the development of new therapeutic approaches Although mutations have been linked to ALS since more than two decades the mechanisms underlying the mode of action of mutant and the subsequent neurodegeneration neurotoxicity are still unclear Several hypotheses have been proposed in this regards and it seems likely that the combination of mechanisms rather than a single mechanism contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS pointing to a multifactorial pathogenesis Figure Pathogenetic mechanisms involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis The pathophysiological mechanism of the disease appears to be multifactorial and several mechanisms contribute to neurodegeneration An increase of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the synaptic cleft due to the impairment of its uptake by astrocytes leads to an increased influx of Ca ions in the motoneurons The increased levels of Ca ions which in physiological conditions could be removed by mitochondria remain high in the cytoplasm due to mitochondrial dysfunction and can cause neurodegeneration through activation of Ca enzymatic pathways contributing to oxidative stress Mutant misfolding proteins as superoxide dismutase gene chromosome open reading frame TAR protein and fused in sarcoma form intercellular aggregates contribute to an increase of oxidative stress contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and could lead to the accumulation of neurofilaments and dysfunction of axonal transport Moreover activated astrocyte and microglia release inflammatory mediators and toxic factors contributing to neurotoxicity Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mitochondrial damage is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases Mitochondria are the most important organelles for energy production cellular respiration and calcium homeostasis Moreover they produce high level of ROS and play a key role in apoptosis opening the permeability transition pore and allowing the release of cytochrome c which leads to the activation of the caspase cascade For these reasons structural and biochemical alterations of mitochondria can be linked to many aspects of ALS pathogenesis Morphological alterations in mitochondria such as vacuolated and dilated organelle with disorganized cristae and membranes fragmented network and swelling were observed in spinal motoneurons and skeletal muscle of both sALS and fALS patients and in the murine model of the disease et al Sasaki and Iwata and Manfredi The formation of vacuoles is due to expansion of the mitochondrial intermembrane space and consequent distention of membranes et al Although the mitochondria have own SOD protein the cytoplasmic SOD protein is also present at low levels in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and in their matrix et al The deposit of misfolded mutant in mitochondria may alter the physiological function of these organelles in the cell metabolism Abnormal production of ATP and ROS dysfunction in energy homeostasis and calcium homeostasis alteration of apoptosis triggering as well as altered mitochondrial transport along axons have been reported in ALS transgenic mice and patients et al Mattiazzi et al Menzies et al Damiano et al Concerning energy homeostasis and ATP deficits mutant causes a decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes I and IV which are associated with defective energy metabolism et al Another key function of mitochondria concerns the regulation of cytosolic calcium levels several studies reported a loss of Ca binding proteins in motoneurons of ALS patients related to the presence of mutant et al Mattson which leads to reduced calcium uptake from the cytoplasm increasing the sensitivity to excitotoxicity Moreover mitochondria are required in areas with high demand of ATP and calcium homeostasis such as synaptic terminals Therefore transport of mitochondria to these areas is of primary importance and defects in mitochondrial axonal transport lead to metabolic alterations in neurons and Manfredi et al Altered protein expression in mutant mitochondria has also been reported et al Kirby et al Lukas et al Since the majority of proteins required for the function of this organelle are synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported in the mitochondria mutant associated to the mitochondrial surface could prevent protein import et al Glutamate Excitotoxicity Glutamate the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal and diffuses across the synaptic cleft activating specific postsynaptic receptors and triggering action potentials This neurotransmitter acts on different receptors on the dendrites of the postsynaptic motoneuron such as and receptors The depolarization of neuronal membranes after activation of neuronal glutamate receptors activates calcium channels allowing calcium to enter the cell After release from the presynaptic neuron glutamate is removed from the synaptic cleft by several glial and neuronal cell transporter proteins excitatory amino acid transporters Sundaram et al The concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is thus finely regulated avoiding excitotoxicity an excessive or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors results in degeneration and eventually death of the involved neurons and Eggett A sustained elevation of intracellular calcium levels triggers enzymatic and mitochondrial damages that lead to the formation of ROS and activates several destructive biochemical processes determining excitatory damage and neuronal degeneration et al Vucic et al Therefore the rapid removal of glutamate is required to prevent neuronal toxicity In particular the isoform of the astroglial glutamate transporter is involved in keeping the amount of glutamate below excitotoxic level in the nervous system Before the identification of the genetic links of fALS glutamate excitotoxicity was one of the first hypotheses proposed as pathogenetic mechanism of ALS and The motor cortex and spinal cord of ALS patients and transgenic mutant mouse models were found to have reduced level probably due to the presence of aberrant mRNA or to cleavage of the transporter This leads to an increase of synaptic glutamate concentration and an of glutamate postsynaptic receptors determining excitotoxic neuronal degeneration et al Zarei et al The loss of functional was also observed in affected brain regions of other neurodegenerative diseases such as and diseases et al To establish whether loss of functional in ALS was a primary cause of neuron degeneration or a consequence of cell damage transgenic mutant mice overexpressing double transgenic were generated to investigate whether supplementation of loss would delay or rescue the disease Mice with an increased expression showed a delay in motoneuron degeneration and disease progression Since no change in lifespan was found comparing mice with mice it was concluded that loss of may contribute to motoneuron degeneration in ALS but is not the principal cause et al Moreover the selective vulnerability of motoneurons in ALS may be due to a higher permeability to calcium of these cells compared with other neurons probably caused by a defect in RNA editing of the subunit of AMPA which renders this receptor more permeable to calcium et al Oxidative Stress Free radicals or ROS are natural products of oxygen metabolism The term oxidative stress is used when the production of ROS is higher than the capacity of cells to remove them This leads to the accumulation of ROS which causes irreversible damage to cell structures and macromolecules such as proteins DNA and RNA is the major enzyme to prevent oxidative damage and to reduce superoxide leakage from mitochondria Mutations in this gene can cause alterations in the activity of the protein leading to cytotoxicity Early studies suggested that mutations in the gene cause a complete loss of protein function et al Subsequently in vitro experiments demonstrated that mutant human proteins as the are active and stable promoting neural apoptosis in a dominant manner et al Rabizadeh et al These studies suggest ALS pathogenesis may involve not only a decrease loss in the enzymatic function of but is also probably due to a dominant toxic gain of function of the enzyme It has been proposed that mutant could revert its normal antioxidant activity producing toxic superoxide the mutated protein could take electrons from other cellular antioxidants and donate them to molecular oxygen producing superoxide and making the source of oxidative stress et al Liochev and Fridovich Increased levels of free radicals and of oxidative damage were found in cerebrospinal fluid serum and urine samples of ALS patients et al and could be due to an altered geometry in the active site of the mutated which allows entry of reducing substrates Oxidative stress in ALS may also derive from a defective oxidative phosphorylation et al as reported from studies of CSF in transgenic mice and in patients in which ROS produced from defective oxidative phosphorylation such as were found in high concentration et al Moreover this study combined the increase of ROS with mitochondrial dysfunction and provided an example of how different pathogenetic mechanisms of ALS may be Protein Aggregates Protein aggregates are a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases such as diseases and ALS These aggregates derive from the accumulation of misfolded proteins which oligomerize and aggregate gaining toxic properties Inclusions rich in mutated proteins have been found in tissues from both sALS and fALS cases as well in mutant transgenic mice et al The structure of in the aggregates is not clear but it seems that the protein is and lacks both copper and zinc atoms The aberrant accumulation of mutated proteins is also related to a lack of their degradation resulting in aggregates consisting of mutated and other mutated proteins related to ALS such as or FUS an protein is normally located in the nucleus where it regulates transcription splicing and mRNA transport This protein is necessary for the prevention of DNA damage et al aberrant protein inclusions have been reported in of ALS cases and it seems that the cytoplasmic accumulation is due to mutations in the UTR region of the genes which lead to overexpression and altered location of the protein et al Coan and Mitchell As FUS is a nuclear protein The accumulation of and FUS in the cytoplasm is probably due to mutations which prevent their shuttles to the nucleus and Haass Protein inclusions in ALS contain also other components such as chaperones mitochondrial proteins ubiquitin and neurofilaments Moreover the aberrant accumulation of ubiquitin and of ubiquinated and misfolded proteins could affect the normal function of the proteasome machinery impairing normal protein degradation and leading to further protein accumulation degeneration and death of motoneurons Accumulation of Neurofilaments Accumulation and or aggregation of NFs in the cell bodies and axons and abnormal location of phosphorylated NFs in the cell body are typical pathological hallmarks of ALS NFs are the major intermediate filaments in they are the most abundant cytoskeletal components of large myelinated axons and control the axonal caliber NFs are formed by the of light medium and heavy subunits is necessary for filament assembly whereas and form links with other NFs in the axon Also is an integral component of NFs in the CNS in particular during axon elongation et al The mechanisms leading to the formation of NF aggregates in ALS are still unclear Mutations in NF genes occur in fALS and sALS and seem to be correlated with abnormal phosphorylation of NFs Phosphorylation of and usually occurs only in the axon and the rate of NF transport is inversely correlated to their phosphorylation state The abnormal phosphorylation could alter the axonal transport of NFs determining their accumulation in the cell bodies and proximal axon This accumulation could be at the basis of defects in axonal transport of other cellular components important for cell survival such as mitochondria et al The aggregation of NFs could also be due to their altered stoichiometry overexpression or downregulation of NF subunits in murine models of ALS provoke NF accumulation and Eyer Transgenic mice which overexpress the subunit exhibit excessive accumulation of NFs in the perikarya and proximal axon of motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord accompanied by proximal axonal swelling and subsequent degeneration et al In situ hybridization revealed a consistent reduction in mRNA levels in degenerating spinal motoneurons of ALS patients et al et al Wong et al while deficiency accelerates motoneuron degeneration in transgenic mice et al indicating the importance of NF protein stoichiometry in the distribution and aggregation of NFs Surprisingly overexpression of both and subunits significantly slowed down disease progression in mouse models of ALS Double transgenic mice gene and or showed a significant delay in disease progression and an extension of survival compared with mice and Xu suggesting a protective effect of NF accumulation The mechanism of this protection is unclear but perikaryal accumulation of NFs rather than their axonal deficiency could be responsible in slowing down the disease The abnormal organization of NF seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALS although the relationship between their accumulation and motoneuron neurodegeneration remains unclear Despite the correlation of some mutations of NF genes with ALS disease specific mutations in NF genes have not been identified indicating that probably NF gene mutations are not a common cause of ALS but could represent a risk factor for selective motoneuron vulnerability Neuroinflammation A common characteristic of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases is the neuroinflammatory response characterized by activated microglia astrogliosis and infiltrating immune cells in the sites of neuronal injury Although ALS involves the selective death of motoneurons different lines of evidence have shown that neuronal injury is but depends on a finely regulated dialog between motoneurons and glial cells Deregulated communication between neurons and glial cells compromises neuronal homeostasis and survival and the involvement of mutant glia in motoneuron degeneration is well documented The expression of mutant gene limited to motoneurons is not sufficient to cause disease in transgenic mouse model of ALS leading to suppose that their degeneration requires the participation of cells et al motoneurons surrounded by glial cells carrying a mutated gene develop the pathological phenotype while mutated motoneurons surrounded by glia show a healthy phenotype et al Moreover the replacement of mutant in glial cells with glia delays the disease and prolongs the survival of ALS mice et al Thus damaged glia and neurons act together contributing to the process of neurodegeneration and to disease progression In the CNS microglial cells are the resident macrophages and represent the first line of defense against infection or injury monitoring the extracellular environment and interacting with neurons and astrocytes These cells have immunological properties with both neuroprotective and neurotoxic potential After CNS injury microglial activation is a major component of neuroinflammation In particular in ALS the interaction between motoneurons and microglia initially protects neurons When motoneuron damage worsens motoneurons and astrocytes release misfolded proteins as mutated and other toxic molecules that stimulate the activation of microglial cells which switch from an and neuroprotective to a and neurotoxic phenotype et al Zhao et al Microglial activation includes activated microglia and alternatively activated microglia microglia are cytotoxic and secrete ROS proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic molecules mediating motoneuron death et al Elliott Studies in transgenic mice have shown that the replacement of mutant microglia with microglia as well as the specific reduction of the expression of mutant gene in these cells significantly reduce motoneuron degeneration and extend the lifespan of the animals et al et al This points to an involvement of microglial cells in neurodegeneration underlining that mutant microglia acquire a toxic phenotype promoting disease progression Unlike the phenotype microglia produce high levels of cytokines and neurotrophic factors that enhance the protection and survival of motoneurons The upregulation of markers in the spinal cord of mice demonstrated that in the early stage of the disease microglia display an phenotype which promotes repair and regeneration During disease progression damaged motoneurons induce microglial cells to release ROS and proinflammatory cytokines and to acquire an phenotype leading to further neurotoxicity et al Activated microglia increase during disease progression due to their interaction with the cell microenvironment at different stages of the disease which plays a key role in determining a neuroprotective or neurotoxic function of microglia Astrocytes are the largest glial cell components of the CNS and play many important functions in maintaining and supporting neurons Reactive astrogliosis has been implicated in neurodegeneration and in the progression of ALS One of the most important functions of astrocytes in supporting neurons is to maintain low concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft through glutamate receptors In patients with sALS and fALS as well as in mice astrocytes downregulate the transporter determining a less efficient uptake of glutamate and contributing to excitotoxicity et al Other studies have shown that upon activation an insufficient release of neurotrophic factors and the release of neurotoxic factors from astrocytes are involved in neurodegeneration and Yamanaka This was also indicated by analyses of astrocytes in tissue of ALS patients which revealed an upregulation of genes encoding chemokines proinflammatory cytokines and components of the complement cascade which could exacerbate neural damage and loss of already compromised neurons et al Moreover the selective removal of the mutant gene from astrocytes or the transplantation of healthy astroglial cells slowed down the disease progression attenuated motoneuron loss and increased the lifespan in transgenic mice et al Yamanaka et al indicating the involvement of astroglial cells in the neurodegeneration process Therapeutic Approaches in ALS Given the complexity of ALS pathogenesis to date there is no effective treatment to cure or significantly ameliorate the quality of life of patients Nevertheless several therapeutic strategies have been proposed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life of ALS patients Pharmacological Therapy The only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is riluzole benzothiazole also known as that acts as an inhibitor of glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals by blocking sodium channels thus limiting glutamate excitotoxicity Moreover riluzole has other neuroprotective pharmacological actions including the modulation of the NMDA ionotropic receptors inactivation of sodium channels and inhibition of the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter acid et al In vitro studies have demonstrated that riluzole protects motoneuron cell lines from glutamate stress blocking excitotoxic damage Neuroprotection has also been observed in vivo in models of ALS in which treatment with the drug before the onset prolongs survival and slows neurodegeneration improving motor performance of the treated animals et al However the clinical use of riluzole mg prolongs the life of patients by months although the results obtained in clinical trials are often controversial et al The beneficial effect is very modest only a small beneficial effect in both bulbar and limb functions but no effect on muscle strength were found In some studies the neuroprotective effect of riluzole was examined in combination with other drugs Rasagiline is an antiapoptotic drug which reduces oxidative stress inhibition of monoamine oxidase and preserves mitochondrial membrane potential The combined treatment of rasagiline with riluzole determined a improvement in motor performance and extended survival in mice more than treatments in which rasaligine was administered alone et al Given the modest efficacy and the high cost doubts persist about the clinical administration of these drugs and additional studies are needed to improve their clinical effect Since loss of neurotrophic support to motoneurons has been proposed as mechanism contributing to ALS several studies have reported that increased levels of growth factors as growth factor glial cell line derived growth factor and ciliary neurotrophic have a positive effect in experimental models of the disease and Oppenheim promoting neuron hypertrophy and survival In particular in animal models the efficacy of growth factors delivered by gene stimulate the secretion of specific trophic factors to target or by directed infusion of the trophic factors in the spinal cord or in the brain provided a modest benefit slowing down disease progression and increasing survival of the animals et al However human trials based on the use of neurotrophic factors showed modest or no effects et al These pharmacological strategies are directed against one or a few altered mechanisms involved in ALS and their use has only a minimal impact on the disease course Probably for an efficient therapeutic approach it could be helpful to counteract different pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the disease For this reason since the transplantation of stem cells and gene therapy can act via multiple mechanisms in the last years an increasing interest has been addressed to these therapeutic approaches Gene Therapy ALS can be caused by dominant mutations in that give toxic property to the mutant protein Since the complete absence of the gene does not cause the disease in mice et al the gene silencing has been regarded as an interesting possibility to limit the course of the pathology In particular a lentivirus encoding for a RNA silencing that catalyzes the selective degradation of was used in this approach The injection of this virus in the muscle or directly in the spinal cord of transgenic mouse models of ALS reduced expression delaying the neurodegeneration but data about the slowing down of the disease progression and survival are controversial et al Raoul et al Moreover this approach could be used only for a familial form of ALS and not for sALS which represents the majority of cases An antisense oligonucleotide directed to was found to decrease the concentration of mRNA and related protein in the spinal cord prolonging survival in the rat model of the disease et al After this encouraging result to date the only clinical trial performed in phase I has shown the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of this antisense oligonucleotide et al Despite the small number of patients the study showed that the intrathecal administration of antisense oligonucleotide is safe and However antisense oligonucleotides do not cross the barrier and to cure ALS patients they should be delivered directly to the CNS and Boulis which is difficult to achieve Moreover this type of treatment requires a constant infusion of repeated doses of the antisense nucleotide Gene therapy requires to be optimized for a successful approach to neurodegenerative diseases Stem Cell Therapy Stem cells are becoming a promising therapeutic approach to neuronal replacement and regeneration becoming a source of great hope and expectation for patients affected by different neurodegenerative diseases including ALS The use of stem cells as therapeutic approach is of great interest given their ability to home to damaged sites stimulate tissue repair and regeneration and direct their differentiation in response to extracellular signals et al Stem cells are a group of cells with the ability of and to differentiate in many cell types They are usually divided in two major subtypes embryonic stem cells originated from the inner cell mass of blastocyst and that possess the ability to produce all the three germ adult stem cells specialized cells that can differentiate into many cell types of different organs usually determined by the germ layer of origin et al Among the different stem cell types the most common used for neurological diseases are ESC neural stem cells MSC and induced pluripotent stem cells The best source of stem cells should be chosen on the basis of their biological features to survive migrate to the damaged tissues engraft and differentiate et al The main objectives of the treatment with stem cells are cellular replacement and neural protection The first objective would be achieved by the stem cell differentiation into specific cell subtypes involved in the disease with the purpose to replace dead cells The second objective involves the use of stem cells based on their ability to release trophic factors and to remove neurotoxic molecules providing a local support in the microenvironment of the damaged area acting as neural protectors Among the different types of stem cells used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases MSC seem to have aroused the highest interest as promising candidates et al MSC can be isolated from a variety of fetal and adult tissues such as skeletal muscle placenta umbilical cord blood and adipose tissue Adipose tissue is gaining increasing interest because it is available in large amount from liposuction allowing autologous transplantation of MSC There are several technical advantages in the application of MSC First of all their isolation is safe and easy their expansion in vitro is simple and it was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that they can differentiate in and cells et al and Maragakis MSC are less susceptible to tumoral changes and do not require immunosuppressive treatment to prevent rejection given the possibility of autologous transplantation Moreover as the other stem cells after transplantation and migration MSC are attracted to the damaged area where they increase the release of neurotrophic factors et al Several studies have provided evidence for the efficacy of MSC in in vivo models of ALS demonstrating that their injections can delay the death of motoneurons decrease the inflammatory response and may prolong survival of the animals Results of some preclinical studies in in vivo models of ALS with MSC are reported in Table Table Applications of mesenchymal stem cells in amyotrophic

promising approach to cure ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders to date no significant effects on the disease progression have been obtained compared to controls and key issues need to be solved before extensive clinical translation First it is necessary to identify the delivery of the cells to the CNS using standardized protocols and considering the route of administration the dose of cells the timing and the number of Moreover given the high proliferative capacity of stem cells the oncogenic transformation of transplanted cells should be prevented and their immunorejection avoided After the demonstration that only a small proportion of injected stem cells can reach engraft and differentiate in the site of injury the idea that the beneficial effect of stem cells is indirect and most probably depends on their paracrine activity is becoming more pervasive et al Maumus et al Lai et al Stem cells produce a large spectrum of EVs which contain cytokines chemokines growth factors proteins and nucleic acids and can exert significant effects on cells mediating communication These observations led to the hypothesis that stem cells exert their beneficial effect through the secretion of EVs which enhance the repair of the damaged area releasing their content Thus EVs could be used as a novel therapeutic approach avoiding all the risks associated with the use of cells Extracellular Vesicles Intercellular communication plays a fundamental role in multicellular organisms It can be mediated through a direct contact between cells or by the secretion of molecules such as growth factors chemokines and cytokines exerting their effect on cells in their proximity In the last decades a novel mechanism of cell communication has been proposed and involves intercellular transfer of EVs These vesicles represent a vehicle to transfer membrane and cytoplasmic proteins lipids and nucleic acids between cells becoming an integral part of the intercellular microenvironment and playing a role in many physiological and pathological processes EVs are spherical particles enclosed by a phospholipid bilayer They can be distinguished on the basis of their size from nm to nm in lipid and protein composition sedimentation rate flotation density on a sucrose cargo and biogenesis pathway et al Lai et al According to the biogenesis morphology protein compositions and size EVs are classified as microvesicles and exosomes Microvesicles Microvesicles known as shedding range from nm to nm in diameter although the size ranges of microvesicles and exosomes may overlap especially when vesicles are isolated from biological fluids et al Microvesicles are released by budding from the plasma membrane through a process dependent on intracellular calcium concentration calpain and cytoskeleton reorganization unlike exosomes whose release is independent of cell calcium influx et al Calcium ions are responsible for the changes in phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane which is of primary importance for the formation of cytoplasmic protrusions et al Microvesicles are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer and contain proteins lipids and nucleic acids depending on the cell of origin A typical characteristic of these vesicles is that they usually contain proteins associated with lipid rafts and cholesterol sphingomyelin ceramide and phosphatidylserine et al Exosomes Exosomes are EVs produced by almost all cell types with a diameter ranging from nm to nm and a flotation density of g ml et al They are present in many biological fluids including urine saliva blood amniotic fluid and CSF as well as in a conditioned medium of cell culture The most commonly used techniques for their isolation are represented by ultracentrifugation ultrafiltration and immunoprecipitation although many isolation kits are currently available et al Raposo and Stoorvogel The morphology of exosomes is described as after visualization by transmission electron microscopy They are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer and contain many characteristic proteins lipids and functional RNAs in particular mRNAs and microRNA that can be transferred between cells Concerning protein composition exosomes from different cell types present typical proteins GTPase and or membrane proteins tetraspanin and proteins and involved in their biogenesis transport and fusion and Stoorvogel The cargo and composition of exosomes are unique and depend in part from the cell of origin and its physiological state and Exosomes derived from diseased cells are usually implicated in the spread of pathological processes or in the propagation of diseases while exosomes derived from stem cells can be used as therapeutic tools and Many studies on the biochemical composition of exosomes have been performed The results on the composition of exosomes in terms of proteins nucleic acids and lipids are reported in the database ExoCarta recently incorporated in another database Vesiclepedia which includes data from all types of EVs et al Raposo and Stoorvogel Some of the properties as size and of exosomes overlap with those of microvesicles but exosomes are the only class known to have an endosomal origin distinguishing them from other vesicles Exosomes originate from invagination and endocytosis of the plasma membrane These early endosomes mature through a series of transformation and changes in protein content to become late endosomes The membranes of late endosomes give rise to vesicles ranging from nm in size contained in multivesicular bodies which during this phase have incorporated proteins plasma membrane and Golgi lipids and nucleic acids et al The multivesicular bodies can be degraded in lysosomes or can be fused with the plasma membrane releasing exosomes in the extracellular environment Released exosomes can act in a paracrine or endocrine manner modifying the behavior of adjacent or distant cells The role of exosomes in physiological and pathological processes depends on their ability to interact with recipient cells to deliver their content In particular the vesicles can be internalized by recipient cells by endocytosis by fusion or after contact with surface receptors and Stoorvogel Kourembanas Functions of Extracellular Vesicles in Intercellular Communication Once secreted from the cells exosomes and microvesicles can interact with adjacent or distant recipient cells and deliver their cargo modulating their activities In addition to providing biologically active molecules EVs protect these molecules against degradation until they reach the target site and facilitate their uptake from the recipient cells The uptake can be direct by fusion with the target cell or by endocytosis or indirect mediated by receptor binding The fusion of EVs with the plasma membrane determines the direct release of the content of EVs inside the cells while with the other mechanisms EVs remain within the endosome until they fuse with the endosome membrane releasing their content into the cytoplasm Alternatively endosomes can fuse with lysosomes leading to the degradation of the vesicles and their content et al The proteins and functional RNAs contained in the EVs are implicated in many biochemical and cellular processes such as communication inflammation tissue repair and regeneration cell differentiation as well as metabolism et al The cargo and therefore the functions of EVs depend on the phenotype of the cell of origin Nevertheless it has been shown that a selective enrichment of specific molecules occurs some proteins and above all functional RNAs are preferentially sorted to EVs and released through them et al and the selective fate of molecules into the EVs is finely regulated in both physiological and pathological conditions During development secreted EVs contain morphogens as sonic hedgehog and retinoic playing an important role in developmental signaling and morphogenesis et al EVs also contain bioactive lipids that can stimulate cytokine secretion induce chemotaxis or inhibit apoptosis et al EVs released from tumor cells contain molecules which stimulate proliferation angiogenesis and metastasis et al Moreover in this case cells release EVs containing and Fas ligand allowing tumor cells to escape from apoptosis and immunosurveillance Concerning EVs secreted from stem cells it was hypothesized that they can be involved in and the pluripotency typical of these cells and that they can play key roles in signaling within the stem cell niche Recently more attention has been given to the ability of EVs to transfer genetic information between cells in particular mRNAs and miRNAs Intercellular communication based on these functional RNAs require the selectively compartmentation of RNAs in an appropriate vehicle the protection from circulating RNAses and the ability of RNA to retain the capability to control gene expression For these reasons EVs represent an optimal candidate for genetic exchange between cells modulating the behavior of recipient cells Exosomes released from MSC may regulate neurite outgrowth and neural plasticity by the transfer of et al Exosomes obtained from bone contain and which are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation et al This indicates that the biological effects on the neighboring cells can be in part regulated by of EVs Therapeutic Applications of Exosomes Since exosomes and microvesicles can transfer biological information over long distance increasing attention has been paid to these vesicles as promoters of suppressors of pathological processes As exosomes are smaller than microvesicles and capable to cross the BBB here we will focus on the use of exosomes as a potential therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and diseases There is evidence that infusion of exosomes isolated from neuroblastoma or primary neurons into the brain ameliorates disease course in a mouse model sequestering intracerebral peptide et al Another cellular source to obtain exosomes is represented by MSC and several studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of these exosomes In particular exosomes derived from MSC isolated from dental pulp protected dopaminergic neurons against neurodegeneration induced by oxidative stress reducing the production of ROS and consequently apoptosis indicating a potential therapeutic use of exosomes in the treatment of disease et al Another study reported that exosomes isolated from adipose decrease the levels of in an in vitro model of disease thanks to the high level of neprilysin important protein for the proteolysis of whose activity and expression decrease during the contained in the exosomes et al The neuroprotective effect of exosomes obtained from ASC was also demonstrated in human neuroblastoma cell line and primary murine hippocampal neurons after an oxidative insult et al Moreover exosomes derived from have been used to improve recovery and neuroregeneration after stroke and traumatic brain injury et al Zhang et al We recently demonstrated that exosomes isolated from ASC exert a neuroprotective effect in an in vitro model of ALS et al In this study we used the cell line transiently and stable transfected with different point mutations to mimic the behavior of ALS motoneurons and H O as pathological insult The presence of exosomes increased ALS motoneuron survival probably counteracting the apoptosis pathway underlining their possible therapeutic application to ALS Another study demonstrated the possible application of ASC derived exosomes in ALS reducing mutant aggregation and restoring mitochondrial protein function et al Moreover exosomes derived from ASC ameliorated the disease progression in an in vitro model of disease reducing huntingtin protein aggregates and the level of apoptotic proteins et al Altogether these studies indicate a protective beneficial role of exosomes in different neurodegenerative diseases Increasing evidence suggests that exosomes display properties reducing the number of activated inflammatory microglial cells supporting oligodendrocytes and protecting neurons et al Pusic et al Moreover exosomes injected intranasally are transported rapidly to the brain where they can be taken up by microglial cells et al Since as stated above neuroinflammation is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases the suppression of the neuroinflammatory response and the possibility to reach easily the CNS are of great importance for the treatment of these pathologies The increasing attention to the use of exosomes for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases derives from the capability of exosomes to cross the BBB the physiological barrier that separates the brain parenchyma from circulating blood in the CNS As mentioned before current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are often symptomatic and do not halt the degenerative the main problem for the cure of these pathologies is the inability of cells and drugs to cross the BBB Recent studies have reported that exosomes unlike microvesicles can cross the BBB the hypothesis is that exosomes are internalized by endothelial cells and through the release of specific cargo they affect the integrity of cell junctions increasing permeability between cells and allowing a massive entry of vesicles in the CNS et al Tominaga et al and where they could exert neuroprotective actions Figure Hypothetical mechanisms of action of exosomes Exosomes interact with the endothelial cells of the barrier modifying the integrity of cell junctions and increasing the permeability between cells This mechanism allows a massive entry of vesicles in the central nervous system Once in the CNS exosomes could interact directly on motoneurons modulating different biological processes as apoptosis cell proliferation gene expression and oxidative or indirectly modifying the local motoneuron environment acting on glial cells that decrease the release of toxic factor and inflammatory mediators These direct and indirect mechanisms of action of exosomes could counteract the pathological mechanisms involved in the disease In this regards we recently set up a protocol to label exosomes with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and the use of labeled exosomes which allows their detection by magnetic resonance imaging could be useful to verify this hypothesis et al Conclusions and Future Perspectives The scientific interest on MSC as potential therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases is due to their ability to migrate to damaged tissues differentiate and contribute to reparative processes et al Besides these characteristics ASC are also easily available and can be used for autologous transplantation avoiding possible cell rejection et al These properties make ASC a candidate for cell therapy based on cell replacement and cell differentiation These features have led different research groups to use ASC as possible therapy for ALS In a study on the effects of ASC systemic administration in a murine model of ALS we have demonstrated that the treatment delayed signs of motor deterioration although a limited amount of ASC in the site of injury was detected et al Since the beneficial effects of ASC could be due to paracrine activity rather than to their engraftment the scientific community has shifted the focus from cells to EVs which thanks to their content can recapitulate the ASC effects and could potentially provide the basis for a therapy for the treatment of ALS This innovative therapy would be easy to transfer to ALS patients since the EVs would be obtained from autologous ASC and would preserve the immune properties of their origins avoiding immunogenic reaction In view of a possible application of EVs to ALS a disease in which the BBB is not disrupted the vesicles need to cross the BBB to reach the site of injury and among EVs exosomes have the required characteristics To test the effects of exosomes in ALS we have recently demonstrated that the administration of exosomes in an in vitro model of ALS exerts a neuroprotective effect following an oxidative insult supporting the idea that exosomes can recapitulate and ameliorate the neuroprotective effect of stem cell therapy et al The evaluation of the exosomes content in terms of proteins mRNAs and miRNAs and their correlation with a specific cellular pathway involved in ALS could pave the way to explain their mechanism of action Moreover the understanding of the involved pathways could lead to the generation of engineered cells which release exosomes enriched with specific molecules This could lead to a targeted

and reduced iron as an electron donor has been proposed as one of the oldest photoautotrophic metabolisms on Earth Under the but sulfide poor conditions dominating the Archean ocean this type of metabolism could have accounted for most of the primary production in the photic zone Here we review the current knowledge of biogeochemical microbial and phylogenetic aspects of photoferrotrophy and evaluate the ecological significance of this process in ancient and modern environments From the ferruginous conditions that prevailed during most of the Archean the ancient ocean evolved toward euxinic and sulfide conditions and finally much after the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis to a predominantly oxic environment Under these new conditions photoferrotrophs lost importance as primary producers and now photoferrotrophy remains as a vestige of a formerly relevant photosynthetic process Apart from the geological record and other biogeochemical markers modern environments resembling the redox conditions of these ancient oceans can offer insights into the past significance of photoferrotrophy and help to explain how this metabolism operated as an important source of organic carbon for the early biosphere meromictic lakes can be considered as modern analogs of the ancient Archean ocean as they present anoxic ferruginous water columns where light can still be available at the chemocline thus offering suitable niches for photoferrotrophs A few bacterial strains of purple bacteria as well as of green sulfur bacteria have been shown to possess photoferrotrophic capacities and hence could thrive in these modern Archean ocean analogs Studies addressing the occurrence and the biogeochemical significance of photoferrotrophy in ferruginous environments have been conducted so far in lakes Matano Pavin La Cruz and the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu To date only in the latter two lakes a biogeochemical role of photoferrotrophs has been confirmed In this review we critically summarize the current knowledge on photosynthesis as a remains of ancient Earth biogeochemistry photoferrotrophy anoxygenic phototrophs Archean ocean ferruginous conditions meromictic lakes evolution Ministerio de y Competitividad Introduction Photosynthesis is the main primary production process fueling life on Earth It requires light as energy source inorganic carbon to be fixed and a source of electrons Hamilton et al While oxygenic photosynthesis is currently the dominant process for fixing inorganic carbon into organic matter this has changed during the history of life Olson and Blankenship Very different conditions existed on early Earth Canfield et al as the chemical environment g the availability of electron acceptors and donors for biogeochemical and consequently the favored biogeochemical processes differed in the ancient biosphere from those currently prevailing Even though rates of marine primary production were much lower in these primitive seas than in modern oceans the most active ecosystems were probably driven by cycling of H and Canfield et al though other and chemolithoautotrophic processes could also have contributed g and sulfide Still the early appearance of photosynthesis enhanced biological productivity by orders of magnitude compared to metabolisms based on acetogenesis and methanogenesis as the ancestral forms of carbon and energy metabolisms Sleep and Bird Sousa et al Some modern ecosystems Burns et al still show determinant similar features e redox conditions iron and sulfur to those predominating on ancient Earth and offer opportunities to study the processes that sustained microbial life in the primitive biosphere Photoferrotrophs which use as an electron donor and light as an energy source for inorganic carbon fixation Widdel et al as well as their biogeochemical role in modern and ancient ferruginous systems are particularly addressed in this review Evolution of the Biogeochemical Conditions in Ancient Oceans Once liquid water appeared on Earth around Ga ago Mojzsis et al life could emerge and develop in the oceans of the Archean to Ga not later than around Ga ago Mojzsis et al as evidenced from biologically fractionated organic carbon Nutman et al or even earlier Abramov and Mojzsis The energy required for inorganic carbon fixation was available from sunlight and from the oxidation of inorganic chemical substrates by chemolithoautotrophs using inorganic electron acceptors Both and chemolithoautotrophy were consequently an option for primary production on the primitive Earth Canfield et al The advent of photosynthesis however relieved life from its dependence on the of reduced and oxidized inorganic compounds as required for chemolithoautotrophy Indeed their is often limited by a high chemical i e if oxidized and reduced substances readily react chemically their availability for microbially mediated redox processes diminishes In this context light offers the advantage of being an energy source that is not dependent on such therefore extending the potential niches for life colonization although in water columns its availability is also limited to the surface photic layers Photosynthesis appeared in the early Archean Olson Fischer et al and photosynthetic microbial mats populated benthic environments of oceans shores by around Ga ago Tice and Lowe though stromatolites formed around Ga ago have also been recently reported Nutman et al It is generally recognized that anoxygenic photosynthesis evolved before the more complex oxygenic photosynthesis Xiong et al Xiong Schopf Gupta The latter is thought to have appeared around Ga ago Buick but and other data suggest that it may have been present even much earlier Rosing and Frei Planavsky et al Some studies for instance provide evidence that oxygen was already present in the late Archean surface environment supporting oxidative elemental cycling Anbar et al Kendall et al Stolper et al Crowe et al Lalonde and Konhauser Frei et al These oxygen traces or the consequences of these oxidative processes could have resulted from abiotic reactions such as CO photodissociation Lu et al and H O disproportionation et al but also from biological processes like benthic oxygenic photosynthesis Lalonde and Konhauser Atmospheric oxygen accumulation however did not occur at a global scale before the Great Oxidation Event around Ga ago Bekker et al Kaufman et al Konhauser et al Lyons et al Luo et al Instead multiple evidences suggest that photoferrotrophy could have been a relevant photoautotrophic process in the ancient biosphere During most of Earth history the ocean was anoxic and its chemistry was influenced Figure by the activity of microbial life Blake et al Reduced iron of hydrothermal origin Klein from biologically processed continental sources Li et al and or released by events Konhauser et al dominated the mesophilic Hren et al Blake et al Poulton and Canfield Shen et al Crowe et al Archean ocean chemistry Figures From these ferruginous conditions a transition toward a more sulfidic ocean occurred from the late Archean to the Mesoproterozoic Poulton et al Canfield et al Reinhard et al though sulfide was likely spatially confined to parts of the ocean Reinhard et al Modern analogs of these ancient euxinic environments still exist such as the Black Sea g Overmann et al Meyer and Kump or meromictic Noguerola et al and holomictic g Camacho and Vicente Camacho et al Camacho lacustrine basins In this environment of the Proterozoic anoxygenic photosynthesis acquired a more relevant role as a primary production process Kharecha et al Johnston et al However ferruginous conditions probably persisted in some zones of the oceans throughout the Proterozoic Poulton and Canfield and even transiently dominated again chemistry in the Neoproterozoic Canfield et al Planavsky et al though these deep layers were probably aphotic Later on during the Phanerozoic Ga the ocean became fully oxygenated Holland Hamilton et al Figure In any case during the first stages of life reduced iron dominated ocean chemistry and microorganisms with metabolisms were likely important biogeochemical actors on the primitive Earth Poulton and Canfield Kendall et al et al FIGURE Geochemical changes from the Archean to the Proterozoic ocean Time before

especially between the Neoarchean and Early Paleoproterozoic the Siderian Ga Pecoits et al Both chemical and biological processes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for BIF genesis in the different time periods Figure These include Johnson et al Posth et al by UV light Klein or by photochemically produced H O although the significance of these processes seems rather low Konhauser et al

nitrogen oxides g Klueglein and Kappler though the sufficient availability of these oxides to support a visible contribution of this mechanism is yet to be shown However direct oxidation by microbial processes Garrels et al Hartman Li et al Posth et al Czaja et al Chan et al mainly by anoxygenic phototrophs using as electron donor seems an attractive mechanism for early BIF formation particularly

Photoferrotrophy and Photoferrotrophs Iron is the most abundant metal on Earth and among the most abundant elements in the crust Kendall et al Under circumneutral pH conditions particularly in its ionic form it is rapidly oxidized by oxygen to highly insoluble oxides As a consequence iron can become a limiting nutrient for primary producers in vast areas of the modern ocean where iron

microorganisms use light energy and the reducing power of to fix inorganic carbon according to Widdel et al HCO H O light h OH CH O H Anoxygenic photosynthesis with as electron donor using exclusively photosystem I has been proposed as being the earliest type of photosynthetic process Des Marais Xiong et al Raymond et al While there is currently no supporting evidence from genomic studies Frigaard and Bryant Gupta that photoferrotrophy evolved prior to anoxygenic photosynthesis with other electron donors such as sulfide or hydrogen the ancient environmental conditions suggest that was an important metabolic process in the Archean oceans prior to the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis Molecular phylogenetic analyses of enzymes involved in bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis support the existence of anoxygenic phototrophs prior to oxygenic phototrophs Xiong et al Xiong Gupta although horizontal gene transfer between photosynthetic organisms complicates the phylogeny Raymond et al Before demonstrating its occurrence photoferrotrophy was hypothesized as a possible autotrophic metabolism for different types of phototrophic prokaryotes Olson and Blankenship Olson Some authors suggested the possibility that both cyanobacteria g Cohen Cohen et al Pierson and Olson Pierson et al and green sulfur bacteria et al could perform anoxygenic photosynthesis with as electron donor In spite of their capacity for anoxygenic photosynthesis Cohen et al and its crucial role on Earth biogeochemistry no evidence for the occurrence of photoferrotrophy has been provided so far for modern cyanobacteria Trouwborst et al Swanner et al Hamilton et al Anoxygenic photosynthesis using as electron donor was unequivocally demonstrated for the first time in purple bacteria some of which were able to grow either photoautotrophically and or photoheterotrophically Widdel et al Ehrenreich and Widdel In the meantime photoferrotrophy has been detected in bacteria of different phylogenetic groups and either from freshwater or marine origin including representatives of purple sulfur bacteria purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria Even though most of these anoxygenic phototrophs are able to use several types of electron donors commonly found in anaerobic environments g H S and H Bryant and Frigaard Camacho there are some specific strains that have been demonstrated to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis Croal et al These include strains phylogenetically related to PSB such as the freshwater Thiodictyon sp Croal et al Hegler et al and the marine species Rhodovulum iodosum and Rhodovulum robiginosum Straub et al Wu et al freshwater PNSB such as Rhodobacter ferrooxidans sp strain Ehrenreich and Widdel Hegler et al Rhodomicrobium vannielii Heising and Schink and Rhodopseudomonas palustris Jiao et al Jiao and Newman as well as a freshwater species of GSB Chlorobium ferrooxidans Heising et al Although the PNSB Rhodobacter capsulatus is also capable of oxidizing in presence of light this is not a real photoautotrophic process Caiazza et al Kopf and Newman and can be considered as a detoxification mechanism Poulain and Newman The best studied photoferrotrophs are purple bacteria g Widdel et al Eickhoff et al Wu et al When comparing PSB with PNSB rates of photooxidation are influenced by the response to light g light of each photoferrotrophic species This was shown by Kappler et al comparing the iron photoxidation of the purple sulfur bacteria Thiodictyon sp and the purple bacteria Rhodobacter ferrooxidans R ferrooxidans with lower saturation intensity is able to efficiently oxidize iron at rates of about pmol h cell at circumneutral pH and under light saturation conditions Hegler et al Photoferrotrophs display mechanisms preventing cell encrustation with oxidized iron Miot et al Saraiva et al Wu et al Presumably photoferrotrophs use a periplasmic cytochrome for cyclic electron flow and other for linear electron transfer Bird et al In Rhodopseudomonas palustris the pio iron operon is essential for phototrophic oxidation as it encodes apart from a membrane transport protein for small redox proteins such as Pio C and cytochrome c Jiao and Newman The latter is essential for cyclic electron flow whereas Pio C linearly transfers electrons from iron Bird et al Operons related to phototrophic iron oxidation are also described for other purple bacteria such as the foxEYZ operon from R ferrooxidans and R capsulatus also coding for proteins of similar functions as those encoded by the pio operon of R palustris Croal et al Saraiva et al Green sulfur bacteria are among the most ancient photosynthetic organisms Gupta Gauger et al Although it has been hypothesized that several Chlorobium species could perform anoxygenic photosynthesis in lakes g et al Chlorobium ferrooxidans strains KoFox and is so far the only GSB species whose photoferrotrophic ability has been demonstrated While all other GSB species can use various sulfur compounds as electron donors genomic analyses revealed that C ferrooxidans has apparently lost most genes involved in oxidation of sulfur compounds Frigaard and Bryant Heising et al showed that strain KoFox was able to grow photoferroautotrophically in with Geospirillum sp strain whose fermentation of fumarate to organic acids enhanced oxidation by KoFox Among other possible explanations acidification of the medium by organic acids could be responsible for this enhancement as this could increase the solubility and hence the bioavailability of iron Growth of photoferrotrophic KoFox is stimulated by the presence of silica which is possibly due to its influence on iron chemistry mediating encrustation patterns and interactions and reducing iron toxicity Posth et al Gauger et al On the other hand Chlorobium ferrooxidans strain KoFox is able to oxidize at very low light intensities with saturation at lux compared to saturations of lux for R ferrooxidans and lux for Thiodictyon Hegler et al The capacity of GSB to present spectral modifications in their pigments Borrego et al Chew et al and grow under a very dim light g of surface irradiance Overmann et al Manske et al enable GSB to thrive in deep zones of anoxic ferruginous basins where is available and light availability is still sufficient for a photosynthesis Ormerod et al making these organisms good candidates for performing photoferrotrophy in current Archean ocean analogs Although the possibility of has also been proposed Olson even as a possible previous step to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis Johnson et al Fischer et al so far no phototrophic bacterium has been found and supporting evidences for photosynthesis are Jones and Crowe Even chlorinic photosynthesis mediated photolytic oxidation of aqueous chloride to form halocarbon or dihalogen products coupled with CO has been proposed as a potential metabolism on exoplanets under conditions that may approximate to the terrestrial Archean Haas Photoferrotrophy in Modern Water Columns Occurrence and Significance Apart from the information preserved in the geological record knowledge about the metabolisms supporting life on ancient Earth e g anoxygenic photosynthesis can be gained by studying environments that are considered as of different states of the ancient ocean Burns et al Most meromictic lakes and other permanently stratified water bodies are euxinic i e anoxic and sulfidic below the chemocline Zadereev et al Sulfidic basins of stratified lakes and closed seas might resemble the sulfidic ocean of the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic Contrastingly sulfide poor anoxic layers of stratified lakes are the most similar modern environments to the Archean oceans where photoferrotrophy could have played a crucial role in governing the biogeochemistry and providing energy to drive microbial growth and evolution et al Ferruginous water columns are rare largely unexplored ecosystems of which only freshwater representatives exist today because of the high sulfate concentrations in the modern ocean In recent years a few lakes have been described and studied as possible Archean ocean analogs providing insights on how ancient photoferrotrophs could flourish in the Archean ocean and on their possible role in its biogeochemistry Koeksoy et al reviewed the biogeochemical characteristics of some of these environments and paid special attention to iron chemistry and the usefulness of such systems to interpret Precambrian BIF deposition According to the current knowledge the most appropriate Archean ocean analogs are natural meromictic lakes Meromictic lakes show a permanent stratification whose bottom water which has higher concentrations of dissolved salts Imboden and does not mix with the overlaying waters due to the water density gradient and other factors linked to climate lake morphometry and water flow Boehrer et al In meromictic lakes the high monimolimnetic iron concentrations contribute to the water column stability which drove Kjensmo in his seminal manuscripts to use the term However the strongest density gradient in these lakes is commonly owed to dissolved compounds other than iron g calcium bicarbonate Rodrigo et al In stratified lakes the interface between oxic and anoxic water bodies the oxycline is accompanied by a steep gradient of iron forms the Bravidor et al In addition to iron meromictic lakes temporally stratified lakes have also been proposed as possible study sites as ancient ocean analogs Specifically these are the holomictic gravel Lake Vechten in the Netherlands Koeksoy et al as well as dimictic Boreal Shield lakes and from the Experimental Lake Area in where molecular microbial and stable isotope data suggest that these lakes may be also good candidates to be studied as analogs of ancient oceans Schiff et al In Table we summarized the basic characteristics of most of the currently described meromictic ferruginous lakes Mining lakes were excluded because of the acidic pH and strongly different biogeochemical conditions Boehrer et al The best studied ferruginous systems are the lakes Pavin Matano La Cruz and the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu Republic of the Even though most of these lakes show maximum iron concentrations largely overpassing those estimated for the Archean ferruginous oceans Table iron concentrations at the photic anoxic zones of the lakes are lower likely with higher resemblances to those estimated for the Archean ocean Holland Canfield Canfield et al However although it can be stated that iron was present at relatively high concentrations there is a high uncertainty in the estimation of the iron concentrations in the Archean ocean so only categorical comparisons can be made with some confidence On the other hand some of these lakes are also known to accumulate high concentrations of methane and CO in the bottom waters Crowe et al which might cause catastrophic limnic eruptions similar to what occurred in the African Lakes Nyos and Lagos Zhang and Kling Katsev et al Lake Pavin Lake Pavin is a meromictic circular crater lake in the French Central Range et al Its permanent chemocline starts at m depth and below the anoxic monimolimnion extends to the lake bottom In summer a thermal stratification additionally occurs et al Although sulfide is detectable in the anoxic waters the high iron concentrations of up to l cause most of the sulfide to be in the form of colloidal iron sulfide et al Meanwhile isotope studies showed that most of the iron isotope variability observed in sedimentary pyrite can be tied to water column cycling foremost to the oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron Busigny et al In fact the sulfur cycle is one of the main active element cycles in this lake with Epsilonproteobacteria apparently also non photosynthetic sulfur playing a key role in the oxidative phase of the sulfur cycle et al rRNA gene sequences highly resembling the microaerophilic iron oxidizer Gallionella ferruginea were also abundantly retrieved in the upper part of the chemocline Lehours et al Interestingly a highly diverse community of unicellular eukaryotes mainly heterotrophic and mixotrophic microbes that could benefit from the abundant and diverse prokaryotic community Lehours et al was found in the permanently anoxic zone of Lake Pavin et al Methane is produced in the anoxic zone of the lake though mainly in the sediments most of it not reaching the atmosphere as a consequence of being oxidized mainly by aerobic methanotrophs Lopes et al such as Methylobacter et al Although Lake Pavin has been considered as an Archean ocean analog phototrophic iron oxidation has not been studied in detail in this lake It is expected however that photoferrotrophy is of negligible importance due to the relatively great depth of the chemocline Instead most research on microbial mediated in this lake has focused on facultative g microorganisms g Lehours et al Lake Matano The deep stratified Lake Matano being the largest deepest and oldest ferruginous basin known on Earth Crowe et al was the first modern Archean ocean analog extensively studied as a possible environment where photoferrotrophy could occur Crowe et al This tectonic lake which covers km is the headwater lake of the five morphologically diverse Malili lakes located on Sulawesi Island Indonesia Lake Matano and the even larger Lake Towuti whose ferruginous sediments have also been recently studied Vuillemin et al are the biggest lakes in this lacustrine district Despite weak temperature and vertical salinity gradients stratification persisted over centuries in Lake Matano aided by the low temperature fluctuations in this equatorial area during the year and by the steep morphometry of the lake basin Water renewal in the monimolimnion is estimated to take several hundred years Katsev et al A deep pycnocline located at about m separates an oxic upper layer from bottom waters which are poor in sulfur but rich in methane and reduced iron with originating from the soils in the catchment Crowe Phosphorus limitation controls primary production in the oxic layers of Lake Matano Crowe et al which allows light penetration to the chemocline at m depth where reduced iron is available for a potential photoferrotrophic activity adapted GSB containing e thrive in the photic chemocline of Lake Matano Initial calculations based on sulfide availability suggested that the population densities of GSB could not be maintained by anoxygenic photosynthesis alone Accordingly Crowe et al proposed that a photoferrotrophic metabolism was implied to sustain their growth However GSB in Lake Matano are light limited and direct evidence for a photoferrotrophic activity could not yet be provided Instead more recent estimations Crowe et al showed that the growth and rates suggest that the Lake Matano GSB can be supported by sulfide even though it only accumulates to scarcely detectable concentrations Moreover barcoding community data demonstrate that GSB in this lake are related to known phototrophs Bryant et al rather than to GSB Since either photoheterotrophic growth or the use of H as an electron donor could also support growth additionally to that provided by or anoxygenic photosynthesis the possible occurrence of photoferrotrophy in the water column of Lake Matano would require stronger evidences Although apparently lower than previously reported g Crowe et al active methanogenic degradation of organic matter occurs in Lake Matano causing high methane accumulation in the anoxic bottom waters Crowe et al Even though recent modeling Kuntz et al estimated that most organic carbon sinking to deep layers is buried in the sediments ca is estimated to be degraded via methanogenesis and less than could be degraded by anoxic ferric iron respiration Part of the methane produced by both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenens by members of the order Methanomicrobiales Crowe et al is oxidized at the chemocline Meanwhile anaerobic methane oxidation may be coupled to the reduction of Fe and or Mn Jones et al or nitrogen oxides Sturm et al As in the ancient oceans the possible of photoferrotrophy methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation establishes Lake Matano as a modern analog potentially harboring the main microbial metabolisms that were driving life in ancient Earth Lake La Cruz Lake La Cruz de la is an biogenic meromictic lake located in the karstic system of del Hoyo The lake became meromictic around et al et al and is located in a doline with steep walls protecting the lake from winds The lake is small with a surface area of km a maximum diameter of m and a maximum depth of m A monimolimnion rich in Ca and Fe as well as in HCO CO and CH is located in the deepest part of the lake below a permanent chemocline starting at around m A seasonal thermal stratification develops in the warmest period and a temporary chemocline then appears from late spring to early summer above the permanent chemocline Rodrigo et al Steep chemical gradients are found both at the bottom of the metalimnion and permanently at the stable chemocline extends from to that separates the mixolimnion from the monimolimnion Figure The very low sulfide concentrations l at the chemocline Oswald et al compared to the high concentrations of dissolved reduced iron in the hypolimnion and the monimolimnion makes Lake La Cruz a potential Archean ocean analog were photoferrotrophy could occur FIGURE Physical and chemical features anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria biomass and anoxygenic inorganic carbon assimilation in the vertical profile of Lake La Cruz The two charts on the right correspond to a zoom of the grey area of those on the left and lines used are the same for the same Photograph of Lake La Cruz and light spectral penetration at various depths of the water column Redrawn from Picazo Surface waters of Lake La Cruz are depleted in nutrients as stratification advances then phytoplankton becomes nutrient limited thus increasing water transparency Picazo Light penetrates selectively to deep layers where sharply stratified planktonic populations of primary producers develop along the physical and chemical gradients of the water column Figure In the oxic and microaerobic layers the photosynthetic planktonic assemblage is dominated by picocyanobacteria resulting in a deep chlorophyll maximum at the bottom of the metalimnion during stratification

monimolimnion Rodrigo et al Romero et al Figure being dominated by the PSB Lamprocystis purpurea and the GSB Chlorobium clathratiforme Casamayor et al with the concomitant presence of Chlorobium ferrooxidans Walter et al Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria including some linked to the iron cycle Walter support important rates of dark inorganic carbon fixation that even exceed the contribution of anoxygenic photosynthesis to total carbon fixation in the lake Picazo Nevertheless inorganic carbon fixation in the lake is by far dominated by oxygenic photosynthesis with the highest rates of inorganic carbon fixation Figure occurring at the interface during the thermal stratification period Camacho et al has low concentrations along the water column of Lake La Cruz Soluble however is much more abundant in the anoxic waters being oxidized in both the seasonal and the permanent chemoclines Figure Aside of the possible chemical reaction with photosynthetically produced O and the oxidation by microaerophilic chemotrophs in the upper part of the chemocline photoferrotrophy likely occurs in anoxic waters Walter et al demonstrated that in the anoxic photic zone in situ inorganic carbon photoassimilation in presence of DCMU an inhibitor of the oxygenic photosynthesis thus avoiding oxygen was significantly higher in amended additions compared to batches and with those where sulfide or nitrate were added Figure This was observed only in the presence of light which supports that photoferroautotrophic processes do occur Moreover longer incubations of these anoxic samples in a climatic chamber with additions and DCMU also resulted in oxidation only when exposed to light Figure Similarly an enrichment culture of Chlorobium ferrooxidans showed the same behavior Figure The occurrence of anaerobic oxidation of in all these experiments represented the first consistent demonstration of photoferrotrophic activity at the chemocline of a modern Archean ocean analog However in Lake La Cruz photoferrotrophs C represent only a minor fraction of the anoxygenic phototrophic population with the majority apparently thriving on sulfur cycling despite the very low sulfur content in the ferruginous anoxic waters of the photic zone This majority could potentially follow a similar metabolic path as that described in Lake Matano Crowe et al within a cryptic sulfur cycle supported by the low concentrations of sulfide available at the chemocline where the low light availability could be growth of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria Additionally have also been found to be active at the chemocline where they coexist with potential competitors such as the photoferrotrophs who also utilize reduced iron as well as with potentially syntrophic organisms Walter The coexistence of phototrophic and could be explained by a niche separation with only oxidizing in darkness and phototrophs dominating oxidation in daylight Melton et al FIGURE In situ anoxygenic phototrophic amended

consisting of GSB closely related to Chlorobium ferrooxidans incubated under anoxic conditions either in the light or in the dark Modified from Walter et al The major biogeochemical processes operating in the lake are summarized in Figure The presented model integrates the iron carbon sulfur and oxygen microbial cycles including the metabolisms thought to have existed in the late Archean ocean Walter Lake La Cruz thus represents an analog of the late Archean ocean with oxygenated surface layers hosting oxygenic photosynthesis overlying a ferruginous anoxic water column holding anoxygenic photosynthesis and anoxygenic photoferrotrophy and with organic sediments where methanogenesis is the main organic mineralization pathway FIGURE Model of the iron cycle in Lake La Cruz Integration of the iron biogeochemical cycle with the oxygen and the sulfur cycle Below the epilimnion and metalimnion the chemocline compartment could be an analog to a Neoarchean ferruginous open ocean However as neither the deep monimolimnion nor the sediment compartment demonstrate any accumulation it could also be an analog to the euxinic ocean margins characterizing the Neoarchean ocean All processes from compartment are established along the chemocline The boundary between compartment and is conceptual and would be situated few centimeters above the sediment Regular lines indicate biological processes curved arrows illustrate diffusion sedimentation processes and broken lines represent chemical processes The Sediment compartment accumulates sulfur compounds as FeS am stands for oxygenic stands for stands for dissimilatory stands for stands for dissimilatory sulfate reducing stands for sulfide oxidizing and stands for methanogens Lake Kivu Lake Kivu Descy et al is a large km deep tropical meromictic lake located between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda This lake of tectonic origin is the highest of the East African Rift Lakes This is a very active geological volcanic area with hydrothermal influences on lake deep water layers which slightly disturb the meromictic conditions Katsev et al created by the vertical salinity gradient originated by salt inputs coming from subaquatic groundwater discharges Schmid and Ross et al The mixolimnion is separated from the monimolimnion where hydrogen sulfide accumulates to concentrations of ca mM Pasche et al et al by a permanent chemocline located at m et al Large amounts of methane and CO accumulate in the deep monimolimnion with the corresponding risk of limnic gas eruptions Zhang and Kling Hirslund However methanotrophs mainly close relatives of type X CH bacteria Pasche et al very actively oxidize methane Morana et al mostly aerobically in the oxycline driving low methane release to the atmosphere Morana et al Zigah et al Nutrient availability in upper layers is low with average mixolimnetic concentrations of mg m Phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms during the dry season and by cyanobacteria mainly picocyanobacteria Sarmento et al during the rainy season with total phytoplankton biomass of g C m y Darchambeau et al The microbial communities of Lake Kivu have been studied in several basins of the lake et al Plasencia et al and their stratified distribution suggest functional specialization et al with highest microbial richness in the anoxic zone et al species of GSB permanently developed at m depth in Kabuno Bay and sporadically in the anoxic waters of the main basin et al Kabuno Bay where in situ photoferrotrophy has been reported et al is separated from the main basin by a shallow volcanic sill that restricts water exchange with the main basin Kabuno Bay with a maximum depth of m has a steep pycnocline around m depth Katsev et al with a very narrow oxycline and a ferruginous water column below with up to mM of deriving from hydrothermal sublacustrine sources et al Light penetrates well into the sulfide poor maximum in the illuminated anoxic waters with GSB comprising up to of the total microbial community in the chemocline Anoxygenic phototrophs also include PSB and Chloroflexi though being less abundant The e GSB were isolated and sequenced being closely related to Chlorobium ferrooxidans strain KoFox strain Anoxygenic phototrophs largely dominated CO fixation in the illuminated redoxcline of Kabuno Bay Morana et al oxidation rates of up to Fe l d have been reported et al at the chemocline much higher than those reported for lakes Matano and La Cruz Table and the photoferrotrophic contribution to CO fixation in the Kabuno Bay of Lake Kivu by these anoxygenic phototrophs was significant A tightly coupled pelagic cycle was observed with much higher rates than those of sulfate reduction and potential sulfide oxidation et al Actually rates of photoferrotrophy in the Kabuno Bay water column mol C m yr are within the range of those modeled for global photoferrotrophic production in early ferruginous oceans mol C m yr et al Contrasting to C ferrooxidans KoFox the Kabuno Bay GSB isolate appears to be specifically adapted to the pelagic habitat contains e instead of c and grows in pure culture instead of in Incubation experiments with the Kabuno Bay isolate also demonstrate its capacity to grow photoferrotrophically under very low light conditions e E m s apparently oxidizing at a rate of mmol l d et al Some Concluding Remarks and Perspectives Our knowledge on photoferrotrophy and its past and current significance has tremendously increased in the last decade We now have evidence from pure cultures as well as from environmental studies that this metabolism could have been a significant process in the early times of our planet but also that it remains as a relict example of how this primitive Earth may have been functioning during hundreds of millions years These advances likely place photoferrotrophy among the oldest photosynthetic processes on Earth probably playing an important biogeochemical role during most of the Archean Eon It has also been demonstrated that oceans evolved from predominantly reduced to the current oxidized conditions Interestingly these primordial anoxic ferruginous conditions still prevail in environments such as the meromictic lakes The study of these modern analogs of primitive oceans has revealed that in many of them GSB related to Chlorobium ferrooxidans are the main photoferrotrophs but also that the current ecological and biogeochemical significance of photoferrotrophy is minor Moreover even when photoferrotrophs are abundant in an anoxic iron rich natural environment sulfur driven anoxygenic photosynthesis still plays an important or dominant role despite the typically very low sulfide concentrations in ferruginous systems This in addition to the fact that bacterial anoxygenic photosynthesis is restricted to small compartments of the modern biosphere implies that the current ecological relevance of anoxygenic photosynthesis is circumstantial Exploring photoferrotrophy however provides insights into how photosynthesis appeared on Earth and how it progressively shaped the biogeochemistry of our planet Author Contributions AC

with these terms Diverse communities of bacteria colonize plant roots and the rhizosphere Many of these rhizobacteria are symbionts and provide plant growth promotion services protecting the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing plant productivity by providing access to nutrients that would otherwise be unavailable to roots In return these symbiotic bacteria receive carbon in the form of sugars and organic acids from plant root exudates PGP activities have been characterized for a variety of forest tree species and are important in C cycling and sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems The molecular mechanisms of these PGP activities however are less In a previous analysis of Pseudomonas genomes we found that the bacterial transportome the aggregate activity of a bacteria s transmembrane transporters was most predictive for the ecological niche of Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere Here we used Populus tremuloides Michx seedlings inoculated with one of three Pseudomonas fluorescens strains and and one Pseudomonas protegens as a laboratory model to further investigate the relationships between the predicted transportomic capacity of a bacterial strain and its observed PGP effects in laboratory cultures Conditions of low nitrogen or low phosphorus availability and the corresponding replete media conditions were investigated We measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of P tremuloides seedlings and correlated P fluorescens transportomic capacities with P tremuloides seedling phenotype to predict the strain and nutrient transporter functions that lead to experimentally observed strain and PGP activities and the capacity to protect plants against nutrient stress These predicted transportomic functions fall in three groups transport of compounds that modulate aspen seedling root architecture transport of compounds that help to mobilize nutrients for aspen roots and transporters that enable bacterial acquisition of C sources from seedling root exudates These predictions point to specific molecular mechanisms of PGP activities that can be directly tested through future biological experiments aspen computational modeling nitrogen phosphorus plant growth promotion Pseudomonas transportomics U S Department of Energy Introduction Forest ecosystems are major components of the biosphere and contribute extensive ecosystem services Trees form a significant storage sink in the global carbon cycle facilitate water fluxes in the hydrologic cycle and provide wood and fiber for human consumption The provision of these benefits depends upon the supply and utilization of resources dioxide water nutrients and to and by the tree However photosynthesis and primary productivity are often limited by nutrient availability et al Reich et al St Clair et al which in turn affects the ecological roles and economic output of forests The plant rhizosphere hosts a large and diverse community of microbes whose interactions with roots and soils influence ecosystem productivity et al Morgan et al Cumming et al Interaction between roots and plant growth promoting bacteria specifically play critical roles in enhancing the acquisition of nutrients from soils for the plant host and enhance host niche breath and stress resistance and Fraga Barea et al Compant et al While some aspects of the resource exchange underlying PGP interactions have been described et al Lambers et al et al an increased understanding of these interactions would enhance potential management applications such as biofuel feedstock production soil remediation and C sequestration activities Pseudomonas fluorescens is commonly found soil bacteria and abundant operational taxonomic units in Populus rhizosphere samples et al Brown et al Many P fluorescens strains are categorized as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Cook et al These benefits may be accrued from changes in nutrient availability in the rhizosphere alterations in host hormonal balance increasing stress resistance and or changes in the community of microbes interacting with plant roots et al Cumming et al Some proposed molecular mechanisms for PGP activity include the export of organic acids and siderophores that facilitate dissolution of P in soils et al Giles et al Pastor et al and the secretion of phosphatases and phytases that mineralize organic P in the plant rhizosphere et al Pastor et al Pseudomonas strains have nutrient PGP effects on a variety of crop and tree species including Solanum lycopersicon et al Nicotiana tabacum et al Oryza sativa et al and Malus domestica et al These effects on plants can be in significant part attributable to differences in Pseudomonas transportomes et al Larsen et al Transportome is defined here as the relative capacity to transport specific substances across the cell membrane as a function of the set of transmembrane transporters in the genome An investigation of these differential transportomic capacities of PGP strains and of their correlation with measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of Populus tremuloides seedlings would highlight potential molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizosphere community s specific contributions to plants acclimation to stress C sequestration capacity and the maintenance of productivity under suboptimal conditions We have evaluated the effect of four different strains of Pseudomonas on P tremuloides aspen seedlings in replete media and under conditions of low nitrogen and low phosphorus The evolutionarily distinct Pseudomonas strains we chose for this study were and et al Silby et al Kimbrel et al Loper et al Sixteen phenotypic measures of aspen seedlings were collected and computational models of Pseudomonas metabolism related to each strain genome were generated By identifying significant correlations between seedling phenotype colonized by a Pseudomonas strains with transportomic capacities under different nutrient stress conditions we were able to predict molecular mechanisms of strain and nutrient PGP Methods Aspen seedling and Pseudomonas resources P tremuloides Michx and strains of P fluorescens were cultured together in a laboratory model system Aspen seeds were obtained from the National Tree Seed Center Natural Resources Canada Fredericton NB Canada The four Pseudomonas strains used in this study were P protegens Type Cell P fluorescens et al P fluorescens et al and P fluorescens et al Aspen Pseudomonas vertical plate cultures Aspen Pseudomonas communities and aspen controls were grown in a vertical plate system under three nutrient regimes replete low nitrogen and low phosphorus Experiments were performed using replicate vertical plates per treatment and aspen seedlings per plate for a total of plates and aspen seedlings All data are reported as averages of seedling values from each replicate vertical plate Aspen seeds were surface sterilized by washing once with Tween and sodium hypochlorite followed by several washes of sterile water Sterilized seeds were soaked in sterile water in the dark overnight and germinated in jars product containing Phytablend Laboratories Inc for day Jars were maintained in a growth chamber with h light dark cycle with photosynthetically active radiation of m s temperature regime of and constant relative humidity before being transferred to the vertical plates Dishes Following the d germination period seedlings were transferred to a vertical plate system with one of three nutrient treatments Replete media contained mM NH NO mM CaSO mM K SO mM MgSO and mM KH PO media substituted NH NO of replete media and media substituted KH PO of replete media Solution pH was adjusted to with N NaOH in each case Each vertical plate contained ml of solidified media with half removed to create a headspace for seedling shoots Washed autoclaved cellophane membrane Gel Drying Film REF was placed on the half medium Seedlings were transferred carefully from the germination jars to the cellophane membrane Each plate contained seedlings placed at mm intervals The plates were incubated at a angle in the growth chamber under conditions noted above After incubation seedlings were inoculated with the Pseudomonas strains For inoculation into vertical plates Pseudomonas cultures were grown overnight in LB liquid media at Bacterial pellets were collected and washed with sterile mM MgSO Pellets were in Johnson s nutrient solution mM P mM mM K mM Ca mM Mg mM Cl Fe B Mn and Zn and Cu Na Co and Mo Solution pH was adjusted to with N Desai et al at an estimated bacterial cell concentration of nm Each seedling root was inoculated with of bacterial suspension or with of sterile Johnson s solution Seedlings were harvested days following bacterial inoculation for phenotype measurements As in previously published experimental results et al et al Majeed et al the biomass of bacteria was not collected at the end of incubation and the presence of bacteria was considered only as an experimental treatment in subsequent analyses Aspen seedling phenotype assays A total of phenotypic measurements were collected from aspen seedlings at the end of the experiment These included shoot dry weight shoot length number of leaves leaf chlorophyll concentration mg chl a b ratio shoot anthocyanin concentration mg shoot NO concentration g shoot P concentration g root dry weight root branching root length number of rootlets root anthocyanin concentration mg root total N root NO concentration g and root P concentration g Experiments were harvested after days of All plates were visually inspected for bacterial or fungal colonies and contaminated plates were discarded Plant phenotypes corresponding to physical parameters such as shoot length number of leaves root length root branching and number of rootlets were measured on all seedlings in at least replicate plates per treatment Phenotypes that entailed destruction of the samples such as dry weight and leaf chl chl a b ratio shoot anthocyanin shoot NO shoot P root anthocyanin root total percent N root NO and root P were measured on replicate plates per treatment For dry weight measurements seedlings were collected from each replicate plate dried at for h and shoot and root tissues separately weighed Dry tissue was also used for measuring P and total N concentrations Other biochemical assays chl chl a b ratio shoot anthocyanin shoot NO shoot P root anthocyanin root total percent N root NO were performed using two seedlings per plate per treatment Chlorophyll was extracted from whole shoots using cold methanol and quantified according to Porra et al Anthocyanins were extracted from root and shoot tissue separately with acidified methanol and quantified according to Neff and Chory All assays were adjusted relative to the original protocols to reflect lower biomass amounts and analyzed using a microplate spectrophotometer Devices Sunnyvale CA For analysis of tissue NO concentration dry root or shoot tissue mg dry was ground and suspended in O and kept at for h After cooling to room temperature samples were centrifuged and of supernatant was collected The nitrate in samples was converted to nitrosalicylic acid by reaction with salicylic acid in concentrated sulfuric acid and its concentration was then determined spectrophotometrically Total tissue N was determined on dried root mg dry by combustion with a Carlo Erba NA elemental analyzer Erba Strumentazione Milan using acetanilide as a standard To determine the P concentration of plant root and shoot tissue dried tissue was ashed at for h dissolved in of concentrated HCl ACS and the crucible rinsed with of O and combined with the digest The resulting digests were vortexed until clear and of sample diluted with O was used to detect inorganic P using the malachite green method et al Analysis of aspen seedling phenotypes Seedling phenotypes were analyzed using ANOVA with the factors being bacteria of and low N and low P of using http www org mev html Thresholds for significance were p based on permutations A matrix of Pearson s correlation coefficient scores between all aspen phenotype measurements across all experimental conditions was generated to identify strong positive and negative correlations between seedling phenotypic measures and percentile of PCC scores Strong correlations were visualized as a network http cytoscape org Principal component analysis was also performed on seedling phenotypic data Seedling phenotype were clustered by hierarchical clustering and grouped by PCA using Euclidian distance in R Important principal components were considered to be those whose variance exceeded what would be observed if variance were distributed equally across all PCs Relevant loading values in important PCs from PCA analysis were considered to be those whose absolute value exceeded number of Transportomic modeling Transportomic capacity of Pseudomonas strains was calculated as Predicted Relative Transmembrane Transport scores as described in Larsen et al Briefly all four Pseudomonas strains were for transporter and sensor functions to insure uniformity of annotations across strains using a custom database of protein sequences annotated with any of KEGG Orthology annotations Transporter sensor annotations are associated with one or more of possible ligands Function was ascribed to a bacterial protein if alignment with sequence similarity and e PRTT is a metric that quantifies the relative capacity of a bacterium to transport a ligand across its membrane as a function of the number of genes annotated with transporter functions in its genome A positive PRTT score indicates an increased relative capacity for transmembrane transport of a specific ligand in the transportome in one bacterium relative to the average transportomic capacity of a set of bacteria A negative PRTT score indicates a decreased relative capacity for transmembrane transport of a ligand A PRTT score alone does not necessarily indicate the direction of transport i e import or export and requires consideration of specific protein annotations Note that ligand identifications are drawn from the ontology of KEGG compounds and may contain redundant or overlapping terms g and necessitating additional investigation into the specific transporter proteins or annotations Table contains the necessary information for readers to make the required associations between ligand annotation and predicted Pseudomonas protein Correlations between aspen seedling phenotypes and transportomes Statistically significant correlations between significantly different phenotypes and transportomic models were identified As the transportomic models are dependent only upon Pseudomonas genomic annotation the matrix of PRTT scores associated with a Pseudomonas strain is the same regardless of media condition Three sets of correlations were considered Phenotypes significant by community for all media phenotypes significant for interaction for only low N stress and phenotypes significant for interaction for only low P stress condition Statistical significance of the correlations was assigned using a bootstrap approach randomly phenotypes times and determining the frequency at which absolute value of bootstrapped correlations was greater than absolute value of initial correlations This frequency was expressed as a p and a significance threshold of p was used As it is expected that this correlation network will contain false positive interactions the network was reduced by filtering for edges in the network between nodes that are significantly enriched for specific strain media condition or direction of correlations as a cumulative hypergeometric distribution p The filtered network is comprised of aspen seedling phenotypes and Pseudomonas transported ligands connected by statistically significant correlation edges All subsequent analysis was performed using this filtered network Results Aspen seedling phenotypic analysis Aspen seedling phenotypes were assessed under five conditions bacteria and three conditions low N and low A summary of collected quantitative phenotypes can be found in Table and the complete set of collected data can be found in Table Representative seedling vertical plate cultures are pictured in Figure By ANOVA media composition differentiated phenotypic characters separated by Pseudomonas community and by the interaction of media and community In aspen seedlings without Pseudomonas N and P limitation led to and reductions in total seedling biomass respectively Thus it is clear that nutrient resources limited aspen growth in the delivered low N and P treatments In addition the inoculation with four P fluorescens strains resulted in and average biomass increases relative to controls in replete nutrient conditions indicating that in aggregate the Pseudomonas strains confer PGP benefits Table Summary of aspen seedling phenotype measurements Media Replete Low N Low P p p p Community None None None Number of leaves ChlA ChlB Chlorophyll Shoot NO Shoot anthocyanin Shoot P

phosphorus Aspen seedlings inoculated with bacterial strains indicated on the left and grown under replete mM N mM or nutrient limiting conditions N low P indicated on the top of the image Low N and P conditions alter pigments in aspen seedlings Three phenotypic measures were solely influenced by media treatment chlorophyll chlorophyll a b root Table Considering average values across the community treatments total chlorophyll in seedlings grown with low N was of that in seedlings grown with replete media but the chlorophyll a b ratio did not change In contrast total chlorophyll in low P derived seedlings was intermediate between replete and low N plants yet the chlorophyll a b ratio was of that in the other media treatments Root anthocyanin concentration was strongly stimulated by both N limitation and P limitation across all treatments This effect was particularly strong in aspen seedlings where anthocyanin concentration increased in low N and in low P relative to replete condition However in replete media the presence of Pseudomonas strains increased to root anthocyanin accumulation These observations suggest that anthocyanin accumulation in aspen seedling roots can be induced by multiple environmental cues including nutrient limitation and the presence of bacteria Pseudomonas affects P acquisition in aspen Shoot P was the only phenotype solely influenced Pseudomonas community Across media conditions seedlings with and exhibited and greater shoot P content relative to seedlings without bacteria and did not differ from aspen Root P accumulation decreased in seedlings grown with low P relative to replete media of seedlings with all Pseudomonas strains elevated root P concentration relative to seedlings with strongest effect for strains and Taken in aggregate total P accumulation plant calculated as Root DW Root P Shoot DW Shoot was significantly greater in all Pseudomonas plants compared to plants and exhibited differences in the order control Pseudomonas and media have a combinatorial effect on aspen seedling phenotypes Most aspen phenotypes responded to combinations of media and Pseudomonas community or their interaction indicating that PGP bacteria mediate aspen response to abiotic resource availability PCA of seedling phenotypic data identified five PCs that together accounted for of the total variance The first two PCs which account for of the variance can be linked to specific culture conditions The first PC includes six phenotypic characters chlorophyll concentration leaf count shoot length shoot dry weight root and root Figure highlighting tradeoffs as aspen seedlings increased root elongation as a N acquisition strategy The second PC also includes root growth relationships and seedling N nutrition specifically feedbacks between tissue NO accumulation and root architecture separates anthocyanin responses and root P suggesting this PC encompasses aspen to P acquisition Graphically PCA clustering of data indicates a distinct grouping of data with low N low P and presence of Pseudomonas each having distinctive effects on aspen seedling phenotypes Figure Principal component analysis and hierarchical

seedling phenotype measure Pseudomonads provide benefits to aspen seedlings Patterns of aspen seedling shoot and root architecture and biomass indicate that Pseudomonads generally increase C allocation to roots under both N and P limitation relative to seedlings and these changes while variable among strains may underpin PGP effects Strain promoted an increase in several seedling shoot phenotypes number of leaves shoot length shoot in replete media condition However these positive effects were not observed under nutrient limitation where seedlings with performed similarly to seedlings Under N limiting conditions root length increased markedly and root mass decreased slightly in seedlings relative to replete conditions For seedlings grown in low N media and inoculated with and and to a lesser extent with root mass was increased to and root length declined to relative to seedlings Low N also reduced shoot length and shoot mass in seedlings relative to replete conditions Under N limitation and restored shoot length and shoot mass to levels greater than that of the control in replete media Under P limitation root length and root mass of seedlings decreased and respectively relative to replete conditions Strain was the most efficient at increasing root length and root mass under low P compared to treatments Strains and also had positive effects restoring root length and mass above the control with replete media Low P also reduced shoot mass and shoot length in seedlings relative to replete conditions Strain maintained shoot mass under low P to levels similar to that observed for Pseudomonas seedlings in replete media Of note these strains did not affect shoot length under P limitation Together these observations suggest that Pseudomonas treatments increase resource allocation to root and shoot in a manner under N and P limitation These PGP effects and alleviation of stress likely result from multiple and PGP mechanisms functioning under different resource environments Pseudomonas strains have unique transportomic capacities While statistically significant differences in aspen phenotypes suggest Pseudomonas beneficial effects that depend on nutrient availability the statistical analysis does not provide information on the molecular mechanisms underpinning these beneficial effects The relative transportomic capacity of Pseudomonas strains and were quantified using There are ligands in the calculated Pseudomonas transportome and the complete set of can be found in Table and is summarized as a hierarchical cluster and

networks In order to identify potential mechanisms by which the observed Pseudomonas differences in aspen seedling phenotypes might be linked to differential transportomic capacities we considered the correlation network generated between observed aspen seedling phenotype measurements and predicted Pseudomonas transportomes Aspen seedling phenotypes are not independent of one another Intuitively it seems likely that all aspen seedling phenotypes are not independent of one another For example root length and root dry weight might reasonably be expected to correlate as might be number of leaves and above ground shoot dry weight To better understand how Pseudomonas transportomic capacity might be linked to aspen seedling phenotypes we first considered how those seedling phenotypes might be interdependent on one another by constructing a correlation network between phenotypic measurements This network is comprised of nodes and edges Chlorophyll a b shoot P root N and rootlets do not appear in the set of significantly correlated phenotypes The network is comprised of three connected subnetworks mostly belowground phenotypes aboveground phenotypes and anthocyanins In the aboveground network shoot dry weight leaf count stem length and chlorophyll concentrations are positively correlated Root and shoot anthocyanins are positively correlated The belowground subnetwork is comprised entirely of negative correlations between root phenotypes and between root architecture length and dry and shoot NO concentration Figure Network of correlated aspen seedling phenotypes In this network nodes are measured seedling phenotypes solid edges indicate strong positive correlations and dashed edges indicate strong negative correlations The phenotypes for root and shoot P concentration do not correlate strongly with any phenotypes Correlations networks between aspen seedling phenotypes and Pseudomonas transportomes predict molecular mechanisms of PGP Possible mechanisms linking changes in seedling phenotype to relative differential transportomic capacity of Pseudomonas strains were sought by identifying significant correlations between transportomic capacity as and available in Table and phenotypes The initial network is comprised of a completely connected network with Pseudomonas ligands aspen seedling phenotypes and statistically significant p correlations between ligands and phenotypes Edges are categorized as positively or negatively correlated with the majority of statistically significant edges being positive correlations Ligands were categorized by the Pseudomonas strain with the highest for that ligand Highest ligands were fairly evenly distributed between and The complete correlation network was refined to include only enriched interaction classes and the resulting network was comprised of phenotypes and Pseudomonas transportomic functions linked by interactions Predictions of molecular mechanisms of PGP in subsequent

capacity and aspen seedling phenotypes colored by culture condition gray for replete media blue for low N media and yellow for low P media Discussion Interactions between aspen seedlings and Pseudomonas strains under varying nutrient environments provide insight into how PGP benefits of this rhizobacteria could be linked to the annotated function of transmembrane transporter proteins Key observations include low N and low P induce stress in seedlings under these experimental Pseudomonas can ameliorate nutrient limitation in strain and Pseudomonas strains have unique transportomic and there are significant correlations between aspen seedling phenotype and Pseudomonas transportomes From these analyses it becomes possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms underlying strain and effects of Pseudomonas PGP interactions Analysis of correlation network identifies potential PGP mechanisms There are two principle mechanisms by which Pseudomonas provides PGP effects to aspen seedlings that can be inferred from analysis of the correlations between Pseudomonas transportomic capacity and seedling phenotypes Pseudomonads may increase the availability of nutrients to the and or influence root architecture through release of regulatory compounds Pseudomonas increase nutrient acquisition to aspen seedlings Organic acids g citrate malate and exuded by roots mobilize mineral nutrients for uptake by plant roots and Darrah These benefits are best expressed when exudates alter mineral solubility equilibria in the rhizosphere The balance between organic acid transport and utilization by rhizobacteria may similarly contribute to nutrient dissolution and promote both root and shoot growth by increasing nutrient availability In the current study the transport systems of the Pseudomonas strains exporting organic acids and other siderophores are predicted to contribute PGP benefits However which had the highest PRTT score for organic acid transport did not confer a growth advantage to aspen seedlings relative to other strains although tissue P concentrations were high In our experimental system bacterial release of nutrients may not drive seedling response because the nutrients are all provided in inorganic soluble forms and are presumably available to the plant The availability of other ions not measured in aspen such as Fe may be altered by siderophores released by Pseudomonas and may have benefited aspen growth et al Shen et al Pseudomonas influences aspen seedling root architecture Pseudomonads had a significant effect on aspen root architecture branching and shoot biomass independent of media condition The strongest effects on Pseudomonas root architecture were by for root branching p and for rootlets p and these effects may have contributed to the shoot biomass gains in both p and p Table Changes in root architecture may have two consequences to PGP increasing root branching and rootlets promotes nutrient uptake by increasing the root surface area for absorption and may also provide a more favorable environment for Pseudomonas growth Molecules with potential transporters in the Pseudomonas transportomes that have been shown to influence root morphology include several of the sugars et al Stevenson and Harrington polyamines et al and glutamate and Forde These molecules and related compounds could be produced and released by Pseudomonas or alternatively produced by the plant and taken up and utilized by Pseudomonas Both of these processes may take place simultaneously into the rhizosphere of aspen and play roles in increasing root growth and surface area Pseudomonas may take up and utilize a variety of sugars commonly found in the root exudates g glucose xylose galactose and Walker et al Carvalhais et al enhancing its ability to grow and survive in the rhizosphere Pseudomonas may additionally produce auxin et al or alter auxin levels signaling pathways in the host root and Forde which would alter patterns of lateral root development et al From analysis of interaction network root biomass is also predicted to be influenced by the transport of the possible regulatory compounds tryptophan phenylalanine nicotinamide and lipopolysaccharides by Pseudomonas Tryptophan is a known plant growth promoter that interacts with bacteria and Bano Tryptophan is also a precursor to auxin biosynthesis and may mediate root architecture change through this pathway Phenylalanine induces secondary metabolism in plants et al Koca and Karaman Nicotinamide is a plant compound that can induce and regulate secondary metabolic accumulation and induce plant defense responses et al Mohamed et al Hashida et al Interestingly several of the sugars for which there are transporters in Pseudomonas have complex effects on anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis when supplemented in the media and Harrington In our study the observed increase of anthocyanin concentrations in replete media aspen seedling with Pseudomonas may reflect the plant response to the differential metabolism of some of these sugars by Pseudomonas In our vertical plate system increased root growth and surface area should increase aspen seedlings access to nutrients In the media both NO and H PO are soluble and limitations to their diffusion in agar are expected to be small Nonetheless while phenotypes such as tissue concentrations of NO and P did not reflect beneficial effect of Pseudomonas total P accumulation in aspen seedlings with Pseudomonas increased by to and final seedling biomass was correlated to rootlet formation It thus appears that one of the PGP effects of Pseudomonas is enhanced nutrient acquisition related to altered root architecture as reported previously et al Pseudomonas enhances colonization of the rhizosphere Some compounds transported by Pseudomonas may directly stimulate or repress the defense response of aspen seedling roots Markers of pathogenicity nopaline glucosamine and are all negatively correlated with shoot length in low P conditions Rhamnose et al and nopaline and octopine and Lippincott are markers associated with root crown galls Glucosamine is a component of chitin that may induce plant defense responses and Brunner and glucosame is also a nitrogenous compound known to be rapidly taken up by plant root Proline predicted to influence shoot biomass has been observed to induce stress tolerance in basil et al Other compounds that may be transported by systems coded in the Pseudomonas transportome may mediate positive interactions and or facilitate colonization between bacteria and roots Transport of lipoproteins lipopolysaccharides and fucose are all correlated with seedling biomass Lipoproteins are essential to forming biofilms and colonizing plant roots et al Ghafoor et al and lipopolysaccharides are known mediators between plant roots and soil bacteria et al Reitz et al Fedonenko et al Lipopeptides are regulatory compounds in Pseudomonas interactions that influence antimicrobial activity motility and biofilm formation et al Fucose is a component of plant root mucilage et al and is known to promote interactions with rhizosphere community and Gould Conclusions and future studies We sought to uncover potential molecular mechanisms underlying rhizobacterial plant growth promotion effects under conditions of limited N and P using a laboratory model of aspen seedlings and four strains of Pseudomonas and We demonstrated that our nutrient limited conditions produced measurable stress responses in aspen seedlings and that those responses were alleviated by Pseudomonas in a strain and fashion We propose that the alleviation of nutrient stress by Pseudomonas is due to three classes of ability functions to mobilize nutrients to direct aspen seedling root structure and to successfully colonize the rhizosphere These mechanisms are potentially linked to the transport of specific ligands which can be traced back to specific genes and proteins for transporters and sensors in Pseudomonas These results will lead directly to future specific biological experiments to validate predicted PGP transportomic mechanisms

cryptophyte prey particularly from species in the genera Geminigera and Teleaulax The sequestered prey nucleus and chloroplasts are considered to support photosynthesis of M rubrum In addition recent studies have shown enlargement of the retained prey nucleus in starved M rubrum and have inferred that enlargement results from the fusion of ingested prey nuclei Thus far however little is known about the mechanism underlying the enlargement of the prey nucleus in M rubrum Here we conducted starvation and refeeding studies to monitor the fate of prey nuclei acquired by M rubrum when feeding on Teleaulax amphioxeia and to explore the influence of the retained prey nucleus on photosynthesis of M rubrum Results indicate that enlargement of the prey nucleus does not result from fusion of nuclei Furthermore the enlarged prey nucleus does not appear to divide during cell division of M rubrum The presence of a prey nucleus significantly affected photosynthetic performance of M rubrum while the number of retained chloroplasts had little influence on rate of carbon fixation We interpret results within the context of a model that considers the dynamics of ingested prey nuclei during division of M rubrum nucleus enlargement photosynthesis sequestered chloroplasts sequestered nucleus Teleaulax amphioxeia Det Frie Introduction Mesodinium rubrum Myrionecta rubra is a common ciliate in coastal waters worldwide where it sometimes causes red tides Taylor et al Lindholm It is an obligate mixotroph requiring both light and prey uptake for sustained growth and survival Gustafson et al Yih et al Johnson and Stoecker Hansen and Fenchel Growth of M rubrum is to a large extent phototrophic and closely linked to irradiance Johnson and Stoecker Johnson et al Smith and Hansen Moeller et al Under culture conditions M rubrum feeds specifically on cryptophytes belonging to the genera Geminigera and Teleaulax Hansen and Fenchel Park et al Myung et al Hansen et al Raho et al It has long been known that Mesodinium rubrum contains chloroplasts of cryptophyte origin Taylor et al Hibberd Recent studies have shown that these chloroplasts are genetically similar to the prey on which M rubrum is fed indicating that chloroplasts are sequestered from the prey Johnson et al Hansen et al Myung et al Furthermore experiments in which prey were switched from one species to another led to the replacement of chloroplasts in M rubrum depending upon the available prey species Hansen et al Raho et al In starved M rubrum sequestered prey chloroplasts have been shown to divide along with cell divisions of the ciliate Johnson et al Hansen and Fenchel Kim et al Nevertheless M rubrum requires continuous acquisition of new chloroplasts and other cell organelles acquired through feeding for sustained growth Early works found that M rubrum contains a single enlarged nucleus of cryptophyte origin along with cryptophyte chloroplasts other cell organelles and cytoplasm Taylor et al Hibberd Oakley and Taylor This condition was believed to represent an incomplete endosymbiont and the enlarged cryptophyte nucleus was referred to as a Hibberd Oakley and Taylor Later however it was verified that the symbiont nucleus like the cryptophyte chloroplasts is acquired by M rubrum after feeding on prey Gustafson et al Johnson et al Johnson Hansen et al Kim et al and was termed by Johnson et al For simplicity the acquired prey will be called the in the remainder of the introduction The single symbiont nucleus observed in M rubrum cultures Johnson et al is eventually lost following cell divisions of the ciliate subjected to prolonged starvation Johnson and Stoecker Johnson et al Kim et al However the symbiont nucleus was still observed in all cells after the first cell division in prey starved experiments indicating that the acquired prey nucleus divide at least one time inside M rubrum Hansen and Fenchel Gustafson et al as well as recent papers by Kim et al and Nam et al showed that M rubrum retained additional prey nuclei which were smaller than the symbiont nucleus and of size similar to the nucleus of the prey species Also it has been observed that smaller prey nuclei become enlarged over time during prey starvation in M rubrum Johnson et al Kim et al Nam et al The interpretation made by the authors of these recent studies was that acquired prey nuclei fused to make the symbiont nucleus However this interpretation was not experimentally tested and the exact mechanism underlying enlargement of the acquired cryptophyte nuclei in M rubrum remains unknown In the present study the fate of prey nuclei sequestered by M rubrum was monitored during prey starvation and refeeding experiments using confocal microscopy Changes in size and position of prey nuclei inside the ciliate were determined and evidence of nuclear division or fusion was noted Furthermore the relationship between the presence of a retained prey nucleus and the photosynthetic efficiency and growth of M rubrum was studied Materials and Methods Cultures Cultures of Mesodinium rubrum and Teleaulax amphioxeia were established using single cells isolated from harbor Denmark in Both species were grown in f medium based on autoclaved seawater Guillard with a salinity of and maintained in tissue culture plates Both species were grown at in a temperature regulated room under a photon irradiance of photons m s and on a light dark cycle of Light was provided by cool white fluorescent tubes Irradiance was measured at the level of incubation flasks using a light meter equipped with a spherical quantum sensor and L Walz GmbH T amphioxeia was supplied as prey at a predator prey ratio of approximately when M rubrum was transferred weekly to new medium Experiment Starvation of Mesodinium rubrum The first experiment was designed to monitor the change in photosynthetic performance and the number size and position of prey nuclei during starvation of M rubrum M rubrum cells were kept for weeks by adding sufficient prey every days to a culture grown in a tissue culture flask After weeks of frequent feeding the M rubrum culture was allowed to deplete the prey and absence of prey in the culture was confirmed under an inverted microscope at magnification A portion of the but M rubrum and stock culture of T amphioxeia were then added to a ml tissue culture flask to achieve an initial predator prey ratio to and a M rubrum cell concentration of ml From this stock culture a aliquot was transferred to each of three tissue culture flasks The flasks were placed on a shelf with light coming from the side at an irradiance of photons m s Position of the flasks was changed sequentially once a day to minimize difference in light exposure between the flasks Subsamples for cell enumeration and assessment of photosynthetic performance were withdrawn from each flask on occasions during the experiment on Day and Figure For confocal microscopy a single Day sample was taken prior to distributing stock culture to replicate flasks with samples taken from replicate flasks on all other days pH was monitored at each sampling occasion directly in the flasks with a SenTix pH electrode connected to a pH meter pH and calibrated with pH and pH standard buffers Technischer NIST To avoid physiological effects of elevated pH in laboratory cultures Hansen half the volume of each experimental cultures of M rubrum was removed and replaced with fresh f medium on Day and when pH values were approaching to FIGURE Schematic illustration of experimental design used for

each flask were fixed in glutaraldehyde Millipore at for h Fixed samples were stained with a combination of ml Hoechst and X CellMask for min in a dark chamber then filtered through a black polycarbonate membrane filter and finally washed with fresh autoclaved seawater to remove excess dye A drop of immersion oil placed on both sides of a membrane filter was used to attach the filter to

Starved Mesodinium rubrum The second experiment was designed to monitor the changes in the number size and position of prey nuclei upon refeeding and subsequent prey starvation After taking subsamples on Day the three cultures from the first experiment were poured together in a tissue culture flask and then distributed to three tissue flasks T amphioxeia and new f medium was added to each of the three flasks to give predator prey ratios of and and then a subsample of each flask was transferred to each of three tissue culture flasks The triplicate flasks for each treatment were maintained as in Experiment with subsamples for estimating cell abundance withdrawn on occasions during the experiment and Figure Samples for measuring the size of prey nuclei inside of M rubrum were taken on Day

M rubrum at Different Prey Concentrations Immediately after the addition of prey EPNs were observed in M rubrum cells in all treatments Likewise when prey was depleted EPNs were no longer observed Figures Changes in the prevalence and number of EPNs were directly related to prey concentration The highest percentage of cells having EPNs was observed on Day or Day in the three treatments At low prey concentration to prey ratio of of M rubrum cells had a mean of n EPNs cell on Day Figure At moderate prey concentration to prey ratio of about of M rubrum cells had a mean of n EPNs cell on Day

observed on Day in the high prey treatment The refers to triplicate samples and EPNs were scored in at least cells in each sample At the start of the experiment less than of M rubrum cells had a CPN but the prevalence of cells with a CPN increased after refeeding exceeding on Day in all treatments Figures Changes in the occurrence of cells with a CPN however showed different patterns across the treatments of prey concentration At the lowest prey density the prevalence of a CPN declined after Day as cells underwent division Figure while at moderate prey density prevalence of a CPN remained above from Day to as cells divided times and then decreased Figure At the high prey concentration prevalence of a CPN was maintained above while cells divided five times to Day and then decreased Figure Changes in the prevalence of CPNs relative to the number of cell divisions were dependent on initial prey density The percent cells with CPNs declined after three cell divisions in the low prey

in the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum and epifluorescence micrographs of M rubrum cells from the high prey treatment of Experiment after staining with Hoechst and CellMask Green M rubrum feeds on three cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia cells as prey and obtains the nuclei of each prey One of the EPN moves toward the center of the ciliate anterior to the three ciliate and becomes enlarged The other two EPN transfer to daughter cells through cell division respectively After first cell division one daughter cell has a CPN derived from one of the EPN This daughter cell is divided into new daughter cells having a CPN or not by a second cell division Meanwhile the other daughter cell has a CPN with one EPN In case of this daughter cell it is divided into new daughter cells through a second cell two daughter cells and have a CPN respectively Each CPN moves in the same way as before following a third cell division As a result only three cells among the eight daughter cells have a CPN after the third cell division The series of epifluorescence images show temporal differences in the arrangement number and size of ingested prey nuclei after feeding starved M rubrum with T amphioxeia Day days

Table the volume of CPNs was about twice that of EPNs present in M rubrum at the same time Over the following days the frequency distribution for CPNs shifted toward larger size classes with the peak occurring in the size class on Day and in the size class on Day A total of ENPs were examined for the experiment none of which appeared to be in the process of fusing with another EPN or a CPN While dividing M rubrum were common in Experiment none of the CPNs examined for Day to Day appeared to be undergoing division Discussion Presence of Extra Prey Nuclei and the Centered Prey Nucleus The ciliate Mesodinium rubrum has for long been known to harbor prey cytoplasm and cell organelles including chloroplasts mitochondria and nuclei through feeding on cryptophytes Taylor et al Hibberd Oakley and Taylor Initially it was believed that this represented a reduced permanent but recent molecular studies have indicated that this is not true There is now clear evidence that the cryptophyte organelles and cytoplasm are identical to the prey that the ciliate is fed g Johnson et al and that the chloroplasts from one cryptophyte species can be exchanged with chloroplasts from another species Hansen et al Previous publications have used transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy to document the presence of small in or large in prey nuclei Hibberd Oakley and Taylor Johnson et al Kim et al Nam et al Those reports are limited to observations of only one type of prey nucleus inside individual M rubrum cells and provide little information about how M rubrum retains different sizes of prey nuclei Kim et al however suggested that small prey nuclei fuse to form a large prey nucleus Similarly Nam et al reported that small nuclei sequestered from prey were enclosed in a single membrane and suggested that small nuclei moved to the center of the M rubrum cell and fused to form a single large prey nucleus Our study documents that along with two ciliate macronuclei and one ciliate micronucleus M rubrum cells can simultaneously have multiple small peripherally positioned prey nuclei that we call extra prey nuclei and a single large centrally positioned prey nucleus EPNs were slightly larger diameter than the mean size of the prey Teleaulax amphioxeia nucleus diameter The CPN was always located at the center of the cell as also shown for the large prey nucleus reported in previous studies Hibberd Hansen and Fenchel Kim et al Nam et al and was generally much larger than the EPNs The CPN however showed considerable variation in size during our experiments depending on prey concentration and incubation time The CPN size was relatively stable in M rubrum supplied with plentiful prey diameter but increased dramatically during starvation averaging in diameter days after depletion of prey Formation and Enlargement of the CPN Eighteen days after depletion of prey of the M rubru m in our study lacked a CPN and none possessed EPNs but both types of nuclei were reacquired by a majority of the cells upon refeeding EPNs appeared in most cells within h and increased in number over time with maximum mean number cell ranging from one to five depending on the amount of prey provided Up to EPNs were observed in individual M rubrum EPNs occupied a peripheral position in the cell whereas recently sequestered CPNs were located at the center of the cell had a mean diameter similar to that of recently acquired EPNs present in cells at the same time Four days post feeding depending on prey concentration of M rubrum cells had a CPN with mean diameter of larger than an EPN but smaller than the CPN of cells Calculations based on mean diameter indicate that the volume of CPNs is about twice that of recently acquired EPNs raising the possibility that CPNs arise from fusion of two EPNs However fusing of multiple EPNs to form a CPN seems unlikely since none of the more than EPNs observed in our experiments were closely clustered or appeared to be fusing with another EPN It seems more probable that CPNs form by the relocation of a single EPN to the center of the cells accompanied by and or followed by an increase in size that does not result from fusion with another EPN One may wonder how the CPN of M rubrum increases in size over time As mentioned in the introduction enlargement of the centrally positioned prey nucleus was reported by Johnson et al Kim et al and Nam et al and suggested in the latter two papers to result from the fusion of smaller ingested prey nuclei Data from our starvation refeeding study however do not support that hypothesis for several reasons First of the more than EPNs and over CPNs examined during our experiments fusions of an EPN with a CPN was never observed If enlargement of the CPN were to be a slow process fusion events might occur infrequently and thus not be observed in our samples Enlargement of CPNs in our starvation refeeding study however appeared to be a rather rapid process as indicated by the observed upward shift in size classes of CPNs from Day to Day and Day Second during both of our experiments CPNs showed a dramatic increase after prey had been depleted and continued to enlarge even after the number of EPNs cell had dropped to undetectable levels Enlargement of CPNs when prey cells were not available to be ingested and when EPNs were not present in M rubrum cells indicates that CPNs can enlarge without fusion with EPNs Third once prey were reduced to very low or undetectable levels the number of total ingested prey nuclei ml remained stable as the number of EPNs ml decreased Were the disappearance of EPNs to result from fusion with CPNs then the total number of ingested prey nuclei ml would be expected to decrease Fourth if enlargement of CPNs were to result from fusion with EPNs then it would be reasonable to expect the size of the CPNs and the rate of CPN enlargement to depend on the number of EPNs that are retained In our starvation refeeding study however the size CPNs was similar in all treatments even though the maximum mean number of EPNs cell showed a fivefold difference In addition enlargement of CPNs progressed faster in our lowest prey treatment where maximum mean number of EPNs cell was one than in our moderate and high prey treatment where maximum mean number of EPNs cell was two and five respectively Figure Our results support the alternative hypothesis that CPNs are formed by the relocation of a single EPN from the periphery to the center of the M rubrum cell where it becomes part of the nuclear complex and increases in size without fusing with EPNs Under that scenario EPNs remaining at the periphery of cells after formation of a CPN might be digested or might be distributed to daughter cells during division of M rubrum where they would be available to form a CPN The latter possibility assumes that CPNs do not divide along with the ciliate as our data suggest If EPNs are distributed to daughter cells to form CPN then the mean number of EPNs cell would influence the number of cell divisions that could occur without a decline in the frequency of M rubrum with a CPN That seems to be the case in our starvation refeeding experiment as M rubrum in the low medium and high prey treatments had a maximum mean number EPNs cell of and divided and times respectively before showing a drop in CPN frequency Lack of Division and Disappearance of the CPN Our results imply that the CPN of M rubrum does not divide Not only did we fail to observe indications of division in any of the more than CPNs examined CPNs of dividing M rubrum were indistinguishable from the CPNs of cells Also CPN prevalence decreased with division of host cells as prey were depleted suggesting dilution of CPN cell due to lack of CPN division As mentioned above the total number of ingested prey nuclei ml as prey were depleted remained relatively constant due to apparent transformation of EPNs into CPNs Were CPNs to have divided during that time total ingested prey nuclei ml should have increased Hence during cell division of M rubrum the CPN appears to be inherited by only one of the two daughter cells The lack of the ability of M rubrum to divide the CPN has previously been reported by Johnson et al During prey starvation they found a disappearance of the CPN kleptokaryon in their in M rubrum over time and could estimate a half time of its disappearance Hansen and Fenchel and Kim et al asserted that the CPN in M rubrum is able to divide at least once in prey starved cultures since cells that had undergone one cell division all had a CPN Based on our observations however their results could be explained by the retention of EPNs prior to cell division and distribution of EPN to daughter cells to generate CPNs rather than by division of the CPNs Through the present study enlargement of the CPN was inferred to result from an increase in size of only one EPN However one question still remains to be answered what causes enlargement of the CPN Prior studies Hibberd Kim et al Nam et al have provided ultrastructural images of the enlarged prey nucleus e within M rubrum Here the chromosomes seemed to be untangled or less dense the nucleolus had a large size and large amounts of nucleoplasm surrounded the expanded nuclear envelope We also observed similar morphological changes of the CPN under the confocal microscope with less dense chromosomes and an enlarged nucleolus present in large irregular shaped CPNs Supplementary Figure The chromosome just seemed to be loose or swollen but the possibility of replication cannot be ruled out Surprisingly two enlarged nucleoli were found in one CPN a phenomenon that also appeared in the study of Johnson et al Nevertheless our quantitative data do not indicate that M rubrum can replicate the CPN and the results seem inconsistent with a recent study by Qiu et al They observed gene transcripts for prey nucleus replication on field populations of M rubrum Since their study was carried out on field populations it is difficult to interpret their data It is possible that M rubrum population they studied function differently than those isolates from Korea Denmark and Antarctica that have been studied in detail in laboratory culture After all six clades of the M rubrum M major species complex have been described recently Herfort et al Johnson et al However it is also possible that the M rubrum population studied by Qiu et al functions similar to the ones studied in detail in the laboratory but the authors may have simply caught M rubrum cells that recently ingested a diving cryptophyte cell Future studies will show which of the two interpretations are right Prey Nucleus Effects on Photosynthetic Ability of M rubrum Mesodinium rubrum is unique among the marine alveolates for its ability to sequester prey nuclei and chloroplasts along with other organelles and show enlargement of the prey nucleus once sequestered While sequestration of nuclei and chloroplasts along with other prey organelles is well known for a few dinoflagellates species Dodge Farmer and Roberts Horiguchi and Pienaar Okamoto and Inouye Gast et al Yamaguchi et al Onuma and Horiguchi Kim et al enlargement of the sequestered prey nucleus has not been reported in any of studies The sequestered prey nucleus has been inferred to allow the host cell to exploit photosynthetic performance of its sequestered prey e g the dinoflagellates Amylax triacantha Nusuttodinium aeruginosum and N myriopyrenoides and the ciliate M rubrum Johnson and Stoecker Johnson et al Kim et al Onuma and Horiguchi A few molecular and transcriptome studies focusing on the photosynthetic ability of M rubrum in association with the sequestered prey nucleus Johnson et al et al Kim et al have shown expression of algal genes Subsequently the retained prey nucleus was suggested to mainly contribute to sustained chloroplasts function Johnson et al Hansen et al et al Kim et al It has previously been shown that photosynthetic activity in different M rubrum strains declines in prey starved cultures Johnson and Stoecker Hansen and Fenchel Johnson et al It has also been shown that the declines in photosynthetic parameters coincided with the loss of CPN prey from M rubrum cells implicating a possible functional role for retained prey nuclei Johnson and Stoecker Johnson et al Our work confirms that the presence of a CPN substantially affects the photosynthetic performance of the M rubrum chloroplasts A reduction in prevalence of the CPNs in starved populations of M rubrum led to a significant decline in inorganic carbon uptake while chloroplast number cell showed little change This result might help to explain the formation of the the position could facilitate the gene exchange related with chloroplasts targeted genes for stable photosynthesis between the host nuclei and prey nucleus Martin et al Martin and Herrmann Even though our results imply that a CPN is involved with photosynthetic ability of M rubrum it cannot be ruled out that the ciliate nuclei also participate in the photosynthetic ability of M rubrum We do not know whether retention of a CPN and chloroplasts derived from prey in M rubrum is an evolutionary step toward establishing permanent chloroplasts but M rubrum is notable for showing the unique photosynthetic performance from the acquired chloroplasts and nucleus of prey Hansen et al proved that M rubrum chloroplasts derived from T amphioxeia can be replaced by chloroplasts derived from T acuta Whether or not the sequestered prey nucleus was simultaneously replaced however remains unknown Addressing the possibility of replacement of the prey nucleus in M rubrum may enhance our understanding of sequestration enlargement and function of the prey nucleus inside M rubrum Model for CPN Maintenance and Increase in Size Based on the results of our study we propose the following model to explain the dynamics of acquisition enlargement and distribution of prey nuclei to daughter cells in Mesodinium rubrum When M rubrum having only three ciliate nuclei micronucleus and two macronuclei positioned at the center of the feeds on the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia prey nuclei e are acquired at the periphery of the cell The number of acquired nuclei is equal to the number of prey ingested Figure Subsequently one of the EPNs relocates to the center of the cell anterior to the three ciliate to become a CPN thus forming a CCN complex The newly formed CPN is small at first but continuously increases in size over time without fusing with EPNs that persist in the cell With division of M rubrum the enlarged CPN does not divide and is inherited by only one of the daughter cells with the other daughter cell having the possibility of receiving one or more of the persisting EPNs If the daughter cell lacking a CPN receives one or more EPNs then a single EPN relocates to the center of the cell to form a CCN complex and a CPN which enlarges over time The inherited CPN continues to enlarge until reaching maximum size as seen in starved M rubrum Once the inherited CPN senesces it can be replaced by a new CPN if one or more EPNs are present in the peripheral cytoplasm of M rubrum or are acquired through feeding Conclusion Our study show that the sequestered prey nucleus associated with the CCN complex Nuclear of M rubrum is derived from a single prey nucleus enlarges over time without fusing with other ingested prey nuclei does not divide and is inherited by only one daughter cell when M rubrum divides Also EPNs present in M rubrum possessing a CPN can be inherited by and form a CPN in the daughter cell that does not receive the parental CPN How the system of M rubrum works when the ciliate is fed a mixture of prey species is unknown Will M rubrum then contain two CPNs or can one CPN control the chloroplasts from two species To elucidate this development of species specific molecular techniques is required Our study was conducted using M rubrum isolated from Danish waters while reports of fusion of ingested prey nuclei to form the enlarged prey nucleus e of the CCN complex Kim et al Nam et al was based on a Korean strain of Mesodinium cf rubrum Since our Danish M rubrum and the Korean M cf rubrum differ at the strain level and may even represent different species it is possible that the two cultures process ingested prey nuclei in different way Additional studies using the Korean isolate of M cf rubrum and other isolates of M rubrum from other parts of the world may help to resolve this issue Author Contributions All authors were involved in the design and planning of the experiments MK carried out the experiments collected data

cropland therefore traits that improve plant water capture water use efficiency and resilience to water deficit are necessary to maximize productivity A crop modeling framework APSIM was adapted to predict the growth and biomass yield of energy sorghum and to identify potentially useful traits for crop improvement APSIM simulations of energy sorghum development and biomass accumulation replicated results from field experiments across multiple years patterns of rainfall and irrigation schemes Modeling showed that energy sorghum s long duration of vegetative growth increased water capture and biomass yield by compared to short season crops in a production region Additionally APSIM was extended to enable modeling of transpiration traits that reduce crop water use under high vapor pressure deficits The response of transpiration rate to increasing VPD was modeled as a linear response until a VPD threshold was reached at which the slope of the response decreases representing a range of responses to VPD observed in sorghum germplasm Simulation results indicated that the transpiration trait is most beneficial in hot and dry regions of production where crops are exposed to extended periods without rainfall during the season or to a terminal drought In these environments slower but more efficient transpiration increases biomass yield and prevents or delays the exhaustion of soil water and onset of leaf senescence The transpiration responses observed in sorghum germplasm increased biomass accumulation by in years with lower summer rainfall and the ability to drastically reduce transpiration under high VPD conditions could increase biomass by on average across all years This work indicates that the productivity and resilience of bioenergy sorghum grown in environments could be further enhanced by development of genotypes with optimized transpiration traits and deployment of these crops in water limited growing environments The energy sorghum model and transpiration trait implementation are made available to simulate performance in other target environments energy sorghum vapor pressure deficit limited transpiration crop model environments biomass APSIM U S Department of Energy Introduction Predicted increases in world population and development by are projected to increase the demand for food forage biofuels and from agriculture by and Cohen Bruinsma Hall and Richards Crop production requires substantial water resources due to the linkage between photosynthetic CO uptake assimilation and transpirational water loss through stomata et al Insufficient water supply is a major cause of low crop productivity annually and periodic drought can cause large disruptions in agricultural output Boyer et al Therefore to meet future demand for agricultural products crops with improved water capture water use efficiency and drought resilience are needed to enhance sustainable production et al Vadez et al Sorghum bicolor is a versatile drought resilient grass crop that currently is used to produce grain and forage on more than ha Sorghum crops are particularly important for subsistence farming in the tropics Bioenergy sorghum is a relatively new type of sorghum hybrid crop designed for long growing seasons to enhance biomass yield et al Olson et al Gill et al The development of high biomass sorghum hybrids was initiated following discovery of a breeding system that allows production of late flowering hybrids from early flowering inbreds and Aydin Rooney et al Bioenergy sorghum hybrids have high photoperiod sensitivity due to the combined action of and that inhibit flowering in day lengths greater than h and Aydin Murphy et al Mullet et al Yang et al As a consequence energy sorghum hybrids that develop past the juvenile phase in the spring when day length are h do not undergo floral initiation until day lengths decrease below h in the fall The resulting long vegetative growth duration of energy sorghum hybrids combined with photosynthesis high radiation interception and use efficiency and annual cropping seasons that permit rotations and adjustments for economic conditions make energy sorghum hybrids a productive high biomass crop especially useful for growing regions et al Gill et al Mullet et al Sorghum is amenable to genetic improvement of hybrids due to a diverse germplasm good genomics platform and tractable genetics and Aydin Rooney et al Mullet et al Breeding and genetic improvement of bioenergy sorghum hybrids has been underway on a small scale for only years and as a consequence there are many unexploited opportunities for improving the crop s productivity and resilience One way to increase the rate of crop improvement is to use models to help identify physiological traits that have significant predicted yield benefits for optimization through genetic selection et al Hammer et al This approach was used in a prior study to examine the utility of increased leaf angle in bioenergy sorghum using modeling et al The predicted beneficial impact on biomass yield was confirmed by identifying leaf angle QTL and genotypes with varying leaf angle et al The integration of modeling modeling automated phenotyping and quantitative genetics is expected to further accelerate crop genetic improvement The Agricultural Production System SIMulator is a crop modeling framework that enables predictions of the growth and productivity of crop species under varying environmental conditions and management practices et al Keating et al Holzworth et al The sorghum module in APSIM has benefitted from continuous development and improvement since and Muchow incorporating established models of sorghum phenology canopy development growth and nitrogen use et al Rosenthal et al Birch et al Hammer and Muchow Chapman et al b APSIM has also been enhanced to model complex adaptive traits and genotype to phenotype predictions et al In addition to its record of providing accurate predictions of sorghum development and Muchow Kumar et al Hammer et al et al Lobell et al APSIM s modular design provides a flexible platform for examining the impact of variation in traits and physiological processes on plant development To date APSIM has been used predominately for modeling grain crops and additional work has demonstrated its efficacy in sugarcane et al APSIM should be similarly effective for examining biomass accumulation in bioenergy sorghum hybrids with long vegetative growth duration Therefore we extended the APSIM grain sorghum model to bioenergy sorghum and examined its performance relative to experimental data from field experiments across multiple years and patterns of rainfall and water availability Additionally APSIM was used to investigate the potential impact of traits that limit transpiration under high vapor pressure deficit in bioenergy sorghum VPD describes the difference in water vapor pressure within the leaf and the surrounding air Since transpiration rate increases with increasing VPD limiting transpiration under conditions of high VPD has been predicted to contribute to the water use efficiency of grain sorghum and corn et al et al Messina et al transpiration traits enable water conservation and improve water use efficiency by imposing a restriction on transpiration rate when VPD becomes sufficiently large et al Tardieu et al McAdam and Brodribb Previous experiments have demonstrated that transpiration is a genetically regulated trait in sorghum Some genotypes display differences in the linear increase in transpiration rate with increasing VPD whereas other genotypes display a VPD breakpoint defined as the VPD at which the slope of the linear response between VPD and transpiration rate decreases et al Choudhary et al Choudhary and Sinclair Riar et al These sorghum genotypes respond to high VPDs by reducing their transpiration rates effectively limiting water loss under environmental conditions that result in low transpiration efficiencies thereby increasing overall crop water use efficiency The transpiration trait may be especially beneficial for bioenergy sorghum hybrids that are grown in regions subject to high VPD and water limitation Any daily advantage that the trait confers would potentially be compounded over extended periods of high VPD and water deficit that occur during the crop s long growing season Moreover enhancing the resilience of energy sorghum by increasing the crop s tolerance of long periods of water limitation will enable the crop to utilize intermittent rainfall for growth and biomass accumulation Furthermore future climate change modeling predicts increases in VPD that will be detrimental to vegetation et al McDowell et al therefore determining the potential beneficial impact of transpiration traits and potential on energy sorghum biomass yield and resilience is of great interest Previous methods for incorporating a limited transpiration trait into crop models imposed a and a maximum transpiration rate In grain sorghum transpiration was modeled as a maximum transpiration rate per unit leaf area such that the transpiration rate would plateau at the designated maximum regardless of further increases in VPD et al et al In maize limited transpiration was modeled as a piecewise function whereby at or above a designated VPD VPD transpiration rate would plateau and not increase further et al These models are characteristic of some sorghum genotypes but do not capture the full range of VPD modulated transpiration responses reported for sorghum et al Choudhary et al Choudhary and Sinclair Riar et al To capture this additional complexity we implemented a dynamic transpiration modification as part of an energy sorghum model in APSIM and used this modification to examine the effects of a range of transpiration traits on biomass accumulation Adapting APSIM for bioenergy sorghum and transpiration enables predictions of energy sorghum phenology biomass accumulation in a range of environments and agronomic practices and analyses of the impact of the transpiration on biomass accumulation Methods Crop model simulations for energy sorghum in APSIM The daily progression of sorghum biomass accumulation given environmental data and management practices was simulated using Agricultural Production Systems Simulator www apsim

obtained from the Daily Global Historical Climatology Network et al access date January The values of maximum and minimum radiation per day were obtained from and Minimum Radiation Incident On An Tilted Surface from NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy data set for Latitude Longitude https eosweb larc nasa gov The APSIM function was used to calculate annual average ambient temperature and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature The soil depth parameters were adjusted to be reflective of College Station TX where energy sorghum root systems rarely extend beyond mm below the soil surface This constraint was implemented by making the soil layer mm a water table that restricted root growth and water uptake past the soil layer Crop management practices used for modeling were based on standard methods for growing energy sorghum et al Olson et al Sowing each year was modeled to occur between April and May The sowing density and plant spacing in rows reflect practices applied in College Station TX in and with plants m and cm row spacing Fertilization was simulated to apply kg of nitrogen per hectare based on production practices described previously et al The unlimited irrigation regime was implemented using furrow irrigation between rows approximately every weeks if no rainfall occurred and less often when rainfall provided water for plant growth et al For simulations without transpiration irrigation of mm of water was applied on soil water deficit demand of mm as part of three irrigation scenarios no irrigation than starting with a fully saturated soil profile prior to sowing rainfall was the only water limited irrigation stops on July and unlimited irrigation on demand during the growing Adapting APSIM to model delayed flowering due to high photoperiod sensitivity Delayed flowering caused by very high photoperiod sensitivity is a trait that differentiates energy sorghum from most other sorghum crops As a consequence of this trait energy sorghum hybrids planted in central Texas in grow in the vegetative phase for days and initiate flowering in when day lengths decrease below h and Aydin The implementation of photoperiod sensitivity in the APSIM sorghum module is based on extension of thermal time in the vegetative phase et al Holzworth et al Therefore thermal time g photoperiod parameters were set to be consistent with observed time to floral initiation for energy sorghum hybrids such as grown in College Station Texas Modeling of energy sorghum hybrid performance other locations and latitudes could be implemented in a similar way by determining thermal time from planting until day lengths are h Table Parameter values for modeling canopy development and growth in the energy sorghum crop model used in this study

modified such that the model output generally resembled measurements of in et al Adapting APSIM sorghum module for transpiration traits In APSIM s sorghum model daily biomass accumulation is determined primarily from two inputs radiation energy intercepted by the plant canopy energy and soil water supply For a given day if water supply is not limiting the amount of radiation intercepted determines biomass accumulation Daily plant water demand is calculated from radiation energy supply The required amount of water for transpiration needs to be extracted by roots from the soil profile to maximize biomass accumulation If water available from the soil profile is less than the water required by the plant during canopy gas exchange for maximal biomass accumulation then water supply reduces daily biomass accumulation The amount of water utilized by the plant during gas exchange required for biomass accumulation is calculated from plant water demand when soil water supply was sufficient to meet demand or from available water supply when supply was less than plant water demand To extend this model transpiration was introduced into the calculation of potential change in biomass per day by impacting plant water demand as a function of VPD Daily weather input and biomass accumulation potential were interpolated at hourly timesteps and for each daytime hour the daily potential for biomass accumulation restricted by water was calculated as a function of hourly VPD This effectively introduced the ability for a plant to slow its transpiration rate under conditions of high VPD g in which case the plant would demand less water under conditions of high VPD Consequently this slowed the rate of biomass accumulation under conditions of high VPD and reduced the amount of water used in high VPD conditions when transpiration efficiency is low The calculations are described below and their implementation in the APSIM sorghum module is made available Code transpiration was modeled using the parameters vpd BP m m which are typically obtained from experiments quantifying transpiration Figure Table A transpiration trait can be characterized by a VPD breakpoint vpd BP the slope of the linear relationship between transpiration rate and VPD for VPDs that are less than the VPD breakpoint m and the slope of the linear relationship between transpiration rate and VPD for VPDs that are greater than the VPD breakpoint m these three parameters can be defined in the xml sorghum file provided by the user Given these parameters a daily biomass accumulation t s u n r i s e s u n s e t B t is calculated on an hourly t basis over the course of a day to In order to evaluate transpiration on an hourly basis VPD and biomass data calculated from radiation energy supply was

on the energy sorghum hybrid grown using three irrigation regimes a rainfed environment with no irrigation a limited irrigation scheme where plants were watered as needed until July in and and an unlimited irrigation scheme where plants were watered throughout the season in Above ground biomass was measured in both years and in data on stem height leaf number and leaf area index were collected After parameterization based on trait data APSIM simulations were compared to other years and irrigation schemes Growth simulations of energy sorghum for the unlimited limited and no irrigation conditions were qualitatively consistent with field data A photograph of typical field plot of at DAS grown with limited irrigation is shown in Figure The front of the plot has been removed revealing the onset of leaf senescence at lower levels of the canopy that is associated with nitrogen recycling to support production of new leaves at the top of the canopy et al The model largely tracked LAI height and number of leaves produced during the limited irrigation season The energy sorghum model also qualitatively reproduced the biomass accumulation trajectories observed in the limited and rainfed plots of and In and limited irrigation plots produced approximately kg m Mg hectare of dry shoot biomass and unlimited irrigation plots in produced kg m Mg hectare of dry shoot biomass Model predictions of biomass accumulation in with unlimited irrigation tracked field data for most of the season but predicted somewhat lower biomass accumulation late in the growing season a trend also observed when modeling biomass accumulation in under limited irrigation In the targeted management regimes of energy sorghum under strictly rainfed conditions the bioenergy sorghum crop model predicted biomass accumulation that was within the range observed in mechanical harvests of larger plots et al These results indicate that APSIM is capable of predicting growth and biomass accumulation trajectories observed in field experiments within the margin of uncertainty of available data on field grown bioenergy sorghum across multiple years and water supply conditions Figure

cropping season days after sowing The parameterized APSIM energy sorghum model was used to simulate how an energy sorghum crop would perform in the College Station Texas environment under different irrigation regimes and rainfall patterns over the annual growing seasons from to Using rainfall data from to in College Station three water input regimes were imposed unlimited limited and no irrigation As expected the crop s ability to accumulate biomass in the three treatments diverges between and DAS when water becomes limiting that is when water in the initially saturated soil profile is depleted B G I K Modeling showed that energy sorghum s long duration of vegetative growth allowed water capture from DAS to DAS and improved shoot biomass yield by in the production region relative to a crop harvested at DAS Fluctuations in rainfall and VPD during the growing seasons in College Station Texas are shown in Figure The amount and timing of rainfall was highly variable but generally decreased from planting to DAS and then increased again during the latter portion of the growing season Profiles of rainfall patterns in and show that rainfall between and DAS is intermittent and insufficient to recharge the soil profile In the location modeled average daily VPD increased from planting until DAS then declined until harvest at DAS VPD also fluctuates significantly on a daily basis Figure Increases in VPD generally result in higher rates of transpiration and water uptake from the soil profile by the root system and lower efficiency of conversion of atmospheric carbon to plant biomass per unit of water transpired D In simulations where water is not a limiting factor and transpiration efficiency is not influencing biomass yield energy sorghum is predicted to yield kg m of biomass while using mm m of water during a day growing season in College Station cropping environments In contrast in the absence of irrigation energy sorghum was predicted to produce on average kg m of biomass and used mm m of water The results of modeling indicate that water supply significantly limits sorghum biomass accumulation especially after DAS in this location consistent with field observations et al Gill et al Mullet et al Figure Seasonal fluctuations of rainfall and VPD and their relationship to sorghum transpiration rate and efficiency Distribution of daily rainfall and daily

are plotted along the sharing the of panel B transpiration trait parameters vpd BP m m is denoted in blue Modeling transpiration traits Transpiration efficiency decreases with increasing VPD et al Therefore the APSIM sorghum model was used to examine the potential utility of traits that limit transpiration at higher VPD for improving the biomass yield water use efficiency and resilience of bioenergy sorghum Previous experimental work demonstrated that transpiration traits are dependent on VPD and sensitive to kPA changes in VPD et al Choudhary et al Choudhary and Sinclair Riar et al Energy sorghum crops are exposed to a range of VPDs greater than kPA over the course of a day due to daily variation in temperature Figure Therefore the APSIM model was modified so that the calculated daily water uptake could be altered by a transpiration trait calculated in hourly timesteps an approach similar to that implemented by Sinclair et al et al and Messina et al transpiration traits were modeled using two different linear response slopes m and m where the transition between m and m is determined by a VPD threshold vpd BP denoted in The potential utility of genotypes with variation in m or m or combinations of and values of m was examined Modeling enabled the impact of various combinations of on the time course of biomass accumulation LAI development and soil water extraction dynamics to be investigated Modeling genotypes that vary in m that lack Modeling was used initially to investigate genotypes that vary in m slopes that lack a vpd BP Specifically m Choudhary et al m Choudhary et al m Gholipoor et al and a hypothetical extreme m were simulated using the transpiration modification with no vpd BP m m In fully irrigated conditions genotypes with higher values of m accumulated more biomass A modeled genotype similar to m accumulated almost twice as much biomass additional Mg compared to m under these conditions Values of m did not increase biomass accumulation Interestingly the genotype with an m accumulated less biomass during the first days of development in fully irrigated conditions compared to m however biomass accumulation by the two genotypes was similar between and DAS This occurred because later in the season when the genotypes reached canopy closure and VPD was higher both genotypes extracted the maximum available soil water each day Figure Energy sorghum biomass accumulation from to cropping seasons simulated in College Station TX with water supply regimes of unlimited irrigation and only rainfed Growth simulation of plants with no vpd BP m m are plotted with continuous colored lines that correspond to their m Cumulative biomass leaf area index and extractable soil water are plotted as the means and confidence intervals estimated with bootstraps for the respective rainfed and unlimited irrigation conditions In rainfed cropping conditions a genotype with an m of was predicted to yield approximately kg m approximately less biomass than in limiting conditions In rainfed environments increased values of m on average also resulted in higher biomass accumulation however the benefit of a higher m in water limited environments was much smaller than in fully irrigated conditions Mg While biomass accumulation was positively related to larger m values it came at the expense of leaf area development and maintenance under water limiting conditions During the first days of crop development genotypes with larger m accumulated biomass more rapidly in rainfed and fully irrigated environments compared to genotypes with lower m values The rate of LAI increase was similar in all genotypes until DAS because leaf area development in all genotypes was limited by thermal time in the model Genotypes with larger m values use water more rapidly therefore by DAS the genotype with an m had depleted of available soil water in rainfed environments more than the other genotypes For a genotype similar to lack of sufficient water supply in rainfed environments constrained biomass accumulation and leaf area development for the remainder of the season D Compared to a genotype with a genotype with an m genotypes with lower m values used water more slowly and accumulated less biomass in rainfed and fully irrigated conditions F In rainfed conditions slower use of water provided additional thermal time for canopy development before soil water was depleted resulting in higher LAI In rainfed environments modeling predicted that LAI would decrease once soil water resources were expended beginning about DAS E LAI declined sooner in genotypes with higher m because they used up water resources more rapidly Despite lower leaf area after days in rainfed environments genotypes with higher m accumulated similar amounts of biomass between and DAS on average over the years analyzed as the genotype with a lower m m Modeling energy sorghum genotypes with and variation in m The transpiration trait model was next used to model energy sorghum genotypes that regulate transpiration using a vpd BP where the slope of the transpiration rate response to VPD changes from m to m is characterized by a low vpd BP of kPA and the genotype s transpiration response to VPD is postulated to improve performance of grain sorghum in water limited environments et al To examine the physiological effect of s low vpd BP on biomass yield and water use efficiency of bioenergy sorghum in environments biomass accumulation of a transpiration trait that reflects the m and vpd BP of was combined with variation in m values Five m values were evaluated m the transpiration rate that was experimentally obtained from the genotype m a maximum transpiration rate which reflects how transpiration was modeled previously et al et al Messina et al m a response that reflects a lack of a vpd BP e m m m and m transpiration responses to VPD that were experimentally obtained from and genotypes by Gholipoor et al and Choudhary et al respectively In rainfed College Station environments the total biomass accumulated by each of the genotypes with investigated ranked from largest to smallest was kg m m kg m vpd BP m kg m limited m kg m m and kg m m Table In these simulations m marginally outperformed the genotype lacking a vpd BP over a year average by Table Table transpiration parameters m m vpd BP of genotypes used in this study Genotype m m vpd BP Literature Choudhary et al Gholipoor et al Gholipoor et al Choudhary et al Choudhary et al These values were experimentally obtained from their respective citations The relatively small improvement in biomass yield in genotypes with was further analyzed to identify that occur over the course of the growing season in the rainfed environments of College Station TX Figure The genotypes with a vpd BP have slower growth and biomass accumulation at the beginning of the season and accumulate more biomass during the latter part of the season Figure This shift in the timing of water use from early in the season to the summer months when VPD is higher may contribute to lower biomass yield even though the trait partially mitigates the influence of higher VPD Genotypes with the lower m reach a higher LAI between and DAS than the genotypes with the higher m Figure This trend in genotypes with higher m is correlated with a reduced rate of depletion of extractable soil water that allows for a longer period of canopy production Figure Most genotypes show a significant loss of LAI once soil water supply is depleted beginning between and DAS depending on genotype Figures F Genotypes with a low m such as maintain higher LAI for the remainder of the growing season Figure Since the transpiration trait has a negative impact on biomass accumulation during the early portion of the season but a potentially beneficial impact during the summer months a simulation was run where the trait was induced after DAS in a terminal drought environment to better understand the dynamics involved Figure In this simulation the transpiration trait reduced the rate of water utilization delayed the onset of leaf senescence and increased water use efficiency and biomass accumulation A genotype with no breakpoint accumulated kg m whereas genotypes with transpiration accumulated kg m between DAS until all soil water was extracted Simulations showed that induction of the transpiration trait under well watered conditions reduced biomass yield Figure Integrated modeling of The differences in biomass accumulation relative to timing of water limitation indicates that the benefits of the transpiration trait are greater when VPD is high and water supply is limiting during the cropping season To examine this dynamic further years in the College Station cropping environment were identified where the average rainfall per day fell below mm between DAS given a sliding window average B On average years with lower rainfall from to DAS also had lower total rainfall and higher average VPD Table Applying this criterion to rainfed cropping environments of College Station TX for and then evaluating the previous combination of m m and vpd BP indicated that the transpiration trait is beneficial in the more environments since transpiration plants with negative m parameters always yielded greater biomass Supplemental Table For example the sorghum genotype with maximum m on average yielded more biomass than a sorghum genotype lacking a vpd BP m m in the low yield environments Figure Moreover differences in predicted canopy maintenance was correlated with and may help explain why transpiration plants outperform their transpiration counterparts E In summary more restrictive transpiration responses associated with more negative m values perform progressively better in environments that lead to loss of canopy but progressively worse in higher rainfall conditions B Figure Performance of genotypes with transpiration traits determined in years with low and higher rainfall from to DAS and determined by canopy maintenance Boxplots show the biomass difference across years between genotypes with a transpiration trait and the genotype that lacks a vpd BP m The notches represent the confidence interval of the median The red square represents the means These statistics are plotted against end biomass accumulated by the genotype that lacks a vpd BP where the vertical sets of plots are separated by years categorized on the water supply condition and canopy divergence condition For the drought condition rainfall per day is calculated from sliding windows of days For sliding windows that center from DAS to if the average rainfall per day ever falls below mm then the year is considered a drought year The mean standard deviation and entire range of rainfall in sliding windows for the years considered low and high are plotted respectively The center of sliding windows evaluated for the water supply condition is highlighted orange For the canopy divergence condition where the vertical sets of plots are separated by the condition that occurs in the latter half of the cropping season For each year for each pairwise comparison between a genotype with and without a vpd BP and for each day in the latter half of the cropping season if the canopy of genotype lacking a vpd BP senesced and the genotype with a vpd BP maintained a larger canopy then transpiration genotype a vpd BP was predicted to out perform the genotype lacking a vpd BP LAI is plotted as averages of the conditions met and the range To examine the influence of all three parameters describing transpiration vpd BP and m were varied within the genetic range observed to date for sorghum and their impact on biomass yields given different m parameters were evaluated m A range of vpd BP values vpd BP representing the range bounded by and respectively and m values m the range bounded by and respectively were explored et al Choudhary et al Combinations of these parameters were simulated in rainfed College Station TX environments of cropping seasons The total biomass accumulated at DAS was used as a measurement of seasonal crop productivity These productivity landscapes illustrate the influence of transpiration traits and indicate that on average in the target environment of College Station TX m is the greatest driver of average productivity of the sorghum crop All simulated genotypes with an m produced more biomass than those with an m or regardless of m and vpd BP Contour plots of the three m values show that the extent of phenotypic variation introduced by the other two parameters m and vpd BP is influenced by the magnitude of m where the variation in cumulative biomass increases as m decreases Figure Landscapes of energy sorghum productivity for varying m m and vpd BP within the observed phenotypic parameters End biomass at DAS predicted from rainfed College Station TX was used as a measure of productivity m was varied to reflect the extremes and and a moderate transpiration rate m and vpd BP are evaluated for each m and the predicted average end biomass was interpolated to construct the topological surfaces The topology of each m surface is also plotted with contour lines to depict variation of end biomass at DAS The red star in panel D represents the transpiration parameters of The results of modeling show that genotypes with a high m accumulate more biomass when soil water resources are not limiting during the early portion of the season and that the trait is beneficial when water is limiting during the middle of the growing season when VPD is higher There may exist a theoretical m for m that would be predicted to increase productivity beyond the in the observed parameter space For an m the exploration of a theoretical m outside what has been previously observed for predicted that an m with a vpd BP would increase biomass by yielding an average of kg m in rainfed College Station TX This extreme m would be reflective of a genotype that essentially stops transpiration at VPDs higher than its vpd BP Furthermore observation of the fitness landscape suggests that it is not essential to find the exact combination of vpd BP and m but that there is a gradual ridge constructed by combinations of the two transpiration parameters that would improve biomass accumulation by This ridge shows the relationship between the vpd BP and m for increasing biomass by in rainfed College Station TX in the transpiration diagram where as vpd BP increased the range of m parameters that could be combined for beneficial productivity increases This relationship with vpd BP is likely related to the effect of VPD on transpiration efficiency TE which is inversely proportional to VPD through the TE c coefficient T E T E c v p d Figure Theoretical energy sorghum productivity landscape A combination of m representing a range of vpd BP values vpd BP representing and and a range of m values m beyond the observed genotypic parameters were evaluated for end biomass in rainfed College Station TX cropping environments and their averages are interpolated to create the topology of end productivity Discussion Crop modeling and trait analyses can be used to help identify constraints that limit plant productivity assess the benefits of traits and to increase productivity by optimizing crop deployment across variable environments Since energy sorghum is a relatively new grass biomass crop with an unusually long vegetative growth phase crop modeling could help identify traits useful to select in breeding programs The APSIM bioenergy sorghum model developed in this study was able to replicate the developmental time course of leaf area development leaf number plant height and biomass accumulation observed in field trials in College Station Texas Field data from other locations years and from newer energy sorghum hybrids would be useful to further validate and enhance the accuracy of modeling predictions In addition collection of detailed information on soil profiles root system development architecture rates of soil water extraction and information on water deficit induced changes in ABA levels would further improve the energy sorghum model and to enable modeling of root traits in conjunction with canopy architecture and traits Model evaluation was done using the College Station TX cropping environment a location with a long growing season and hot and dry summers where bioenergy sorghum hybrids are currently under selection in a breeding program In fully irrigated conditions modeling and field data show that energy sorghum has the genetic potential to accumulate Mg hectare per year et al However due to sorghum s water use efficiency and drought resilience during the vegetative phase it is likely that energy sorghum will often be grown in water limited environments less suitable for other crops Under rainfed conditions where the median rainfall over the growing season used for the simulations was cm bioenergy sorghum is projected to yield approximately Mg hectare per year This model prediction is consistent with the biomass yield of Mg hectare grown without irrigation in large plots that were machine harvested in and et al Modeling of energy sorghum production in this location based on environments indicated that energy sorghum would capture additional water resources and increase biomass yield by by extending the growing season from days typical of grain crops to days A crop designed to capture the additional water resources during a long growing season in this environment would benefit from high water use efficiency and resilience to water deficit Sorghum exhibits many useful traits for water limited environments including high cuticular wax deep rooting capacity induction of leaf rolling and osmotic adjustment in response to water deficit and transpiration traits et al In this study the APSIM bioenergy sorghum model was used to examine the utility of transpiration traits by evaluating the impact of VPD modulated transpiration in hourly intervals during the day The model extension was used to identify the benefits and associated transpiration traits during growing seasons using College Station TX environments as the context for this case study SD cm of rainfall per cropping season for Prior studies demonstrated that limited transpiration can result in improved grain yield in drought and heat stressed environments by shifting water utilization from the vegetative and booting phases to the anthesis and post anthesis phases where grain yield is more sensitive to water deficit et al et al Messina et al This change in the timing of water use improves harvest index and reduces the risk of large reductions in grain associated with water limitation during the reproductive phase et al The improvement is not attained if water is not sufficiently limited an emergent property associated with limited transpiration traits in grain sorghum et al Hammer et al We hypothesized that transpiration traits could also be beneficial for energy sorghum but for different reasons since the crop is harvested for biomass and grows most of the season in the vegetative phase The analysis showed that restriction of transpiration by reducing m or by transpiration involving low reduced biomass accumulation early in the season and that this had a negative impact on overall biomass yield There are several factors that could explain this prediction First at the start of the growing season the soil profile is saturated and excess rainfall is not captured due to run off until a portion of the soil water has been used for biomass production or is lost through evaporation In this part of the season modeling showed that genotypes with high m values like that accumulate biomass and use water at a high rate outperform genotypes with lower m values If a higher rate of biomass accumulation also results in more rapid leaf area development then this would increase the efficiency of radiation interception during the phase of canopy development However the results showed that a higher biomass accumulation rate did not influence LAI development a topic worth further investigation Second shifting water use for biomass accumulation from the early portion of the season when average VPD is lower to later in the season when VPD is higher and TE is lower reduces water use efficiency The negative impact of this shift in the timing of water use can be mitigated in part by limited transpiration traits However genotypes with current vpd BP and m values still use water at higher VPD in the summer although at lower rates compared to water used at lower VPD during the first portion of the planting season This interpretation is consistent with the predicted benefits of a theoretical m that completely shuts off transpiration above the vpd BP In that hypothetical genotype transpiration would be restricted to VPD below the breakpoint during the entire growing season mitigating the impact of shifting the seasonal timing of water use Third in high rainfall years transpiration could reduce the use of all available water resources for biomass production especially when significant rainfall occurs in the last days of the growing season These may help explain why in optimization simulations genotypes with higher m values and higher e m vpd BP were found to accumulate more biomass in the environments analyzed because these parameters allowed maximal biomass accumulation early in the growing season The value of vpd BP and m traits that restrict use of water during portions of the day with high VPD and low TE for energy sorghum was evident during the summer months when VPD is high and water supply is limited In a simulated summer terminal drought environment genotypes with this type of transpiration trait accumulated more biomass compared to genotypes lacking the trait consistent with higher TE Figure The trait also slowed the use of water and delayed the onset of leaf senescence that begins when most of the soil water supply has been depleted The delay or reduction in the extent of leaf senescence during summers with low rainfall would improve the crop s ability to use rainfall that occurs in the fall for biomass accumulation without the added cost and delay involved in rebuilding the canopy The value of the transpiration trait was also found to be higher in environments with more elevated VPD and lower rainfall Examining the rainfall distribution and its effect on transpiration trait impacts showed that in years when water supply was low during the summer months genotypes with m gained more biomass than genotypes lacking a vpd BP However in years with higher summer rainfall these genotypes generate less biomass illustrating the associated with this trait Table Efforts to identify optimal trait ideotypes for specific crops and environments has been promoted as a way to speed up the rate of crop genetic improvement For example a maize root ideotype that is steep deep and cheap has been identified and used to guide genotype selection and testing Consideration of the benefits and of transpiration in energy sorghum in this study suggest that a beneficial ideotype would a high m and rapid leaf area development during the early portion of the season to maximize biomass accumulation under conditions of low VPD and high water supply and induction of a transpiration trait m later in the season when VPD is higher possibly in response to water deficit Prior research showed that traits that limit transpiration can be environmentally triggered by changes in VPD et al Vadez et al McAdam and Brodribb by altering the level activity of root aquaporins and Sinclair and by foliar accumulation of the phytohormone abscisic acid et al Bauer et al McAdam and Brodribb McAdam et al that reduces stomatal aperture and plant transpiration and Davies Parent et al Boyer Cutler et al Stomatal closure can be further engineered via the ABA pathway whereby application of agrochemicals on plants expressing genetically engineered ABA receptors drastically reduces transpiration on demand et al Genetic engineering approaches like these may provide a means to design plants with inducible and more negative m that enhance biomass yield in water limited environments This type of genotype would be useful for environments that experience summer water deficit or terminal drought Determining target production environments for energy sorghum with transpiration will be critical for capturing the utility of the trait as well as in screening for energy sorghum hybrids that exhibit transpiration Given the ideotype described above selection for genotypes with high rates of LAI development and biomass accumulation during the first DAS combined with selection for genotypes that show delayed leaf senescence under water limiting conditions could be employed Numerous QTL for have been identified in sorghum and a subset of these loci may modulate that restrict transpiration at high VPD High resolution yield mapping and landscape models are being used to optimize crop productivity yield stability and return on investment by considering alternative distributions of available crops on perennial and annual cropland For example analysis of production regions in the US identified the potential utility of Miscanthus a high biomass perennial grass for perennial cropland et al In a similar way energy sorghum with its high biomass yield water use efficiency and resilience to water deficit could be usefully deployed in annual cropland landscapes including of fields that have shallow soils that are more often subject to water deficit The APSIM energy sorghum crop model could be used in conjunction with landscape design modeling to optimize utilization of this new high biomass crop In conclusion this study demonstrated that modeling of energy sorghum in the APSIM framework is able to track field growth and biomass accumulation in different environments extended the daily model to incorporate hourly transpiration found that transpiration can improve crop productivity in environments by increasing TE and by maintenance of crop canopies to enable utilization of sporadic rainfall and this model is made available for further evaluation of bioenergy sorghum production in other targeted environments and for other traits such as facultative CAM et al that could

which does not comply with these terms Increasing CO concentrations are strongly controlled by the behavior of established forests which are believed to be a major current sink of atmospheric CO There are many models which predict forest responses to environmental changes but they are almost exclusively carbon source e driven Here we present a model for an individual tree that takes into account the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth rates as well as control mechanisms within the tree that influence its diameter and height growth over time This new framework is built on understanding combined with differential equations solved by numerical method Our aim is to construct a model framework of tree growth for replacing current formulations in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models and so address the issue of the terrestrial carbon sink Our approach was successfully tested for stands of beech trees in two different sites representing part of a forest yield experiment in Germany This model provides new insights into tree growth and limits to tree height and addresses limitations of previous models with respect to growth tree growth vegetation modeling sink limitation source limitation height growth Introduction Forests are an important component of the global carbon cycle and are currently thought to be a major sink of atmospheric CO Pan et al Being able to predict the future responses of forests is therefore of great interest Many models have been used to address this issue but they are almost exclusively carbon with plants at any particular location treated as a pool or pools of carbon mainly driven by photosynthesis g Cramer et al Anav et al Friend et al However it is likely that many other factors such as the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth rates as well as control mechanisms within the tree have large influences on forest responses Fatichi et al A few research groups have addressed the issue of growth in a modeling context with respect to carbon sequestration The potential for growth to affect carbon storage and treeline position was addressed by Leuzinger et al using a global vegetation model However their approach was highly empirical and only addressed temperature limitations A more mechanistic approach was presented by et al in which a carbon balance model was constructed with both carbon source and sink parameterizations The sink parameterizations were based on and included different ontogenetic effects between tissue types and xylogenetic processes for secondary growth However while this paper makes a significant contribution the various parameterizations were very simply incorporated with no effect of moisture on wood growth fixed durations for xylem enlargement and no overall tree growth across years et al also presented a model parameterization that addressed the effect of growth processes independently of photosynthesis and in this case looked particularly at soil moisture effects However they did not explicitly treat meristem growth but instead used modified allocation coefficients depending on temperature and soil water Grossman and DeJong examined the consequences of explicit consideration of growth for growth partitioning through the growing season in fruit trees Sink growth was parameterized using a priority order and as a function of carbohydrate supply up to potential rates for different tissues which were modulated by daily temperature and season It was concluded that source and sink limit at different times of the year with carbohydrate supply limiting stem growth during the spring and autumn periods presumably related to the total sink strength being maximal at those times Derived from this type of approach a number of Plant have been developed which typically explicitly consider both source and sink functions et al While the emphasis of these models has been on allocation to plant form the focus on sinks makes them relevant for the debate and potentially useful tools to address it However as far as we know they have not been directly used for this purpose The LIGNUM model for example computes stem growth using available photosynthate in order to conform to the pipe model based on foliage area The tree grows as a coordinated whole and storage is not considered It has primarily been used to study the aspects of crown shape and light capture Most of the published growth and yield models that are routinely applied to forest ecosystem management and scenario analyses are based on statistical relationships between tree growth and environmental conditions et al Thus they inherently consider the sink aspect of growth in terms of parameterized relationships more than the source approach Examples are the individual tree models TASS et al SILVA et al PROGNAUS and Monserud SORTIE and Deutschman MELA and HEUREKA et al They represent successful but maybe too exclusively models in which new knowledge of tree responses to environmental conditions is difficult to integrate due to their empirical nature In contrast the generation of mainly models such as BALANCE and Pretzsch TREEDYN and and Waring represent hypotheses about mechanisms but so far are little established beyond scientific applications This is mainly due to the lack of evaluation and comparison with empirical growth and yield records In response to this current focus on modeling either taking the sink or the source aspect into account an integration of both seems most promising for taking forward understanding and prognosis of tree and stand growth Here we present a new framework for addressing tree growth responses to environmental change building on knowledge of tree physiology to develop approaches for predicting the development of an individual tree and thereby enabling a better understanding of forest responses to environmental change than purely models can achieve as well as addressing the limitations of previous approaches Our aim is to derive an approach that can be applied in global models specifically Dynamic Global Vegetation Models Therefore we seek the minimal level of detail necessary in order to compute behavior at the global scale and to be compatible with the other highly aggregated process representation in DGVMs In this paper we suggest that this objective can be realized using differential models that is to say growth models using differential equations We propose here a first differential model taking into account control mechanisms and the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth within trees together with the carbon balance as well as direct environmental controls on meristematic activity The paper is presented as follows First we make several hypotheses concerning physiological considerations then we give a description of the model We show how the model is used to predict tree height and stem volume in two sets of three different stands of beech trees Finally we discuss the results and the behavior of the model in several situations Model and framework General considerations To describe the development of the tree we suppose that it has two types of meristems apical and lateral and that the apical meristem increases the height through sustaining primary growth while the lateral meristem e the vascular increases the radius through sustaining secondary growth We recognize that trees will usually have many separate apical meristems distributed across many branches but for convenience we treat these together as one apical we also ignore apical root growth for now We further assume that the stem can be represented by a cylinder and that the crown e the branches and occupies a cylindrical volume and has dimensions that are proportional to the stem dimensions i e the crown depth is proportional to the height of the tree stem and its radius to the radius of the tree stem In this way we need only obtain information about the radius r and the height h of the stem to describe the growth of the tree Future developments will include introducing other crown and stem shapes as well as root meristems Here our objective is to keep the model as simple as possible in order to explore the realism of its fundamental assumptions In order to derive the dynamics of r and h we need three types of equations constitutive to the structure of the control of the intrinsic controls that the tree has on carbon balance to the balance of carbon between the tree and its environment and the balance within the tree Constitutive equations allometric relationships Physiologically plant growth is sustained by meristems producing new cells which subsequently enlarge and increase in mass We suppose that for each type of meristem growth is proportional to its volume that is to say that the mass of carbon allocated to a meristematic region will depend proportionally on the volume of meristem which determines the maximum potential production rate of new cells We also suppose that a tree controls the activities of the meristems and therefore the relative demand for carbon between the meristematic regions it can favor either height or diameter growth in this way depending on environmental signals Moreover we suppose that this is the only control the tree has on its growth With this hypothesis we soon get d h h d r r where is the ratio of activities between the apical and lateral meristems i e when the activity of the lateral meristem produces g of carbon growth g of carbon growth occurs from the apical meristem It is the control parameter Note that we suppose here that the volume of the apical meristem is proportional to the top surface area of the stem and that the volume of the lateral meristem is proportional to the lateral surface area of the stem This hypothesis is used as it is more realistic than assuming that the volume of the lateral and apical meristems are proportional to the volume of the tree i e that the thickness of the lateral meristem area increases proportionally with the radius and the thickness of apical meristem increases proportionally with height Although even under this alternative hypothesis we would get the same type of equation with being the proportion of growth per unit of volume of apical meristem relative to proportional lateral growth only adding a numerical coefficient in front of Knowing the definition of the volume and integrating we get the following constitutive equations h r M c g r h We recognize Equation as the usual allometric relationship where is a constant As it is true for any time t it can be expressed as h r with h and r the height and radius at some time origin t Equation is simply the definition of the volume of the stem plus canopy the branches and in relation to its mass M c We assume naturally that branches stem and leaves have different densities but for each of them we suppose that their mass is proportional to r h with potentially a geometrical coefficient That implies that the general mass is proportional to r h and in Equation g is the global proportionality coefficient Therefore g takes into account the density of the stem the density of the branches and foliage their contribution to the mass of the tree and geometric factors g can therefore be found using the proportionality coefficients we assumed between crown radius and stem radius and crown height and stem height and their relative densities Or if we call a the geometrical factors and d the densities g a foliage d foliage a branches d branches a stem d stem Here a takes into account the geometry and the volume of each element Control mechanism of the tree We want now to take into account the intrinsic control that the tree has on itself parameterized in our model by the ratio between the activities of the apical and lateral meristems For this we need to consider what happens physiologically convenience we use teleological the tree uses internal controls to be able to adapt its shape and physiology to the surrounding environment for instance other competing trees g Ritchie through phytohormonal signaling networks and Greb Aloni Many behaviors could be taken into account but here we focus on the behavior of a tree competing for light by trying to grow taller faster than its competitors by increasing The modeled tree is assumed to detect the presence of surrounding trees by sensing the ratio of downwelling red radiation e wavelengths between and to downwelling radiation e wavelengths between and A low ratio signals potentially more neighboring trees and therefore a potential threat of shading In that case the tree reacts by increasing the activity of the apical meristem relative to the lateral meristem while a higher ratio potentially means no threat and so the tree reacts by balancing the activities of the two meristems as it needs to compete less for light We hypothesize that this reaction can be modeled as exp R a Where is the highest limit for beyond which the tree breaks due to mechanical failure and R a is the ratio of received downwelling red ratio is a scaling parameter such that is the value of when the tree is unshaded e when it detects no other tree This approach is based on the findings of several studies g Morgan and Smith Franklin In particular Morgan and Smith observed the laboratory behavior of two similar young trees grown for days with the same intensity of photosynthetically active radiation but different red ratios They experimentally obtained a relationship which extended by limited development for short trees is coherent with the relationship we give in Equation A potential limitation to our approach is that we may not have access to direct measurements of R a For a lone tree this would not be a real problem the allometric relationship would be constant in our model and the red ratio maximal For individual trees growing in a stand in a forest however the situation is different as the trees shade each other Finding a dependency rule of the red ratio for trees in a stand is therefore a challenge that does not seem to be overcome yet Because of this and our desire to keep the model simple when we do not have access to measurements of the red ratio we make the assumption that is constant for each stand as it would be for a lone tree When the value of this constant is required it will be estimated as a typical value consistent with the empirical allometric relationship This is likely to be our most limiting factor as we are here trying to model the internal control that the tree has on itself which is probably the most complicated phenomenon to take into account and likely the understood component of our model Li et al Aloni Although the model seems to work realistically further work may require a more precise dependency of the red far red ratio Carbon balance The variation of carbon in the tree over time can be written as the sum of the carbon used for volume growth and the carbon stored d M tot d t d M c d t d S S g S h r d t where M c is the carbon used for volume growth S c S g S h r the carbon stored S is defined as carbon stored per unit volume of stem S c S S g S h r is the carbon stored above the storage limit S under which the tree is considered in danger This distinction has a physical interpretation and therefore in this model the density of the tree can then be seen as a standard density related to the carbon used for growth plus an increase of density due to the storage We also know that the variation of carbon is given by d M tot d t A Q C g T h r C h r C S g S c where A is the carbon assimilation due to gross photosynthesis minus a foliage respiration part proportional to photosynthesis while C is a constant grouping a part of the respiration and a litter component proportional to the volume together with the geometrical factor g that C g is the respiration and litter component We assume here that there is no other litter component that is to say that litter is completely proportional to the volume of the stem We note that this also means that the litter is proportional to the volume of the crown with our previous assumptions Also we assumed here that we are dealing with trees where the living volume can be approximated as proportional to the total volume This is an approximation and further work could include a variable corrective coefficient however this is a secondary issue compared to the main advance of this model concerning growth Finally C is the same type of constant but for the carbon storage A is assumed to depend on PAR Q the concentration of CO in the atmosphere C g temperature T water potential and the dimensions of the tree h and r Therefore d M c d t d S c d t A Q C g T h r C h r C S g S c The system is so far incomplete as there needs to be a relationship that controls which part of the carbon is allocated to growth and which part is allocated to storage Also the volume growth of the tree is sustained by meristematic cell division and enlargement with a maximal rate determined by intrinsic physiological limits or environmental controls We assume that the tree grows in volume as much as it can as long as it keeps enough storage to avoid being in danger such as for repairing damage and surviving poor growing seasons We assume that there is one tree specific storage pool although we acknowledge that localized storage with various turnover times are more realistic et al Palacio et al Richardson et al Therefore if there is enough carbon assimilation then the rate of growth is equal to the limit and the storage can increase using the difference of these two Also if the carbon assimilation rate becomes too low but there is enough storage then the storage delivers carbon to the meristematic region to maintain a rate of growth equal to its maximal sustainable rate Then density decreases as the carbon of the storage is used to maintain the volume growth This is likely to occur for instance when buds appear while photosynthesis is not yet high enough to support the maximal growth potential due to meristem reactivation that and other seasonal phenological phenomena are not yet treated by the However if there is not enough carbon assimilation or storage then the rate of growth is equal to the carbon assimilation rate and the storage per unit volume remains constant This behavior can be translated into evolution equations As growth occurs at a cellular level we can assume that the maximal meristem growth is proportional to the volume of meristems We denote this maximal growth per volume by R max the volume of the meristems by V me If there is enough photosynthesis or storage i e if A Q C g T h r C h r C S h r R max V me or S S then d M c d t R max V me S S S d S S g S h r d t A Q C g T h r C h r C S h r d M c d t but if A Q C g T h r C h r C S h r R max V me and S S then d M c d t A Q C g T h r C h r C S h r d S d t Note that the case where for some reason the carbon assimilation by photosynthesis is insufficient even to cover the cost of maintenance is treated by Equations In that case there will be a depletion of storage to sustain the maintenance cost until the storage reaches a critical level or until the photosynthesis rate increases sufficiently Modeling photosynthesis We assume the following dependencies of photosynthesis on water potential atmospheric CO concentration Cg PAR Q temperature radius and height Photosynthesis increases with CO concentration and PAR exponentially and tends to saturate A exp C g C r A exp Q Q r Cr and Q r refers to the critical constants As a first approximation photosynthesis of each leaf decreases linearly with a reduction in soil water potential We also suppose that water potential and hence photosynthesis decreases linearly with height A leaf h h h Where h soil lim R h With soil the water potential in the soil and lim the limit water potential below which any photosynthesis cannot be performed due to a lack of turgor pressure in the leaves and increased probability of xylem cavitation R h is the hydraulic resistance per unit length Overall for the whole canopy we suppose a dependency of the form A h h h h In particular this means that there are two antagonist effects one that tend to increase photosynthesis with the depth of the canopy due to more leaves and another that tends to make photosynthesis decrease with height due to the decline in water potential Note that is a numerical coefficient that depends on the ratio between the crown depth and the height We assumed in our simulations that Also the dependency of both height and water potential is given above We assume a dependency with temperature given by an asymmetric parabola A T T opt T i With T i being if T T opt and otherwise We set here T opt These values are inspired by previous studies g Precht et al We suppose that photosynthesis is proportional to the surface area of the crown and so proportional to r Overall we get A A max e C g C r e Q Q r T T opt T i h h h r h Maximal growth Intuitively as growth occurs at a cellular level we assume that the limit to growth per volume increases with temperature up to a certain temperature and increases with water potential Deleuze and Houllier Therefore we assume the following dependencies growth limit decreases with height as R max h h h h soil lim R h With soil the water potential in the soil and the limit water potential below which growth cannot occur Physically this gives us a maximal height h due to the limit on meristematic growth We define therefore R the reference maximal growth per volume independant of water potential by R m a x R m a x h h h We could also suppose that the limit to growth per volume increases with temperature using a standard Q formulation R m a x Q T T However seen the difficulty to know precisely Q and in order to keep the model as simple as possible we assumed that R remains constant with time As stated previously we suppose that the volume of meristems is expressed as V m e t r r h t where t is the effective thickness of the apical meristem and t is the effective thickness of the lateral meristem Final evolution equations Using the previous elements we finally get d M c d t R max h h h V me S S S d S c d t A max e C g C r e Q Q r T T op T i h h h C h r C S h r d M c d t or d M c d t A max e C g C r e Q Q r T T op T i h h h C r h C S h r d S d t depending on whether carbon supply from photosynthesis plus storage is sufficient to meet demand for growth and or not and Deriving the values of the parameters So far we need to know the values of the following physiological parameters to use the model A max g C C C S C r Q r h h t R max Table Numeric values of the parameters used in the model Symbol Value Quantity g kg m Density of carbon of the equivalent cylinder representing the tree C kg m y Respiration and litter coefficient C kg m y Respiration

meristem thickness h m Limit height of occurrence for photosynthesis h m Limit height of occurrence for growth S Critical value of the storage per unit mass A max kg m y Maximal assimilation of carbon per unit volume by photosynthesis Q r W m Characteristic PAR dependency Ratio of meristematic activity C r ppm Characteristic CO mixing ratio dependency Geometrical integrand for h T opt Optimal temperature for carbon assimilation The most accessible are probably Cr and Qr These are usually well known and can be obtained from the curve of photosynthesis activity as a function of atmospheric CO mixing ratio or as a function of PAR respectively A max can be obtained by direct measurements of the carbon exchange at a given height ambient CO concentration temperature PAR and compensating for respiration as in Campioli et al Acting similarly and measuring litter with litter traps gives access to C These values can also be deduced from net primary production and gross primary production and the typical litter flux rates Note that here we use data coming from forest stands although in the model we suppose that we have an individual tree without shading because data for lone standing trees are seldom available This means that we may underestimate the growth of isolated trees but at the same time the values of A max and C obtained enable to take into account the shading effect by neighbors of a forest with the same density which is a hidden parameter of this model e not explicitly taken into Also depending on the typical time length of the study we choose a model timestep and therefore we use averaged values of the parameters on this timestep In this analysis we chose year as the timestep although smaller timesteps could be considered Finding h is equivalent to finding the minimal water potential that can sustain photosynthesis h is its equivalent with respect to growth Combined these two parameters take into account all water limits in trees such as cavitation in the xylem conduits minimal turgor potential to maintain the shape of the leaf and enable stomatal opening etc While h equivalently has been extensively studied g Friend Koch et al Du et al and is believed to be equal to around m for redwood trees et al h seems to be less known However knowing h and the other parameters as well as the effective limit height for the considered species h can be estimated by assuming that it is the limiting parameter in regions with very good conditions for photosynthesis Therefore looking at the effective limit height would give access to h for these particular regions Using Equation and regressing on the water potential we would have access to lim and R h and therefore we would be able to estimate h in any region from a measure of soil We can find R max at least approximately by looking at the tree rings of many trees across several geographical locations and assuming that the largest ones correspond to the maximal increment dr achievable in a year which is directly linked to R the maximal growth rate under perfect water potentials Then we can deduce the value of R or at least its order of magnitude Results The model described above is ordinary first order and has no widely known explicit analytical solution in the case where is not an integer Therefore it was solved numerically by the method and Prince Coherence both with the analytical solution in simplified cases and with other solving methods e the trapezoidal rule and numerical differentiation was tested As some parameters can depend a priori on the considered species we derived the parameters explained previously for beech trees from the data provided in Campioli et al and Zianis and Mencuccini Beech trees were chosen because of their importance in European forests especially in Germany where they represent more than of the forest and in France where they comprise of the forest Therefore a great number of studies have focussed on beech trees enabling easier comparisons with our current study As the computation of the parameters is based on independent measurements that have sometimes a margin of error we allowed the parameters thus obtained to vary with a margin to account for this error and to allow a small adaptation of the model it is only a simplification of by fitting them with reference measurements of a standard beech tree stand in Fabrikschleichach Germany that we refer to as in the following As R was more coarsely estimated we allowed it a variation of in order to maintain the right order of magnitude Also as no precise data on the soil water potentials over the tested period A D were available for these stands we allowed a variation of h the height where growth cannot occur due to cell turgor limits We obtained then a final vector of parameters for our model using a method algorithm http uk mathworks com help optim ug html We then used our model to predict the time variation of height and volume of an average tree in other stands of beech trees It should be emphasized that there is a substantial difference between fitting and prediction Fitting a model to some data gives a partial understanding of the data but does not usually enable prediction for another tree or even for future data points as the fitting is done on a restricted set of measurements Prediction on the other hand is much harder to achieve as it supposes the use of parameters and environmental information g air temperature soil moisture CO concentration etc to predict the measurements Usually most models are fitted rather than predicting as it is much harder to predict anything without any fitting although when it works it gives much more information a better understanding and a reliable way to deduce future measurements before they occur even for other trees g height or volume On these stands the model was tested without any additional fitting In that sense it is at least partially a prediction Of course a fitting on these stands would give a better result than the results we obtain however it is not the goal of our approach This is the reason why in the figures to emphasize the difference of treatment between the standard stand and the others two labels appear and We first considered three stands of beech trees that are part of a experiment on forest yield science performed by the Chair of Forest Growth and Yield Science at the Technische The stands are in southern Germany about km from in the heart of the Steigerwald a richly forested hillside near a small village named Fabrikschleichach They cover roughly ha are located within immediate proximity of each other e they have experienced the same environmental and differ only in silvicultural management especially thinning with consequences for the development of stem densities during the experiment The beech trees were planted and then measured at irregular intervals averaging standard years from an age of y in A D to y in A D For each stand we considered the average height of the trees with the largest stem diameter at breast height The first stand was the reference stand used to partially fit the parameters the As the model needs initial values for both h and r and as measurements only started at an age of y all the computations were run starting at an age of y as can be seen in Figure Figure Size of the modeled tree with age at the first site Continuous curves are computed with the model while circles correspond to experimental measurements Represents the results of the partial fit on the reference stand Represent the results of the prediction with the parameters obtained by partial fitting As expected our partially fitted model agrees well with the measurements from this stand R Predictions with the model were then performed for the two other stands C The results give a very good prediction for the second stand R and a small although error for the third one R However this could be at least partially explained by the change in the density of trees during the y due to different rates of thinning in the different stands e from tree ha to tree ha in the first stand tree ha to tree ha in the second and tree ha to tree ha in the Therefore the red radiation ratio changes with time in the real forest while it was assumed constant in our model To complete the analysis by testing the model thus calibrated on another site where the conditions may be different it was also used to predict the height of dominant trees in three other stands at a different site in the Spessart Hain a low wooded mountain range in central Germany located approximately km from the first site where the beech trees were also planted and then measured from an age of y in A D to y in A D As data were missing concerning the water potential during the growth period from A D to compare with the first stand we allowed the model to adapt its value of h within by keeping the calibration derived previously and fitting only this one parameter on the first of the three new stands Then the new calibration was used to predict the heights of the three stands according to the model To avoid the potential error induced by the different variations of the red ratios within the stands we restrict our analysis to data when the density was lower than tree ha and started the simulations from these ages As before the predictions are in strong accordance with the observations for all three stands with a nearly exact correspondence with the measurements R R R except for the second stand Figure Plot of the size of the tree with age at the second site Continuous curves are computed with the model and start when the tree density is lower than tree ha while circles correspond to experimental measurements Parameters for beech trees are obtained from the first site and h was allowed to vary up to to compensate for the lack of data concerning water potential from A D on the two sites Panels represent respectively the results for stands We should note that the correspondence is very close but not exact and that the data we have might limit the accuracy firstly from our equations we can see that there is a propagation of error from the initial conditions An error on the initial height of m could imply an error of the predicted height of up to m after years even if the model were perfect Also no data were available for the difference of water potentials between the stands on a same site while it seems logical that for a certain density of trees the stands with higher density will have less water available per tree Therefore this could induce a small error in h and h that could be corrected if we knew the average water potential during the growth period in each stand To exam the sensitivity of the model to the initial condition we investigated how this impacts its predicting potential Figure shows predictions by the model for the second stand of the first site when we add an error on the initial condition for r between and with an increment of We also show the effect of combining this error on r with a error on h and a error on h Experimental measurements are represented in red In Figure we show the result of the model with a full range of error for r and h between and with an increment of while the experimental measurements are again represented in red In these simulations some knowledge on the experimental measurement is still necessary as we need to known the allometric relationship a priori However we could avoid this assumption by estimating it for instance using the allometric relationship of the first stand used for partial fitting Figure would not change much the result of this procedure is given in Figure Of course the prediction is likely to be more precise if we knew more than the single initial point The existing but small dispersion of the model prediction due to variation in the initial condition as demonstrated by the panels in Figure is encouraging It appears that the sensitivity or our model to the initial condition is not a significant concern regarding the ability of the model to reproduce actual behavior Figure Plot of the size of the tree with age at the second stand of the first site when some error is added to the initial conditions On every plot the error on r ranges between and while the error on h depends on the plot Three groups of initial conditions are represented no error on h error on h error on h Error on h ranges between and with a increment Same as the previous but in addition allometric relationship of the stand is assumed unknown Finally mortality is not addressed by the model although the model does produce cessation of growth under stressful circumstances Therefore tree mortality due to critical events g disturbance pathogens etc other than a limit on growth due to the external conditions can create discontinuities in the data which are not captured by the model Although the continual use of the trees with largest DBHs tends to average this discontinuity the probability that a large change in those trees occurs in year is this might have created another limit to the accuracy For instance we note that we have observed in the measurements i e after years the death of several of the trees with the largest DBHs which seems to have caused a decline of the average height of the living trees with the largest DBHs as taller trees were replaced by smaller trees in this group which is a result of mortality dynamics Holzwarth et al If we wanted to address further this question especially if we wanted to simulate many individual trees that interact together in a forest we could multiply the height h by a random process M t that would be equal to when the tree is alive and when the tree is dead Then the probability of transition between a living tree and a dead tree could be derived using experimental measurements and even be a function of the size of the tree So far though this doesn t seem to be needed in the present application So far the only things we assumed to be known for predicting the height are the external variables e temperature water potential PAR and CO the species of the tree and the allometric relationships for each stand No other knowledge about the trees was used to perform the predictions Measurements in themselves were used to compare our predictions with reality We chose to predict height as there is usually a relatively small error of measurement in height compared to other variables It should be noted that the same procedure is possible taking instead the stem volume as the quantity to predict However the results would be less precise because they will be susceptible to cumulative measurement errors of the radius and the stem height among other reasons but they would still be accurate highest error is around after and are presented in Figure As in Figure we find again between and years that the effect of thinning reduces the precision and explains the apparently strange experimental values Also we chose to predict height instead of radius or diameter as the measurements performed on the radius were the DBH which might be different from the equivalent cylindrical diameter especially for the trees with the largest DBH and this would have added an artificial error of measurement Figure Plot of the stem volume with age at the first site Continuous curves are computed with the model and start when the tree density is lower than tree ha while circles correspond to experimental measurements Panel represents the partial fit on the reference stand Panels and represent the results of the prediction with the parameters obtained by partial fitting Notable behavior The results of this model are very encouraging and are not limited to predicting the height of dominant trees but show notable qualitative behaviors in other respects Firstly it is known that forest stand growth dynamics have significantly changed since as shown in Pretzsch et al and many experiments have been conducted to measure the impact of climate and CO change on forests Climate and CO change also shows an impact on this individual tree model as the model depends on external conditions such as temperature and soil moisture as well as CO concentration For instance using the model with a constant CO concentration rather than the actual CO concentrations gives biased results and a slower growth of trees This seems coherent with both the idea that atmospheric CO had an impact on forest stand growth and that present forest stands are growing more rapidly than comparable stands before Figure Comparison of simulations with and without increasing atmospheric CO Also if we consider a small tree in a forest shaded by the canopy above it would receive only a small amount of light Therefore the model would predict a very limited maximum height and the tree would remain near this height with very small growth until a big tree nearby falls Then the light received would be higher and enough for the tree to grow taller very quickly If the tree were very close to the dead big tree then the aperture is large enough and the tree would reach the canopy If not and if the tree is still significantly partially shaded compared to the rest of the trees then its limit height would be lower than the forest height and it would reduce its growth progressively until it were close to this height This behavior would seem to be qualitatively in accordance with reality Nagel et al but due to a lack of data we have not been able test this quantitatively Finally we have examined the response of our model to a wide range of maximal carbon assimilation parameter values A max in order to investigate the conditions under which growth dominates Under the reference simulation the growth of the tree was when young but switched to being when it reached y old simulation is equivalent to that presented in Figure with A max obtained after a partial fit on the first stand from the value in Table At low values of A max e approximately of the reference the tree remained to maturity whereas at high values it was for most of its life Figure Effect of maximal carbon assimilation A max and time on simulated tree height Also shown is the limiting process for growth source or sink A max is normalized to at its value in Table To examine further the idea of the importance of considering the sink limit in this model we performed a similar simulation but we switched off the sink limit letting photosynthesis being the only limiting factor We then computed the difference of the two simulations This difference is shown in Figure As we can see for regions where A max is large the difference in tree heights between the two simulations can reach around m after several years Figure Difference in height growth with Figure when growth is switched off Discussion Our aim in developing this model has been to provide a means of representing realistic tree growth and forest vegetation dynamics at the global scale To simulate individual tree competition our preferred method is to use a gap model of succession Our global HYBRID and White computes photosynthesis and allocates photosynthate to leaves stems and roots without consideration of sink limitations All other DGVMs do something similar et al usually at the level e they do not consider individuals at The motivation of the new model described here is to explore a framework for introducing in DGVMs growth We have suggested as simple a scheme as possible to avoid reaching the point where we can no longer simulate dynamics at the global scale due to limited computing resources The approach to modeling photosynthesis in DGVMs is similar to ours in that the whole canopy is typically simulated as one leaf and so it seems appropriate to simulate the meristems with a similar approach We have chosen two meristem and lateral in order to simulate the essential properties of height and diameter growth Our new model is a major advance over current global models and we expect that it could have significant consequences for our understanding of the historical and future global terrestrial carbon sink Our model starts from physiological considerations about trees and several hypotheses to derive differential equations that are solved over time to obtain the growth of a tree and predict its size Although the model is fairly simple and far from taking every possible parameter of the tree into account it seems to obtain very good results and predictions which agree closely with observations from different stands of trees with different environmental conditions Interestingly our approach gives rise to two limiting tree heights h the limit height above which photosynthesis cannot occur and h the height above which growth is limited by the capacity of the meristematic regions themselves to grow at low water potential These two heights represent different processes h includes the factors that limit photosynthesis such as minimal turgor potential and possible xylem cavitation e source whereas h takes into account intrinsic meristem factors such as the physiological limits of cell division and growth limits such as cell wall extension when the water potential is too low e sink While h more generally source is often considered as the only limiting height to explain the maximal height of trees g Koch et al under some external conditions of light and temperature it could be that h e sink becomes limiting Friend Although in this model water potential is still the critical factor which limits the height of trees the amount of light received and the temperature during the growth period also play roles that could produce one or other limit and influence its value Hence our approach could give a new and more complete understanding of the limits of tree height and growth more generally through a balanced consideration of both source and sink limitations Concerning the derivation of the results we could have avoided assuming known allometric relationships for each stand and tried to estimate them as described in Section mechanism of the tree Another way to estimate the allometric relationship on the second and third stand could be to estimate it close to the allometric relathionship of the first stand used for partial fitting In that case we would still get good results with R around The small difference of accuracy between this case and the previous one is mainly due to the model becoming more sensitive to measurement error when we estimate the allometric relationship and also to the estimated allometric relationship being a constant as explained in Section whereas the allometric relationship in reality changes with changes in tree density and therefore time Lastly our model for is probably too simple as we also explained in Section Nevertheless we can note that the accuracy of the results is still very good considering that we try here to predict the heights of three stands without knowing anything but the species the CO concentration the temperature the soil moisture the PAR the number of trees per ha and the initial tree dimensions This last point also underscores an additional motivation to build such a relatively simple model collecting data about the external variables can be difficult Therefore data can be limiting and in order to be practical the model should stay as simple as it can relative to the required data provided that it can still give accurate results As a first dynamic model for an individual tree using such considerations about control mechanism and the maximal limited rate of growth improvements could probably be made by introducing additional parameters especially taking the roots into account explicitly and improving the function of the red ratio Nevertheless the model already gives very good results while being relatively simple allowing its wider use such as through allowing many trees to interact with each other via shading water potential etc and obtaining a model for the whole forest So far the partial fitting of the parameters within bounds of takes less than s on a computer and computing height over y less than s which suggests that its use as a growth simulator within a forest model could be achieved with today s computer resources Our model makes the interesting prediction that under standard conditions parameterization trees shift from being to as they mature This behavior is consistent with field and experimental evidence for a lack of stem growth response to elevated CO in mature trees despite increased photosynthesis g van der Sleen et al whereas young fast growing trees show significant responses g Norby et al In our model the cause of the change in growth limitation as trees grow appears to be a combination of the effect of the limiting height for meristem activity h and the dependency of the balance of photosynthesis and respiration on height The relative simplicity of the model and its extremely encouraging results should stimulate further use of similar differential models in the future Starting from physiological considerations to derive differential equations and an individual tree model as a cornerstone for simulating a whole forest may considerably improve our understanding of forest behavior including but not limited to the prediction of overall responses of forests to increasing CO concentrations in order to address the future terrestrial carbon sink A number of other models have the potential to address the issues considered in this paper For example the FSPM et al contains a number of features that make it applicable to the debate including carbohydrate storage dynamics product inhibition of photosynthesis a framework for sugar partitioning a sink growth control from available carbon a direct effect of water supply and an intrinsic size limit The pipe model constraint is used making overall growth a strong function of leaf growth which itself is determined by carbon supply However it is not clear the extent to which this model would predict either or under different environmental conditions and or timescales This would be a very interesting exercise FSPMs are also relevant to the calculation of canopy red far red ratios as they explicitly treat light interception throughout the canopy In fact some herbaceous crop models already compute the canopy red far red ratio distribution and its influence on morphogenesis g Chelle et al Such approaches could be simplified for implementing dynamic red far red ratio responses in our model To conclude we have proposed a differential model for modeling tree growth over time under external conditions such as temperature soil moisture and CO concentration This model takes into account not only photosynthesis and the carbon balance but also meristem behavior and cellular growth limits We established a procedure to parametrize the model with measurable quantities and reference measurements This model seems not only to fit data very well but also to give accurate predictions for tree height and

is composed of numerous cell types neurons have received the vast majority of attention in the attempt to understand how this organ functions Neurons are indeed fundamental but in order for them to function correctly they rely on the surrounding cells These different cell types which include glia epithelial cells pericytes and endothelia supply essential substances to neurons in addition to protecting them from dangerous substances and situations Moreover it is now clear that cells can also actively participate in determining neuronal signaling outcomes Due to the increasing problem of obesity in industrialized countries investigation of the central control of energy balance has greatly increased in attempts to identify new therapeutic targets This has led to interesting advances in our understanding of how appetite and systemic metabolism are modulated by cells For example not only are nutrients and hormones transported into the brain by cells but these cells can also metabolize these metabolic factors thus modifying the signals reaching the neurons The hypothalamus is the main integrating center of incoming metabolic and hormonal signals and interprets this information in order to control appetite and systemic metabolism Hence the factors transported and released from surrounding cells will undoubtedly influence metabolic homeostasis This review focuses on what is known to date regarding the involvement of different cell types in the transport and metabolism of nutrients and hormones in the hypothalamus The possible involvement of cells in particular glial cells in physiopathological outcomes of poor dietary habits and excess weight gain are also discussed hypothalamus metabolism energy homeostasis glia inflammation Ministerio de Ciencia e Ministerio de Sanidad Servicios Sociales e Igualdad CIBEROBN CIBERFES Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte Introduction Our understanding of the neuronal circuits controlling metabolism has advanced in recent years and progress has been made in the development of potential treatments for obesity particularly in specific monogenic forms of obesity However the brain is not composed of neurons other cell types actually outnumber these electrically excitable nerve cells and participate in and or modulate all neuronal functions In the hypothalamus this includes the participation of cells in the modulation of neuronal circuits controlling appetite and metabolism cells in the central nervous system including glia epithelial cells pericytes and endothelia perform a wide spectrum of functions throughout the brain Many of these functions are common in each brain area although the specific outcomes are at least in part dependent on the neuronal circuits that are affected by their actions Moreover within each class of cell type there are generalized subclassifications that although quite incomplete indicate diverse functional states There are also specialized cell types found only in specific areas of the brain One important example that will be discussed in greater detail is tanycytes specialized glial cells found lining the third ventricle and in close proximity to the neuroendocrine hypothalamus The fact that there is wide heterogeneity within each cell type has become increasingly however we currently do not have the tools available to sufficiently distinguish between these subpopulations and this has clearly hindered advances in this field With the explosion in the prevalence of obesity that has occurred almost worldwide investigation in the area of metabolic control has become a priority This has led to an increase in our understanding of how cell types participate in the neuroendocrine control of appetite and energy expenditure as well as in the response to increased weight gain and the development of secondary complications Here we have briefly outlined the different types of brain cells and some of their functions both in general and those that are specific to the hypothalamus and metabolic circuits Classification of Cells in the Brain Astroglial Cells Astrocytes were the first class of glial cells to be described and they are also the most studied One example of this is that a search of the word in the PubMed Central database obtains approximately typing or receives less than returns in either case Astroglia are also the most abundant cell type in the CNS and were first thought to only constitute the physical and metabolic support for neuronal function We now know that they are much more than just Astrocytes do indeed transport nutrients and metabolic factors across the barrier and release them to the extracellular fluid where they can be used by neurons and other glial cells However it is now clear that this supply of energy substrates to other cell types is regulated with astrocytes responding to metabolic changes in order to maintain brain homeostasis Astrocytes are also the only glial cells known to store energy through glycogenesis In the synaptic cleft they reuptake neurotransmitters and also can release gliotransmitters forming part of what is called the At the level of the BBB astrocytes are involved in the formation and maintenance of some of the barrier properties and can regulate vasodilatation thus controlling the flow of substances Figure Schematic representation of the barrier Astrocytic endfeet surround the microvessels and take up the nutrients and metabolic factors coming from the bloodstream Endothelial cells at this level express specific receptors and transporters and restrict the passage of small molecules to the brain due to the tight junctions between them Depending on the metabolic state nutrients and factors are processed by astrocytes to control their access to neurons and maintain brain homeostasis Astrocytes are connected by gap junctions in their plasma membranes which enable direct transport of small molecules between cells Initially it was thought that these channels allowed passive diffusion of however the transport through gap junctions is tightly regulated One important function of these gap junctions is the rapid transmission of calcium waves within the glial network resulting in a form of signal transmission When employing classical labeling methods astrocytes appear to have a morphology although two different forms protoplasmic and fibrous can be distinguished The first are mainly found close to synapses and blood vessels whereas the latter are frequently found within the white matter The morphology of these glial cells also changes in respect to their functional or activational state The fact that astrocytes differentially express certain proteins g receptors enzymes channels etc depending on the brain area and the physiological or pathophysiological conditions to which they are subjected raises questions regarding the current definition and classification of astroglial cells Growing evidence indicates that astrocytes are vastly heterogeneous For example Matthias and colleagues reported that within the hippocampus subsets of GFAP expressing cells expressed either glutamate transporters or glutamate receptors Moreover astrocytes throughout the brain differentially express connexins and GABA and glutamate receptors and different astrocyte populations are reported to differentially support developmental functions and synapse formation Thus our understanding of the functions of astrocytes is advancing but much is yet to be learned Indeed we are only now beginning to have the tools to understand the grand diversity of these glial cells Microglia Microglial cells constitute the bulk of the immune system in the brain There have been different systems suggested for the classification of microglia with most engaging morphological features The most general classification includes an amoeboid form characteristic of early development and a ramified form or microglia and reactive microglia The phenotype of reactive microglia is defined by changes in morphology to short and thick projections and the release of factors like cytokines nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species This or change in phenotype can occur in response to brain damage toxic substances or injury due to harmful conditions like obesity or a high fat diet and when this state is sustained it can lead to a pathological chronic state of reactive microgliosis However the division that separates resting and reactive microglia has become more diffuse as we learn more about these cells One of the main functions of microglia is to the CNS by phagocytosis of cellular debris foreign matter and other wastes In this manner they participate in development and synaptic plasticity They can also release gliotransmitters and metabolic factors contributing to maintain brain homeostasis Importantly as part of the immune system microglial cells respond to injury and harmful factors including fatty acids by releasing cytokines and to infection by presenting antigens to Oligodendrocytes Oligodendrocyte projections wrap neuronal axons forming the myelin sheaths in the CNS To date no direct link between these cells and systemic metabolic function has been verified although some studies connecting metabolic signals with changes in myelination or oligodendrocyte survival suggest at least an indirect relationship with metabolism However it has been recently shown that oligodendrocyte precursors in the median eminence are important for the function of leptin neurons whose dendritic processes they contact Tanycytes These specialized glial cells lining the ventral and ventrolateral part of the third ventricle are proving to be very interesting as we know more about them From dorsal to ventral they are classified as subtypes and They are polarized cells on the they express numerous receptors and transporters in their membrane and can be ciliated and on the opposite side they present a long process that projects into the hypothalamic parenchyma or the median eminence The tanycytes can be found close to the median eminence a subhypothalamic circumventricular organ Capillaries on the median eminence are fenestrated making the BBB permeable to many substances The long processes of project into these fenestrated vessels forming a barrier The tight junctions between them in addition to the specific transporters that they express allow them to control the entry of many substances into the hypothalamus They can also regulate the permeability of this barrier at this level of the brain by the release of vascular endothelial growth in response to metabolic changes and possibly by other mechanisms Although astrocytes are the major cells expressing gap junctions tanycytes also express these structures and can also produce calcium wave signaling Tanycytes also possess stem cell properties and participate in glutamate recycling nutrient sensing and the conversion of thyroid hormones Figure Schematic representation of tanycytes lining the third ventricle Microvessels of the median eminence are fenestrated so they allow water ions and small molecules to freely enter the brain present tight junctions between them forming a barrier They take up nutrients and factors from the microvessels and control their access to the cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the brain This is probably the main route for some hormones and nutrients to the hypothalamus Also tanycytes are communicated through gap junctions so some molecules can be transported to lateral and and gain access to the arcuate nucleus and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus Pericytes Pericytes are contractile cells surrounding the blood vessels In addition to their ability to modify blood flow due to their contractibility brain pericytes have multiple roles in the development and maintenance of the BBB including functions and characteristics angiogenic properties and a role in neuroinflammation Indeed in response to brain injury there is evidence that pericytes change to a phenotype migrate to the brain parenchyma and are involved in scar formation antigen presentation and the release of inflammatory factors Pericytes are also reported to be multipotential stem cells in the CNS However the identity of these stem cells is still a subject of controversy due to the lack of reliable pericyte markers Endothelial Cells Endothelial cells along with pericytes form the walls of the microvessels taking part in the transport of metabolites through the BBB The particularities of BBB endothelial cells described below allow for a strict control of the passage of substances from the blood into the CNS Epithelial Cells Ependymocytes In the CNS epithelial cells can be found in the choroid plexus and lining the ventricles They secrete the cerebrospinal fluid that fills the ventricles and factors involved in neurogenesis and brain development Epithelial cells of the CNS also express transporters for glucose amino acids and other molecules as well as receptors for hormones such as sex steroids and leptin Moreover they form a type of BCSFB due to the tight junctions between them Ependymal cells are epithelial cells lining the ventricles Their polarized organization and beating of numerous cilia are important for the movement of CSF They also possess precursor properties and together with tanycytes form the hypothalamic neurogenic niche Functions of Cells Transport of Metabolic Signals into and within the Hypothalamus The transport of nutrients and other metabolic signals is one of the best studied functions of cells in the nervous system At the physiological level nutrients from the diet hormones and other substances are delivered to all tissues through the bloodstream However due to its exceptional importance and vulnerability the CNS protects its homeostasis by carefully controlling what can and cannot enter from the circulation This function is carried out by the BBB which is formed by specialized glia pericytes and endothelial cells expressing transporters receptors and sensors that allow them to select the information and nutrients accessing the nervous tissue As nutrients and metabolic signals are also found in the CSF there is a BCSFB formed by ependymal cells and tanycytes in the third ventricle The distribution of tight junction proteins between tanycytes at this level is important in determining the permeability of the barrier being lower at the median eminence where there are fenestrated capillaries and higher next to the arcuate nucleus The first checkpoint for any substance to cross the BBB into the CNS is the endothelial cell the bricks forming the capillary walls Endothelial cells in the BBB are phenotypically different from those of peripheral vessels and restrict the access of substances to the extracellular fluid of the CNS To achieve this these endothelial cells have tight junctions between them reduced endocytosis no fenestrations and specific transporters and receptors in addition to a large number of mitochondria Thus brain capillary endothelial cells broadly determine the barrier permeability Surrounding these capillaries are the astrocytic endfeet along with pericytes and microglia These other cells also participate in the regulation of nutrient and hormone entry and thus metabolic signaling from the periphery Astrocytes and other cells can detect changes in the concentrations of specific nutrients and the presence of other signals and react consequently to maintain brain homeostasis as described below Glucose Glucose the main energy source of the CNS enters the brain from the bloodstream crossing the BBB through specific transporters As normal brain function depends on its glucose supply this step is highly regulated That is the transport of glucose across the BBB adapts in response to cerebral energy demand in order to maintain glucose homeostasis in the brain The facilitative glucose transporter is largely responsible for glucose transport across the BBB This protein is expressed in cells throughout the CNS especially in astrocytes and endothelial cells of the BBB as well as in tanycytes along the BCSFB However in endothelial cells is highly glycosylated having a higher molecular weight than the isoform expressed in astrocytes and other glial cells As indicated in a recent review some authors suggest different functional characteristics between the two forms of although there is no consensus on this subject Changes in glucose concentration are rapidly detected in the hypothalamus which adapts to such variations and emits a response to maintain glucose homeostasis not only in the brain but also systemically as neurons in the hypothalamus send signals to the autonomous nervous system reaching peripheral organs such as the pancreas or the liver There is more than one mechanism for central glucose sensing and different cell types are involved in this essential task Two populations of neurons have been identified and neurons and GI and glial cells also participate in these important mechanisms Astrocyte endfeet express which in addition to its transport functions participates in glucose sensing This GLUT is highly expressed in tanycytes along the BCSFB with these specialized glial cells also participating in processes In addition to expressing astrocytes and tanycytes express sodium glucose transporter glucokinase and K ATP channels proteins that are all known to be involved in mechanisms Indeed the classical mechanism for glucose sensing in pancreatic requires glucose uptake through in rodents or in humans GCK and activation of K channels This system shares some similarities with pathways in astrocytes and tanycytes One proposed model for glucose sensing in tanycytes involves glucose entering the cell through and phosphorylation by GCK Subsequently undergoes glycolysis producing pyruvate and through the action of lactate dehydrogenase lactate Lactate is transported to the extracellular space by monocarboxylate transporter or and then taken up by neurons through Depending on the kind of neuron GE or GI an excitatory or inhibitory signal will be produced in the hypothalamus and sent to other brain areas and the autonomic nervous system Tanycytes can also respond rapidly to glucose and other inputs by producing calcium waves a process requiring ATP release and autocrine signaling through purinergic receptors The precise mechanisms involved in this tanycytic response are not yet fully elucidated but it constitutes a possible model for interaction Glucose sensing in astrocytes involves a similar process Indeed according to the lactate hypothesis proposed by Pellerin and Magistretti over two decades ago lactate from glucose or glycogen metabolism released by astrocytes is not only used by neurons as an energy source but can also signal energy availability to neurons Glucose transport into astrocytes is facilitated by or occurs through gap junctions in a passive manner This glucose can be metabolized or stored as glycogen However it is still debated as to whether astrocytes secrete only lactate or also glucose to the extracellular fluid to act on neurons and to be used as fuel Moreover astrocytes and tanycytes can respond to an increase in glucose or to other signals e some by secreting endozepines anorexigenic peptides that act on hypothalamic neurons to maintain energy homeostasis and that also participate in unsaturated fatty acid metabolism in astrocytes The precise mechanisms of glucose transport and sensing in the hypothalamus are yet to be fully elucidated For example SGLT an active sodium is reported to be involved in glucose sensing in the ventromedial nucleus of the rodent hypothalamus although it is not clear whether this sensing occurs in glucose responsive neurons or in astrocytes By using genetically engineered mouse models and collaborators recently demonstrated that insulin signaling in astrocytes plays a role in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis Specific ablation of the insulin receptor in astrocytes was shown to impair their uptake of glucose and the ability to correctly respond to changes in glycemia Other studies suggest a role of leptin in increasing or ghrelin in reducing glucose uptake by astrocytes which might also affect glucose sensing It thus appears that the transport of glucose by astrocytes is highly regulated by diverse nutrient and hormonal signals Ketone Bodies Monocarboxylates are molecules with one carboxylate some examples with metabolic functions include not only lactate but also pyruvate and ketones all of which can be used by neurons as an alternative energy source in addition to acting as metabolic signals The brain expresses and with being found in endothelial and ependymal cells as well as in astrocyte endfeet at the BBB is expressed in endothelial cells but not in astrocytes whereas appears to be specific for astrocytes Ketone bodies and other monocarboxylates from the bloodstream cross the BBB through specific MCTs present in both the luminal and abluminal sides of the endothelial cells Astrocyte endfeet not only takes up monocarboxylates through but these glial cells are also able to synthesize ketone bodies from fatty acid and secrete them as an energy source for neurons and other glial cells Tanycytes have also been suggested to transport lactate through in a photoperiodic model of Siberian hamster These authors found that and the glutamate transporter GLAST were decreased during a short photoperiod which could indicate a change in seasonal neurotransporter supply In the rat brain tanycytes were shown to express functional and in an anatomically specific manner suggesting that these glial cells may also participate in lactate transport to neurons Regulation of the transport and production of ketone bodies in the brain is important in metabolic control as hypothalamic sensing of these monocarboxylates also participates in the regulation of food intake Indeed after the initial hyperphagia there is a reduction in food intake that is reported to be mediated at least in part by ketone body signaling to hypothalamic neurons These ketone bodies are synthesized by hypothalamic astrocytes as products of fatty acid metabolism Lipids Lipid sensing in the hypothalamus is necessary for the correct regulation of energy balance There are lipid sensing neurons that are excited or inhibited by fatty acids depending on the type of neuron and also the metabolic state i e fasting versus overfeeding Although the role of glial cells in this process is not fully understood astrocytes are the primary lipid metabolizers in the CNS They also express proteins related to lipid sensing such as transporter and peroxisome receptor gamma an important nuclear receptor that regulates transcription of numerous genes including some involved in lipid metabolism In addition astrocytic production of ketone bodies from fatty acids and their release to neurons could be one way by which an excess of fatty acids is signaled to metabolic neuronal circuits Recent evidence suggests an increase in fatty acid in hypothalamic astrocytes from obese mice fed a HFD as well as a role for tanycytes in restricting the passage of saturated fatty acids into the hypothalamus Although the brain produces lipids it also has mechanisms to transport them from the bloodstream but how they go through the BBB is not yet fully understood Short and medium chain fatty acids appear to enter the CNS by simple diffusion through the plasma membrane In contrast long chain fatty acids need transporters to cross the BBB with several fatty acid transport proteins and fatty acid binding proteins having been identified In vitro studies indicate that and are the major isoforms expressed in microvessel endothelial cells and the gray matter of the human brain When the fatty acid translocase is in mice the uptake of monounsaturated fatty acids is significantly decreased with no effect on polyunsaturated fatty acid uptake In the CNS is expressed in endothelial cells microglial cells astrocytes and in ventromedial hypothalamic neurons Although it is not the most highly expressed FATP studies indicate that is responsible for fatty acid sensing in the hypothalamus and is thus important for the control of energy homeostasis In addition to the passage of free fatty acids through the BBB lipids can also enter or exit the CNS as lipoproteins This process is mediated by apolipoprotein E interacting with lipoprotein receptors In the CNS ApoE is expressed in astrocytes and tanycytes and its levels are upregulated by both leptin and TH with this process being involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance Hormone Transport and Signaling Leptin Leptin is an anorexigenic hormone that exerts part of its effects by inhibiting orexigenic neurons and activating anorexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus It also has a role in the regulation of systemic lipid and glucose metabolism The leptin receptor which has six isoforms is highly expressed in brain endothelial cells astrocytes and tanycytes and endothelial and astroglial cells have been studied in attempt to unravel the mechanisms of leptin transport into the brain However and colleagues have recently reported that in a human in vitro BBB model interaction is not necessary for the transport of this hormone across the BBB They propose that lipoprotein expressed in endothelial cells at the BBB is responsible for the passage of leptin across the BBB Increasing evidence points to the BCSFB as the main pathway for entry of leptin into at least the hypothalamus The median eminence a circumventricular organ close to the third ventricle is the first site in the brain reached by leptin After an intraperitoneal leptin injection there is a h lag between the activation of leptin signaling pathways in the ventral and dorsal nuclei of the hypothalamus This disappears when leptin is administered intracerebroventricularly instead of intraperitoneally suggesting that leptin transport from blood to the CSF is an important step in the action of this hormone in the brain and that it involves a delay in circulating changes reaching central target sites Moreover this process appears to be a finely regulated step in the control of energy balance as tanycytes act as for the passage of leptin into the mediobasal hypothalamus Evidence suggests that leptin is first taken up by tanycyte processes in contact with the fenestrated capillaries at the median eminence and that this uptake requires the activation of ObRb and the internalization of leptin by vesicles According to research carried out by Vincent Prevot and his team this process involves signal transducer and activator of transcription protein kinase B Akt and extracellular signal regulated kinase phosphorylation but is janus independent Leptin is then transported toward the tanycyte cell body and finally released to the CSF and hypothalamic parenchyma employing an pathway By using phosphorylation as an indicator of leptin signaling Balland and collaborators reported that neutralization of leptin in the CSF impairs leptin signaling in mediobasal hypothalamic neurons supporting the idea of the gateway for leptin entry into the brain Taking into account the above mentioned studies it appears that both endothelial cells and tanycytes contribute to the transport of leptin through the BBB and between different brain regions In contrast there is no clear evidence of the involvement of astrocytes in leptin transport but a number of studies demonstrate that leptin signaling in astrocytes is important for energy homeostasis Leptin transport into the brain is modulated by conditions including obesity and fasting as well as metabolic factors Obesity associated to HFD intake is reported to induce central leptin resistance There are two main mechanisms or levels of leptin resistance suggested to occur impairment of leptin transport into the brain and reduction in the central response to leptin Mice exposed long term to a HFD develop leptin resistance only when high levels of plasma leptin are reached This suggests that hyperleptinemia is at least one of the causes of leptin resistance In addition hypothalamic inflammation associated with obesity could contribute to leptin resistance by altering the cellular networks and molecular pathways that control energy homeostasis Nevertheless recent studies suggest that leptin resistance does not imply a loss of responsiveness to endogenous leptin but rather that there is a threshold above which exogenous leptin barely increases the response to leptin Glucose and insulin are reported to increase the transport of leptin across the BBB while an increase in circulating triglycerides could impair leptin transport across the BBB The latter suggests a possible mechanism for the reported reduction in leptin transport into the brain during fasting Ghrelin Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced and secreted in the stomach It has similar targets as leptin in the CNS and also plays an important but opposite role in energy balance There are two forms of ghrelin acylated and unacylated depending on the acylation with octanoic or decanoic acid This modification occurs mainly in the stomach but there is evidence that it can also take place in target tissues The acylated form of ghrelin exerts the majority of the metabolic effects of this hormone in the CNS and it binds more efficiently to the ghrelin receptor than the unacylated form This receptor also called the growth hormone secretagogue receptor is widely expressed in the hypothalamus The mechanism underlying the passage of ghrelin across the BBB is not yet fully understood but recent studies indicate that ghrelin possibly uses a similar route as leptin into the brain i e through tanycytes in contact with the median eminence Other studies indicate that this process is carried out by saturable transporters at least for the acylated form whereas transport of ghrelin is not saturable Entry of acylated ghrelin into the CNS is increased by serum triglycerides and fasting and is decreased in obese mice in contrast with leptin transport obesity is reported to impair the hypothalamic response to peripherally or centrally administered ghrelin The role of unacylated ghrelin on metabolism is largely unknown but an increasing number of studies reveal that ghrelin has similar and opposite functions as the acylated form Insulin Insulin is a pancreatic hormone directly involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis Within the brain it acts to increase energy expenditure and reduce food intake and energy storage Insulin binds to its receptor in the plasma membranes of endothelial cells at the BBB and is internalized following a saturable pathway Recent studies have shown that IRs in astrocytes are involved in the entry of this hormone into the CNS Also as mentioned above insulin signaling in astrocytes is necessary for the regulation of systemic glucose levels Insulin transport into the brain is enhanced by satiation hormones like cholecystokinin Although estradiol is known to impair actions in the brain its effects appear to be unrelated to insulin transport Some studies show that leptin increases insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus at the molecular level while others have found that leptin impairs insulin signaling in the brain This discrepancy could be a matter of the experimental model employed but further research is needed to understand the relationship between the effects of leptin and insulin at the level of the CNS Leptin shares some signaling pathways with insulin but the effects of these two hormones are not entirely parallel as they exert opposite effects in some hypothalamic neurons Saturated fatty acids induce insulin resistance in the hypothalamus as has been previously described in peripheral tissues Sex Steroids As hydrophobic molecules estrogens androgens and progesterone can enter the brain by simple diffusion Moreover steroids are synthesized in the brain These neurosteroids are produced in the CNS either from cholesterol or from peripherally synthesized steroid precursors like pregnenolone deoxycorticosterone and testosterone The enzymes necessary for this synthesis are found in cells including astrocytes tanycytes ependymal cells and oligodendrocytes and in some neurons As steroid hormones are known to regulate neurosteroid metabolism in glial cells and also the expression levels of steroid receptors in the hypothalamus neurosteroids could have paracrine autocrine functions within the brain Steroids and neurosteroids exert neuroprotective effects in the brain following brain injury neurological disease or inflammation The expression of aromatase the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of testosterone into estradiol is stimulated in reactive astrocytes after brain injury as a neuroprotective measure Both microglial cells and astrocytes play an important role in the neuroprotective functions of steroids as sex steroids diminish microglia reactivity and astrocyte production of proinflammatory molecules Sex steroids but specially estrogens modulate energy homeostasis at the hypothalamic level decreasing food intake increasing energy expenditure and modulating the sensitivity to other metabolic hormones Their effect differs depending on the neuronal population but with an overall anorectic effect although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood While nuclear estrogen receptors are involved especially ER evidence indicates that estrogen responsive membrane receptors can also regulate these effects The apparently contradictory results in the literature regarding the mechanism of action of estrogens on metabolism indicate a complex system for function in energy homeostasis where the different ERs could be acting in combination Moreover the mechanisms of action used by estrogens in metabolic control could be sexually dimorphic The involvement of neurosteroids in energy homeostasis remains unknown Thyroid Hormones The role of TH in increasing the metabolic rate has been known for more than a century The involvement of these hormones in the control of energy homeostasis at the central level is a more recent discovery They promote lipogenesis at the level of the hypothalamus which eventually leads to brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and blockage of TH signaling in the hypothalamus reverts this process leading to weight gain without an increase in feeding Clinical studies and animal models with a pathological excess of TH synthesis and secretion have shed light on TH action in the hypothalamus and control of energy balance Most hyperthyroid patients have an increased appetite and food intake and decreased body weight Moreover these same symptoms that are observed in animal models of hyperthyroidism are associated with the upregulation of orexigenic neuropeptides AgRP and NPY and downregulation of anorexigenic neuropeptides derived from POMC in the arcuate nucleus There is evidence that TH are involved in brain inflammation promoting survival and processes growth in microglial cells and also in astrocytes TH are also involved in systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensing The thyroid gland produces and secretes mainly l or thyroxine which is generally transformed into l through deiodination at the level of peripheral tissues Thus deiodinase enzyme expression in peripheral tissues is important for the control of TH actions as they catalyze the transformation of into and of both hormones into reverse and l respectively These two last forms are usually considered inactive although in the last few years new roles have been proposed for them and other TH Thyroid hormones enter the hypothalamus mainly through and organic anion transporting in rodents These transporters are expressed in endothelial cells of the BBB and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus besides neurons and glial cells of the hypothalamus Tanycytes act as gatekeepers for TH at the BBB These cells express the enzyme deiodinase II catalyzing the formation of hormone from the prohormone Tanycytes uptake from the capillaries and release to the extracellular space in the hypothalamus where this hormone can exert its central actions Modulation of deiodinase expression is a key point in TH homeostasis For example DII expression in tanycytes is promoted in fasting conditions tanycytes are in direct contact with AgRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus Upregulation of DII results in an increased production of which activates AgRP NPY neurons and therefore feeding behavior Tanycytes also express deiodinase III which deiodinates into reverse which is biologically inactive and into TH is important in the adaptation to different photoperiods in seasonal animals were for example there is a decrease in food intake and body weight during short photoperiods The study of hypothalamic metabolism of TH during photoperiodic changes in seasonal mammals has shown that the there is an upregulation of DII during periods of long days which would increase the levels of In Siberian hamsters an upregulation of DIII in tanycytes has been shown to occur during short photoperiods lowering active levels The retinoic acid pathway in tanycytes appears to be similarly regulated by photoperiodicity and also leads to modifications in energy expenditure Thyroid hormone signaling usually occurs through nuclear thyroid receptors and that function as transcription factors modulating gene expression TH can also exert rapid actions through receptors This signaling pathway could mediate TH effects on vasodilatation and has been shown to be involved in neuronal excitability in the hippocampus Centrally THs control their own homeostasis in various ways with cells having an important role i e regulation of deiodinase expression and inactivation of thyroid releasing hormone Other hormones involved in metabolic control can enhance the secretion synthesis or sensing of TH including leptin and sex steroids Metabolism of Nutrients Glucose Perivascular astrocytes glucose that then undergoes glycolysis or glycogenesis Lactate produced from glucose or glycogen metabolism in these cells is released to the extracellular space and enters neurons to be used as energy constituting their primary energy source as suggested by some studies However the question about the identity of the main energy source for or still debated Tanycytes can metabolize and sense glucose in a similar manner Glucose storage as glycogen in astrocytes provides a way to guarantee energy release to neurons when it is needed i e when faced with a raise in neuronal activity by production of lactate from glycogenolysis Several factors can regulate glycogen production and utilization in astrocytes with insulin growth factor and leptin increasing their production of glycogen More recently ghrelin has been reported to possibly promote glycogenolysis in hypothalamic neurons Lipids and Ketone Bodies It has been suggested that some fatty acids like erucic acid suffer metabolic changes as they cross the BBB whereas others do not Studies indicate that lipoproteins are hydrolyzed as they cross the BBB by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase associated to the membrane of endothelial cells In the absence of glucose and when glycogen stores are exhausted such as in fasting conditions astrocytes increase their uptake and utilization of fatty acids which enter the mitochondria through carnitine to undergo In the mitochondria the enzymes synthase and lyase transform fatty acids into a ketone body Ketone bodies produced from this metabolic pathway are used by astrocytes themselves for fuel or secreted to be used by neurons and other glial cells Neurogenesis Glial cells were first reported to participate in neurogenesis during development but it later became apparent that they are also involved in this process in adulthood In the developing hypothalamus of the rat the birth of metabolically important neurons occurs between embryonic days and Environmental changes during this period including nutritional and hormonal disturbances can modulate the normal process of hypothalamic neurogenesis and have an impact on later neuroendocrine function For example HFD intake by pregnant dams stimulates the proliferation differentiation and migration of orexigenic neuronal precursors and increases the density of orexigenic neurons at the level of the paraventricular nucleus in the offspring This increase in the number and density of neurons and orexigenic neuropeptide expression leads to increased appetite body weight and propensity to develop obesity later in life The clear demonstration as well as its acceptance by the scientific community of neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamus is relatively recent and there is still much to be learned Tanycytes form part of the pool of neuroprogenitor cells in the hypothalamus and these precursors are capable of differentiating into not only neurons but also astrocytes both during development and in the adult brain These specialized glial cells form an important neurogenic niche in the vicinity of the median eminence and can proliferate and differentiate under basal conditions and when stimulated by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor or even vitamins as tanycytes have been shown to express receptors transporters and other components of the vitamin A and C pathways positive tanycytes are reported to be important neural progenitors for NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus a function that may continue even during adulthood In addition other isoforms of FGF are known to play a role in glucose homeostasis inhibition of food intake and body weight with a possible involvement of glial cells Although the generation of newborn neurons in the postnatal hypothalamus takes place at lower rates than during the embryonic period it is physiologically relevant and has been shown to be regulated by diverse factors including hormones and growth factors such as estradiol FGF and Moreover the nutritional status and dietary intake of an individual can modulate neurogenesis in hypothalamic metabolic circuits even in the adult animal The neurons composing the hypothalamic metabolic circuits experience a turnover rate such that approximately half of these cells are reported to be replaced between and weeks of age in mice obesity suppresses this remodeling at least in part due to a decrease in actively proliferating cells in the hypothalamus with caloric restriction reversing this effect Voluntary exercise is also reported to induce hypothalamic neurogenesis The effect of nutrient intake on the adult hypothalamus may be anatomically specific as diets rich in fat are reported to inhibit neurogenesis in the mediobasal hypothalamic parenchyma but to promote it in the median eminence in female mice The enhanced neurogenesis that occurs at the level of the median eminence is suggested to be involved in the restoration of neurons that are damaged as a consequence of HFD intake hence impedance of this process could amplify the derogatory effects of poor dietary habits There is tantalizing data indicating that hypothalamic neurogenesis in response to HFD differs between males and females but whether this is involved in the sexually dimorphic metabolic response to HFD and weight gain requires further investigation Astrocytes are involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation proliferation and synaptogenesis during development Microglia also actively participate in neurogenesis both during development and adulthood with most studies being performed in the hippocampus Microglia not only phagocytize cells undergoing apoptosis in proliferative zones but they also produce factors that can either inhibit or stimulate neuroprogenitor cells The between microglia and neuroprogenitor cells is an active area of investigation as this is a finely tuned process where these cells continuously interchange information However less is known regarding the role of astrocytes and microglia in neurogenesis in metabolic circuits of the adult animal Diet not only affects neurogenesis in the hypothalamus but also in other brain areas such as the hippocampus an area known to maintain active neurogenesis even in the adult In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus HFD intake impairs neurogenesis in addition to producing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation Palmitic acid a saturated fatty acid that is a major component of the majority of HFDs was shown to reduce the proliferation of the neuroprogenitor cells and the levels of neurotrophic factor indicating that diets impair neurogenesis in the hippocampus Caloric restriction and exercise increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and this has been associated with the effects of exercise Synaptogenesis Synaptic Plasticity and Synaptic Transmission Astrocytes in addition to participating in neuronal proliferation and differentiation also regulate synaptogenesis during development In the hypothalamus the neonatal and early prenatal hormonal and nutritional environments can affect the synaptic connectivity of metabolic circuits Astroglial coverage of neuronal cell surfaces has been shown to be inversely correlated with the number of synaptic inputs to their somas with this astroglial ensheathment synaptic input arrangement being physiologically relevant in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus Thus changes in astrocyte numbers or morphology in the hypothalamus might be expected to modify synaptic inputs both during development and in later life The generation and maturation of astrocytes is not fully complete until the third postnatal week in rodents so variations in the physiological levels of specific metabolic hormones or signals during early life could affect the development of these cells For example neonatal overnutrition and modifications in leptin levels or signaling affect the number and morphology of astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus in adulthood The leptin peak that takes place between postnatal days and in rodents is essential not only for neuronal outgrowth and maturation but also astrogenesis and astrocyte development The timing and magnitude of this leptin surge can be modified by nutrition as well as other conditions such as stress and is one mechanism by which these early environmental influences can have effects on metabolism Maternal dietary intake and body weight during gestation and lactation can also influence metabolic circuit formation in the offspring including the astroglial ensheathment synaptic input arrangement For example newborns from mothers fed a HFD during gestation and lactation have increased astroglial ensheathment of POMC neurons that is associated with a decrease in the resting mini inhibitory post synaptic currents of these neurons The response of these POMC neurons to changes in glucose concentrations was also shown to be modified Hence alterations in the early nutritional environment could imply the modification of the appropriate development of interaction of metabolic circuits and therefore affect metabolism Microglia are involved in synaptogenesis throughout the brain however there is little information regarding the specific effects of microglia on the development of the synaptic interactions of metabolic circuits These glial cells have been shown to have an active role in the sexual differentiation of behavior and masculinization of the brain suggesting that they may indeed be important for the development of endocrine circuits and possibly the sexual differentiation of some of these systems Modifications in the synaptic connectivity of metabolic circuits occur in postnatal life in response to metabolic and hormonal signals and are most likely involved in the adaptation to changes in energy inputs conditions in attempt to maintain metabolic homeostasis with astroglia participating in these synaptic rearrangements HFD is associated with an increase in the glial coverage of both POMC and NPY cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus which is coincident with a decrease in the number of synaptic inputs to the perikarya of these neurons However there is a decline in stimulatory inputs to NPY neurons and of inhibitory inputs to POMC neurons which would result in an overall decline in orexigenic signaling When first given a HFD rodents experience a phase of hyperphagia that is normally followed by an attenuation of this rise in energy intake The levels of polysialic acid are rapidly increased in the arcuate nucleus in response to HFD This glycogen can attach to cell membrane proteins to weaken interactions and facilitate synaptic reorganization If PSA is enzymatically removed from adhesion molecule in the hypothalamus HFD induced modifications in metabolic circuits can be blocked and the adaptation to hyperphagia attenuated In addition studies in photoperiodic models have shown that PSA and NCAM levels in tanycytes are reduced during short photoperiods in conjunction with vimentin levels modulating the plasticity for tanycyte connections with arcuate neurons Diverse hormonal metabolic signals could be involved in these structural modifications including leptin This hormone rapidly induces synaptic changes in metabolic circuits with some of these effects being mediated through astrocytes These glial cells express different isoforms of ObR with the expression of this receptor being increased in astrocytes of obese rodents Leptin can modify astrocyte morphology inducing changes in the length and number of primary astrocytic projections and astroglial coverage of hypothalamic neurons The lack of leptin signaling due to the of this receptor in astrocytes changes synaptic inputs to POMC and NPY neurons resulting in modifications in the function of these metabolic neurons and rendering the animals less susceptible to the effects of leptin However it remains unclear as to the mechanisms involved in the changes in neuronal glial interactions including identification of the initial step that triggers these morphological modifications Astrocytes modulate neuronal transmission by controlling glutamate concentrations in the synaptic cleft which also plays an important role in preventing excitotoxicity Leptin and ghrelin modulate glutamate uptake by these glial cells and could thus affect stimulatory signaling in metabolic circuits through this mechanism Astrocytes also actively participate in synaptic transmission and plasticity by releasing gliotransmitters including adenosine ATP d glutamate and tumor necrosis factor that directly activate postsynaptic receptors and by altering neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neuronal elements to induce plasticity and to modulate synaptic efficacy Adenosine release by astrocytes inhibits the firing rate of AgRP neurons and food intake modifying the response to metabolic hormones such as ghrelin Inflammatory Response The inflammatory response to infection foreign substances mechanical damage or any situation that could damage neurons is one of the best studied functions of glial cells However the description of hypothalamic inflammation in obesity as well as its association with the development of secondary complications is more recent In the group of Licio Velloso reported that inflammatory pathways were activated in the hypothalamus in obese rats This same group went on to demonstrate that this hypothalamic inflammation was involved in the disruption of systemic glucose homeostasis Numerous studies have since reported the link between hypothalamic inflammation and comorbidities Hypothalamic inflammation is reported to be associated with the development of insulin resistance and type diabetes and increased cell death in the hypothalamus Most studies analyzing hypothalamic inflammation have employed obesity models and suggest that dietary factors are involved in at least part of the inflammatory response Indeed hypothalamic inflammation is reported to occur even before an increase in adiposity or systemic inflammation are detected and central administration of saturated fatty acids directly activates inflammatory signaling mechanisms in the hypothalamus However increased weight gain can occur in response to genetic epigenetic and excess energy intake that is not due to increased fat consumption and the hypothalamic inflammatory gliosis response differs depending on the underlying cause of weight gain These differential responses are most likely the result of dietary signals and the changes in metabolic signals associated to weight gain acting on both microglia and astrocytes Sex may also be a factor as the hypothalamic inflammatory response to chronic is reported to differ between males and females with males being more susceptible This could result from the greater rise in PA levels in the CNS of male mice compared to females even though there is no sex difference in circulating fatty acid levels Inhibition of hypothalamic inflammation is reported to blunt or block the development of complications and dietary restriction can reverse central inflammatory processes Exercise also protects against hypothalamic inflammation Microglia in Hypothalamic Inflammation Microglia the innate immune cells of the CNS are the first line of defense in response to foreign substances and are activated in response to saturated fat consumption Indeed these glial cells are suggested to dictate the inflammation that occurs in response to saturated fats Microglia can also be activated when weight gain is due to excess intake of a normal diet and due to high fat intake indicating that not only dietary signals are involved Leptin stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines from microglia suggesting that hyperleptinemia could be involved in microglial activation in obese subjects Astrocytes in Hypothalamic Inflammation Astrocytes also respond to HFD intake and can be directly activated in vitro by fatty acids Hyperleptinemia associated with weight gain may also participate in the activation of glia in situation of obesity Indeed ob ob mice which are dramatically obese due to the genetic lack of leptin do not exhibit astrogliosis and weight loss actually increases astrocytic profiles in the hypothalamus of these animals However we have found that in some situations of increased weight gain such as increased carbohydrate intake in the form of sucrose astrocytic markers may actually be decreased The astrogliosis response to HFD differs between males and females as does the in vitro response to PA The protective effects of estrogens are exerted through in astrocytes with estrogens protecting against PA activation of astrocytes in vitro Morselli et al demonstrated that reduces hypothalamic levels in males but not in females which may be involved in the decreased protection against obesity in males Astrocytes have also been implicated in determining the preference for a HFD with this mechanism involving cannabinoid receptor The intake of a HFD induces the preference for this type of diet and this appears to involve the production of endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus Leptin signaling in astrocytes is regulated by with disruption of in these glial cells resulting in the inability of leptin to regulate glycogen storage and thus possibly affecting central energy storage and glucose sensing signaling Conclusion It is clear that cells are fundamental for the correct functioning of metabolic circuits beginning with the essential process of regulating the nutrients and signals that reach these neurons These cells are not only involved with the development maintenance and protection of their neuronal neighbors but participate in all aspects of neuronal function in Figure In the hypothalamus numerous studies have shown how cells play an active role in the control of metabolism and in the pathological outcomes of poor metabolic control Although the advances in laboratory techniques and genetically engineered animal models have increased our knowledge in this field there is yet much to be learned regarding the mechanisms involved Studies directed at developing markers to further identify different populations or subclasses of glial cells are of great importance in order to better understand the vast roles that these cells play in the different physiological functions controlled by the CNS This increased knowledge will also hopefully add to our understanding of pathophysiological processes and future targets for treatments including that of obesity and its secondary complications Figure Schematic representation of the main roles of hypothalamic cells in metabolism Thin arrows represent the different connections between cells fueling and sensing of nutrients signaling through gliotransmitters neurotransmitters or other factors and recycling of molecules or cleaning of cellular debris Hormones and nutrients from the bloodstream pass through one or more types of cells before reaching neurons sometimes suffering metabolic changes during the process In response to a metabolic imbalance of saturated fatty acids hyperleptinemia microglial cells change to an activated state releasing inflammatory factors such as cytokines and activating astrocytes as a neuroprotective measure If the insult continues it can lead to gliosis hypothalamic inflammation and neuronal damage Author Contributions All authors have contributed to

terms Ethiopia recently introduced the Doctor of Physiotherapy degree at Addis Ababa University as a mechanism to increase the work force capacity of primary care providers in the health sector The DPT program was supported by an international academic partnership and was designed to empower physiotherapists as leaders to move the profession forward The curriculum was framed by core pedagogical principles and strategies and was phased into two programs First the Advanced Standing DPT program focused on developing registered Ethiopian physiotherapists with Bachelor of Science degrees as academic faculty Second these new faculty would then sustain a Generic DPT program that would matriculate students upon graduation from high school The curriculum represented depth and breadth of foundation and clinical sciences practice clinical reasoning skills and interprofessional education opportunities A leadership thread provided opportunities to develop skills necessary to effectively navigate and manage the challenges faced by the profession The main outcomes included an international partnership the academic performance of students and and leadership capabilities as demonstrated through activities and assignments While the program has been criticized as an unnecessary extravagance for Ethiopia the advantages of the DPT degree were revealed in a direct comparison to other academic physiotherapy programs in Ethiopia In the end because the DPT is new to the country it will take time to fully understand the true impact within the Ethiopian health system Ethiopia Doctor of Physiotherapy leadership development academic partnership empowerment Physiotherapy Profession Historical Perspective The PT profession in Ethiopia is relatively new when compared to the history of the profession in other countries The modern era of the PT profession is thought to have begun in Europe toward the end of the nineteenth century The early origins of physical therapy practice began in settings to address the rehabilitation needs resulting from World War I causalities and for individuals impacted by disease epidemics like poliomyelitis Today PTs manage patients with a broad array of health conditions and practice in many different settings including hospitals rural health outposts rehabilitation homes and centers private and public outpatient clinics public schools pediatric and geriatric settings and specialized rehabilitation centers The progression of responsibilities and educational standards for entry into the profession has paralleled this expansion The profession has moved from teaching technical skills like exercise and massage to strategies for examination evaluation diagnosis prognosis and intervention of individuals with multisystem health conditions More than years later the profession has transformed its education from short programs with highly circumscribed knowledge and skill sets to more comprehensive and rigorous professional education programs that culminate in undergraduate and graduate degrees While not all countries regulate curriculum some national associations and the World Confederation for Physical Therapy have established guidelines for education requirements Throughout the world degrees span school diplomas to and Bachelor of Science Master of Science and and Doctor of Physiotherapy Historically African nations have offered primarily diplomas and have struggled to upgrade the diploma to a degree program Ethiopia is an exception with the existence of BSc MSc and DPT degree options BSc and MSc Degree Programs Gondar University At the beginning of the century Ethiopia had PTs registered to serve an estimated million Ethiopians living with disabilities In response to the critical shortage of PT workforce capacity volunteers from the Netherlands and a team of Ethiopian physicians pioneered the Department of Physiotherapy at University of Gondar The program sought be the best Physiotherapy Department in terms of education health care and research in East Africa by the year They defined their mission as to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the country achieving our goals through the provision of societal needs tailored education conducting problem based research and delivering preventive and rehabilitative services in the field of physiotherapy The BSc program continues to be supported by international faculty from India and the Netherlands The first cohort of PTs graduated in with a total estimated graduation of PTs as of The BSc curriculum integrates most of the basic foundational technical skill sets for education set forth by the WCPT However there is no apparent structure to support practice leadership development critical thinking problem solving and professional judgment skill sets that are recognized as current best practices within the profession worldwide As a mechanism to further advance the profession Gondar University initiated a MSc in Physiotherapy degree in The MSc curriculum expanded the knowledge base in the content areas of neurologic orthopedic pediatric PT and research methods The MSc program generally accepts a maximum of four BSc prepared PTs each year To date the MSc program has graduated an estimated PTs and is supported by international faculty from the University of South Australia and the Netherlands Table Gondar University BSc CH and MSc

System Challenges for PTs in Ethiopia As with the introduction of any new health profession Ethiopian PTs have met professional challenges within the health sector which has impacted the general motivation by some to pursue or continue a career in PT Thus despite the development of the University of Gondar programs Ethiopia continues to experience limitations in human resource capacity to meet the demand for rehabilitation services There are a number of potential causes for the limitations First there is a lack of overt public and government support for the physical therapists possibly due to a limited understanding of this relatively new Ethiopian profession Second the Ministry of Education assigns school students to the academic program based on their interests in health care and on their performance on the Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Certificate Examination It is perceived that some of those assigned to PT programs would prefer to seek opportunities in other health professions Third while Ethiopian physicians have opportunities for continued professional development the PT profession has extremely limited opportunity in this area Thus the growth and development of individual practitioners and the profession as a whole is limited by this void Fourth poor salary compensation may cause PTs to seek additional ways to supplement their income or they choose to leave the profession altogether Fifth a shortage of qualified local PT faculty limits the ability to sustain the academic programs without international support In addition local faculty may not be fully qualified for academic roles as they often receive little to no formal training in teaching pedagogy nor advanced PT skill sets to optimally integrate into the academy Finally Ethiopia has a broad Scope of Practice for the PT profession that is dependent upon the level of academic preparation This leads to disparities in the delivery of patient care among PT providers The sum of the limitations greatly impacts the profession throughout the country Therefore the focus of this special topic paper is to describe the development of the DPT program at Addis Ababa University as a potential strategy to alleviate the impact of the many limitations on the PT work force capacity in Ethiopia DPT Degree Programs AAU The DPT was introduced to Ethiopia at AAU in The program defined the vision to recognized in Africa as a center of excellence for education and service provision by doctors of physiotherapy These doctors will be physical medicine experts who deliver optimal patient care and contribute to the goals of the health sector The development of the DPT program was planned in a partnership between AAU Regis University CO the Jackson Clinics Foundation LLC VA Over the planning period the partnership developed relationships with several Ethiopian stakeholders that played critical roles in the formation and approval of the DPT program at AAU The partners encountered many challenges during this planning phase mostly related to the frequent replacement of the AAU College of Health Science and School of Medicine Deans and Directors and the accompanying breakdowns in communication between outgoing and incoming administrators Despite the challenges the AAU Senate ultimately approved the Advanced DPT Standing program in and matriculated the inaugural cohort of registered PTs shortly thereafter Figure Web of partner relationships for the development of the DPT program at AAU DPT Doctor of AAU Addis Ababa CHS AAU College of Health SOM AAU School of RU Regis University The introduction of the DPT at AAU was designed to occur in two phases as follows the Advanced Standing DPT Program and the Generic DPT Program Phase Advanced Standing DPT Program The Advanced Standing DPT program was developed with consideration of the social and economic development level of the country analysis of history development and present status of the PT profession in Ethiopia and in other countries educational sector development plan of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia health sector development plan of FDRE standards of admission program design licensing and accreditation needs for the education of PT professionals and new developments in research within the profession of PT The scope of the Advanced Standing curriculum was substantially greater than the Gondar BSc curriculum and was tailored to match the experience of the registered PTs and to specifically prepare them for professional roles as faculty of the Generic DPT program The graduation of the first cohort of Advanced Standing students is anticipated in May They will officially assume their roles as core and or clinical faculty for the Generic DPT program in Fall Table Addis Ababa

IPE collaboration in the classroom and in clinical practice and thereby expand potential for improved patient outcomes Ultimately the Generic DPT program will be fully sustained by PT faculty developed in the Advanced Standing program in coordination with the AAU medical school faculty International faculty will not be needed to sustain the Generic DPT program AAU plans to matriculate the first cohort of Generic DPT students in Fall Pedagogical Principles and Framework for the DPT Curriculum Core Pedagogy Principles The development of the DPT curriculum was guided by six core pedagogical principles that emphasized empowerment leadership relationships active engagement reflection and innovation Principle empowerment through learning is the path to the future Principle leaders dwell within everyone Principle relationships form the basis of all learning Principle students achieve growth by challenging the process and modeling the way Principle active engagement amplifies learning achievement Principle reflective processes inspire innovation Pedagogy Framework Doctor of Physiotherapy The pedagogical framework was designed to build upon the six core principles while acknowledging the local context of the physical medicine and rehabilitation needs of Ethiopia the Scope of Practice and the constraints of a health environment The DPT student was the primary focus of the framework which aimed to empower engage motivate inspire transform and develop leaders for the profession Figure Pedagogical framework for the Doctor of Physiotherapy programs Scope of Practice The framework required a thorough understanding of the vision of the PT profession in Ethiopia and was thus guided by the Scope of Practice The Ethiopian Physiotherapy Association and the Ethiopian Food Medicine and Health Care Administration and Control Authority jointly wrote the Scope of Practice The academic degree determines the scope of duties that a PT can perform e g technician BSC MSc and DPT Ethiopian DPT practitioners have the highest capacity of all academic PT degrees to deliver primary care services Pedagogical Format and Curriculum As previously stated the Advanced Standing DPT and Generic DPT programs curricula were specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Ethiopia Ethiopia aimed to increase the workforce capacity by including PTs as primary care providers in the health system Thus the DPT curriculum had to expand its scope beyond the BSc and MSc to meet the expectations and responsibilities that accompany the provision of primary care For example Ethiopian DPTs needed training to order medically relevant diagnostic tests participate in the management of medical surgical emergencies or trauma perform specialty interventions such as mechanical decompression plastering techniques joint and soft tissue injections prescribe neuromusculoskeletal medications perform minor trauma suturing reduce and stabilize minor fractures and dislocations and perform electromyography lower extremity Doppler tests and stress tests The curriculum also included a leadership thread to cultivate and empower leaders for the PT profession A teaching and learning thread was also woven throughout the curriculum to develop Ethiopian faculty that could independently sustain the academic programs Finally the curriculum was taught with IPE collaboration among the faculty and students from other health professions to facilitate networking and teamwork among health professionals The curriculum was delivered in accordance with the guidelines for AAU College of Health Sciences School of Medicine modular undergraduate curriculum The Advanced Standing DPT program included courses that were sectioned into content modules Modules Human Anatomy and Development Physiology and Kinesiology of Movement Clinical Decision Making Cardiovascular and Pulmonary System Management Movement Sciences Studies Neurological Systems Management Radiology Musculoskeletal Management Musculoskeletal Management Specialized Medical Management of the Musculoskeletal System Professional Roles Population Health Integumentary and Endocrinology Urogenital Oncology Research Methods Scope of Physiotherapy Practice All courses were delivered in a blocked design where students were required to take one course to completion before beginning the next course and subsequent module The blocked design also accommodated the international faculty travel schedules The Generic program will also be taught with a modular system but will be taught with a traditional distributed delivery model rather than a blocked model In addition the Generic program will expand the curriculum to thus new courses will be sectioned into new modules Modules Body Structure Organization and Function Metabolic Homeostasis and Molecular Genetics Basic Concepts of Disease and Therapy Blood and Immunity Neoplasia and the Molecular Basis of Cancer Musculoskeletal and Integumentary Systems Cardiopulmonary System Nutrition Metabolic Diseases and GIT Excretion and Toxicology Infectious Disease Endocrinology and Reproduction Neuroscience and Behavior The additional modules will be taught by AAU medical school faculty and represent the current foundational courses for medical students The DPT students will take these courses alongside medical students during their first years of the curriculum Pedagogical Strategies and Learning Environment The Advanced Standing DPT program employed several pedagogical strategies throughout the curriculum to meet the needs of diverse learners and to expose the students to a variety of strategies that would be available to them as they prepared for their roles as future faculty Learning Environment The curriculum was delivered with a hybrid model that utilized and delivery models to accommodate the availability of experienced international faculty instruction incorporated both didactic and practical skill development and was delivered in a traditional classroom on the AAU School of Medical campus was primarily utilized for the delivery of didactic content and was delivered through a Skype connection into the AAU classroom Lecture Traditional lecture formats were utilized throughout the curriculum but with intentional efforts to actively engage the student in dialog lecture formats that utilized technology with lectures classroom were also implemented when a faculty member could not be or when students needed additional course review beyond the physical structure of the classroom Labs Many of the courses incorporated lab experiences to teach learn demonstrate and practice practical skills Small Group Instruction Clinical mentoring courses for experiential patient management were performed in small groups of students The curriculum included a series of nine clinical mentoring courses A similar model will be incorporated into the Generic program Student Demonstration Instruction Adopting the model One Do One Teach One the students were frequently encouraged to assume the role of instructor to gain experience for their future roles as faculty Learning Students completed individual readiness assurance tests and team readiness assurance tests on content assigned for specific days within selected courses The TBL model encouraged learners to arrive to class fully prepared to engage in teamwork with other students Learning case scenarios were adapted for various courses to promote thoughtful reflection dialog critical thinking problem solving and group process Assessment The students were assessed with a variety of methods including written examinations quizzes practical examinations written assignments and oral presentations Partnership As stated earlier academic instruction for the Advanced Standing program was supported by an international partnership The partnership was manifested through a complex network of relationships and a memorandum of understanding that delineated the roles of each partner in supporting the program In short all partners had human resource commitments related to administrative roles and teaching responsibilities within the curriculum as well as fiscal and physical resource commitments The international partners also committed to providing mentorship to the newly formed faculty upon their graduation but do not plan to formally teach within the academic programs thereafter Competencies and Objectives The DPT curriculum represented depth and breadth of both foundational and clinical sciences and was accompanied by competencies and objectives reflective of an DPT curriculum In addition a leadership thread was woven throughout the curriculum to develop leadership for the advancement of the profession in Ethiopia The leadership goals and objectives were unique to DPT program and were not represented within the BSc program at the University of Gondar They included the following Illustrate the social responsibilities of a doctoring profession Advocate for patient and community needs Commit to meet professional obligations Consider the determinants that impact societal health and wellness Adhere to high ethical principles and professional values and standards Accept responsibility for roles obligations and actions of the physiotherapist Consider social emotional and psychological components in patient care Acknowledge that effective health care depends on a mutual understanding and relationship between the team patient and the family with respect for the welfare culture identity beliefs and autonomy Demonstrate actions ahead of the of the physiotherapist by treating patients with politeness and consideration respecting their dignity privacy and point of view without regard to background culture language religion race and point of view Participate in lifelong learning to ensure ongoing high levels of knowledge and clinical competence Serve as leaders to elevate the standards of PT care in Ethiopia to best meet the needs of society Current Results and Outcomes Partnership As stated previously the partnership experienced significant turnover within the AAU academic administration The Executive Director of the college of Health Sciences changed three times the Academic Dean of the School of Medicine changed four times the Associate Dean of the College of Health Sciences changed four times the Director of Undergraduate Medical Education changed three times and the Director of the Department of Orthopedics the Unit of Physiotherapy changed five times The instability and longevity of the higher education administration made the progression of the program difficult Fortunately the commitment of the DPT program Coordinator at AAU remained constant throughout all of the transitions in higher administration to sustain the partnership All partners remain committed to the progression of the academic programs Generic DPT Program Development The Generic DPT curriculum is currently in its final stage of development The curriculum is scheduled for submission to the AAU Senate for review and approval in early Once it is approved AAU will begin the process to matriculate school students into the program in Fall Advanced Standing DPT Students Survey The DPT students that matriculated into the Advanced Standing DPT program are currently completing the third year of the curriculum To date courses have been taught by a total of faculty including different AAU faculty for courses different Regis University faculty for courses and Jackson Clinics Foundation clinicians for courses An extensive survey was administered to all students at the end of their first year The survey addressed three primary areas and utilized a novice

were cardiopulmonary integumentary musculoskeletal neuromuscular orthotic prosthetic protective devices and assistive adaptive devices The domains with an average score in the novice range SD were integumentary procedural interventions and special populations The survey will be readministered at the completion of the Advanced Standing DPT program and the results will be analyzed as a component of the overall assessment of the program Leadership Development The critics of the AAU DPT degree argue that a change in academic degree will not resolve the challenges faced by the PT profession in Ethiopia Indeed they are probably right Taken at face value the expansion of the curriculum with the DPT degree is evident However less obvious was how the leadership thread served as a potential mechanism to address the aforementioned limitations The leadership thread was an integral part of the Advanced Standing program and will continue with the Generic DPT program The thread exposed students to a variety of leadership theories models and assessment tools It offered opportunities to engage in reflective processes and gain perspectives on personal leadership styles as well as the leadership traits of others Students individually and jointly reflected on their personal and professional values and future roles and responsibilities in the Ethiopian environment They also deliberated on leadership topics in groups to identify core professional values that they believed could lead the profession forward in Ethiopia The current cohort identified the core PT values as professionalism timeliness accountability knowledge and skills and transparency and coupled them with their personal values of compassion integrity love kindness and honesty Finally the cohort worked as a team to develop action verbs to accompany the personal and professional values that would enable them to act upon the identified values They chose to empower promote work demonstrate strive pursue and engage The thread required students to develop personal mission statements that could guide their journey as individual leaders in academia and clinical practice General themes that emerged from the mission statements included statements to lead the PT profession forward through active involvement in policy making to inspire and empower current and future PTs to embrace altruism in practice to advance the quality of patient care and to be accountable to the profession and those that they served The culminating activity within the leadership thread was the development and implementation of personal leadership projects The projects were a mechanism to motivate and empower them to address the challenges in Ethiopia by engaging as positive change agents The leadership projects reflected the added value of the leadership thread within the curriculum The leadership project themes ranged from being able to more fully integrate PTs as leaders within the Ministry of Health and improving the awareness of the profession in the country to improving PT work efficiencies and physical environments in hospitals and clinics to increase job satisfaction and retention of PTs in the work force The general feedback about the leadership thread from the current cohort was extremely positive as many of them believed they could be positive change agents and lead the profession forward as a result of the leadership development process Discussion Ethiopia has made great advances in developing academic programs to address the shortage of PTs in the workforce Over the past years the contributions of Gondar BSc and MSc programs have contributed over PTs to the physical medicine and rehabilitation sector The DPT programs at AAU were designed to address the mounting challenges of the profession by increasing the scope of the curriculum for primary care and developing leaders to move the profession forward The DPT programs have been subjected to criticism especially since the degree is new to Ethiopia and all of Africa The harsh opinions have included statements such as does not need doctoral education They simply need basic training to meet the general growing needs of the population does not need autonomous PTs they need to work with the physicians as a team BSc degree works around the world Does the world really need the American DPT To the critics it can be argued that the challenges will only continue to grow if innovation is not pursued Examination of the different curricular models in Ethiopia revealed the advantages of DPT degree compared to the BSc and MSc degree Benefits to the profession included developing advancing clinical reasoning skills and application of practice beyond the technical skill sets associated with the BSc and MSc broadening the depth of foundational and clinical practice knowledge to fully address the professional scope of practice in primary promoting a culture of lifelong learning and service to envisioning positive change for the future of the instituting IPE in educational curricula and clinical practice for optimization of patient developing local faculty to sustain academic increasing the potential for greater income as the DPT will be compensated on a doctoral scale like and improving the potential for greater recognition and sustained increased in work force capacity within the profession While preliminary data have been collected related to professional behaviors roles and responsibilities of the DPT profession principles for patient management and system and management future analysis of data from graduation surveys will serve as quantitative markers of the impact of the program Limitations and Recommendations The greatest limitation of the DPT program at AAU has been the inconsistencies of higher administration support due to the frequent turnover of personnel It is strongly recommended that the primary coordinator director of the program have a strong presence in the daily academic environment to ensure stability and sustainability of the program Limitations were also noted in the availability of AAU medical school faculty and international PT faculty The MOU designated courses to be taught by the AAU medical school faculty but it was often difficult to secure the actual commitment of the faculty The challenge was related to difficulties in communication and expectations between higher administration and the faculty For almost all of the international faculty they could only commit to teach in blocks due to ongoing responsibilities within their home institutions Students reported that they would have preferred the courses to be taught over a to timeframe to allow time to fully integrate the course materials In addition the expense to send international faculty to Ethiopia was quite high The opportunities for external funding and grants were essentially for the DPT program as most grants funds directed to Africa targeted HIV AIDS TB malaria and other medical student education programs Advocacy for the PT education and profession grants in Africa would be strongly encouraged Finally the DPT program at AAU was specifically designed to meet the unique needs of Ethiopia and thus the curriculum may not be fully generalizable to other countries However the degree has many benefits that warrant careful consideration as a potential mechanism to upgrade the diploma to a degree in Africa With this in mind the process by which the DPT was developed in Ethiopia is indeed generalizable The process involved a grassroots movement of Ethiopian PTs a collaborative partnership for expertise would be difficult for any one person to have all the necessary expertise to develop a new academic model in any support of internal and external governing bodies etc and students willing to commit to a pioneering academic program The process requires time to navigate necessary systems to launch the program It is very important to be patient Due diligence to complete all requirements to launch a new program is the ultimate key to facilitating the sustainability and success of the DPT degree Conclusion Since the program is still very new it will take time to understand the impact of the DPT in Ethiopia The only marker that exists at this time is the performance of the students currently enrolled in the Advanced Standing program all of who graduated from the BSc program at Gondar University One particular student comment stands out to reflect the value of the DPT program I never knew what it was to be a PT until I started the DPT program So the question to be asked is the DPT make a difference in Ethiopia If any credence is to be applied to the empowerment potential of the leaders being developed in the Advanced Standing DPT program then the answer will hopefully emerge as the DPT can make a difference Author Contributions CF the lead instructor for the Doctor of Physiotherapy

Disorder but the experience of mental effort has received relatively little attention in the empirical study of individuals for ADHD We explored a novel method to assess the experience of effort and discomfort during a working memory task in a sample of young adults and not for ADHD Method A sample of undergraduate students age were included in this study Based on an participants met criteria for the group and were in the risk group Results Individuals for ADHD reported higher mental effort and discomfort than individuals not for ADHD even when performance on the working memory task was comparable or statistically controlled Mental effort required and discomfort were more strongly correlated for compared to not participants Individuals for ADHD displayed a stronger correlation between mental effort required and actual accuracy but individuals not for ADHD displayed a stronger association between perceived accuracy and actual accuracy for the hardest experimental conditions The most intense moment of effort required predicted retrospective discomfort ratings of the task in the group but not in the group Conclusion The subjective experience of in the moment mental effort is an important and viable construct that should be more carefully defined and measured In particular the experience of effort required how taxing a task differentiated between individuals and individuals not for ADHD in the present study Whereas previous ADHD research has explored effort exerted the present work demonstrated that investigating the experience of being mentally taxed might provide a productive line of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the cognitive and affective mechanisms underlying the regulation of effort in individuals of ADHD experience of effort mental effort subjective ratings cognitive abilities Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Introduction The point of departure for the present work is the observation that there are individual differences in how mentally effortful tasks are experienced For some a cognitively demanding task is a welcomed opportunity for others such a task end soon enough Individual differences are evident in both what it feels like the to complete a mentally effortful task g this task is requiring a lot of see for example Paas von Helversen et al Robinson and Morsella and thoughts and about mental effort g I often find math questions require a lot of see for example Dornic et al Cacioppo et al This difference between effort in the moment and generalized thoughts and feelings largely maps onto the classic distinction between states and traits In this study we focused on measuring the in the moment experience of effort during a cognitively demanding task In addition we identified individuals for Hyperactivity Disorder as avoidance of effortful tasks is diagnostic of these individuals American Psychiatric Association We examined differences between those for ADHD and those not in terms of their experience of mental effort during a cognitive demanding task and whether these differences were separable from task performance The the versus thoughts and about mental effort distinction provides some conceptual clarity for understanding the experience of mental effort but there is still a long way to go in defining this construct in a more precise manner for proper empirical investigation In part this is because the experience of mental effort is a broad and often concept with a variety of different aspects Like the proverbial blind men researchers have grasped different aspects of the elephant and come to different understandings There are at least three distinct aspects of mental effort that need to be distinguished in subjective Participants can report hard I e effort volitionally taxed I e effort extracted for level of and difficult the task e effort potentially The key difference between hard I and taxed I relates to agency The first puts the emphasis on what one brings to the that is level of motivation and energy to do best or not Whereas the second puts the emphasis on what the task does to the that is how much the task burdened or required of the individual It is possible to imagine situations where a person might report trying hard to do their best but also report finding that the task did not require a lot of them This conceptual distinction has borne out empirically For example Mulert et al found that amount of e how taxed I varied in direct proportion to objective task difficulty whereas amount of e how hard I was more constant across variations in task difficulty The key difference between taxed I and difficult the task is whether the focus is on the burden experienced by the individual or on the external task and its characteristics The first puts the emphasis on what the task does to the individual how much the task burdened or required of me whereas the second puts the emphasis on characteristics of the task whether it is difficult relative to other possible tasks It is possible to imagine situations where a person might report feeling very taxed and report that the task was not very perhaps they did not get a good night of sleep and are thus very inattentive but recognize that relative to other tasks this one is actually not that difficult This conceptual distinction has also been borne out empirically For example Otto et al found that the ratings of mental effort e how taxed I felt were associated with increased activation in the left anterior insular cortex compared to ratings of task difficulty e how difficult the task is during a working memory task Taken as a whole there are conceptual and empirical reasons to believe that investigators studying mental effort must take care to distinguish between these different aspects of the experience of mental effort Mental effort is central to the definition of ADHD surprisingly however this topic has garnered relatively little systematic research One of the ADHD criterion stipulates that an individual with ADHD avoids dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort g schoolwork or for older adolescents and adults preparing reports completing forms reviewing lengthy American Psychiatric Association Given the requirement for pervasiveness of signs and symptoms in order to obtain a diagnosis of ADHD this diagnostic criterion suggests a dispositional quality related to avoidance of effort in individuals with ADHD The Brown Scale is a standardized tool that was developed to provide a broader clinical characterization of the inattentive symptoms and executive problems associated with ADHD Brown This measure includes an Effort Scale defined by inconsistent energy and inconsistent sustained effort It appears that the Effort Scale is assessing something akin to the how hard I try aspect of mental effort given that items suggest a lack of energy and a failure to work to potential Adolescents with ADHD have reported more difficulty sustaining effort as indicated by significant differences on the Effort Scale compared to an adolescent control group Rucklidge and Tannock Similarly the Cognitive and Motivation in Everyday Life Scale Van Liefferinge et al which assesses neuropsychological impairments in children and youth with ADHD appears to tap into the hard I aspect of mental effort Sample items from the Effort Allocation Scale of the CAMEL are time to to get going on a things off until the last minute and the way with least effort Parents were asked to rate their children and youth based on the extent to which the items described their behavior using a Likert scale Children with ADHD scored significantly lower on this scale compared to children in the community sample demonstrating a medium effect size indicating difficulties with effort allocation in the clinical group model has proposed a role for state effort in explaining ADHD deficits In this model effort is conceptualized as a state factor arousal and which is separable from computational mechanisms as encoding search decision and motor and management or evaluation mechanisms to executive Specifically effort is defined as necessary energy to meet the demands of a Sergeant p In this model task demands are thought to impact effort whereby greater cognitive load elicits greater mobilization of energy Relatively little research has examined the energetic state component of model However children with ADHD have been shown to perform more poorly in tasks with slow compared to fast event rates Sergeant et al Unlike previous research on ADHD and mental effort model focuses on state the effort But like previous ADHD research this model appears to be focusing on the hard I aspect of mental effort That is suggesting that individuals with ADHD struggle to mobilize and volitionally exert the effort needed especially on tasks that are Given that avoidance of mentally effortful tasks is a diagnostic criterion of ADHD it is somewhat surprising that relatively little systematic research has been done on the topic Most of the research has focused on ratings of general thoughts feelings and dispositions and even more specifically trait dispositions regarding how hard individuals try to complete mentally effortful tasks A smaller amount of work largely centered around theory has modeled a key role for in the moment considerations focusing on how much effort is exerted To our knowledge no research has examined whether individuals with ADHD or related difficulties systematically differ in their experience of they are by cognitive tasks compared to individuals Given that many theories of mental effort postulate that the experience of being mentally taxed may serve as a regulatory signal to disengage from effortful tasks g Kurzban investigating the experience of being mentally taxed in individuals with difficulties may prove to be a productive focus of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the regulation of effort in samples Thus the overarching goal of the present work was to systematically describe how the subjective experience of mental effort required e experience of being burdened or is different for individuals for ADHD compared to those not for ADHD In the current study we modeled our experimental design and data analytic approach on a pain study completed by Redelmeier and Kahneman During colonoscopy and lithotripsy medical procedures were painful procedures at the time their study was Redelmeier and Kahneman asked participants to report their level of pain every s Then within h of completing the medical procedure participants were asked to recall the total amount of pain they experienced These authors found that the most intense ratings of pain during the procedure and the final ratings of pain at the end of the procedure were the most robust predictors of retrospective ratings this phenomenon has come to be called the effect In a review of research on the effect Fredrickson argued that the broader principle is that moments of personal significance or salience are the best predictors of recall and that peak and final moments are typically salient for most people Applying this methodology from the pain literature we assessed how taxed and uncomfortable participants felt during the completion of a cognitively demanding task and how uncomfortable participants recall the task to be after it was completed We also measured their actual performance and their perceived performance We examined whether individuals for ADHD would find a cognitively demanding task more taxing e effort and uncomfortable than individuals not for ADHD Specifically we used an in the moment methodology that provides a specific reference point to a cognitively demanding task for these ratings We asked participants to rate the effort required and discomfort at regular intervals during this task We predicted that the group would rate the task as requiring more effort and as more uncomfortable than the group even when performance accuracy was comparable in both groups Further if effort required and discomfort is more salient in the group these ratings should be more strongly associated with performance accuracy among the group than in the group Finally given our predictions regarding the salience of effort required and discomfort in the group we predicted that the most intense peak of effort required would be particularly strong predictors of the retrospective memories of discomfort associated with the working memory task Given the novelty of the methodology used in this study we examined our hypotheses in extreme groups that were identified using on an ADHD symptom screening measure ADHD and ADHD Materials and Methods Ethics Statement The experimental protocol was approved by the Human Participants Review Committee of York Office of Research Ethics Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the very beginning of the research protocol before any data was collected Participants were free to withdraw consent at any time and still receive course credit Participants A sample of participants age SD was selected for inclusion in this study from a larger sample of university undergraduate students age SD age range female who participated in a larger study for course credit Data from participants were excluded from the analyses for the following reasons participants failed the practice trials on the working memory task participants were deemed to be outliers due to excessively poor performance on the working memory task e accuracy at any block was more than three standard deviations away from the mean of the blocks with the same or participants had incomplete or missing data Some data from these participants are reported in another study addressing different questions et al In the present study we used the adult ADHD Symptom Checklist screener Kessler et al to identify extreme groups so that we could compare participants with difficulties to participants who are not Namely participants who scored above the threshold on four or more items were identified as of ADHD and participants who score above the threshold on one or zero items were classified as not Based on this ASRS screening criterion we selected participants age SD and not participants age SD for the ADHD group resulting in a total of participants for final analysis The two groups did not differ in age and gender p Measures Working Memory Task We used an adapted version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test Gronwall to elicit mental effort In this task digits were visually presented on a computer screen one at a time in a continuous stream Participants were asked to continuously add the numerical digits Each digit was presented on the screen for s An orienting auditory beep was simultaneously presented with each digit The delay between the offset of one digit and the onset of the next digit was s Participants were instructed to sum the last two digits they had seen and to enter their response using a keyboard Participants were able to respond as soon as the latest digit appeared and during the s thus within a response window of s Each required participants to provide a total of sums e trials with a total of digits The task had five conditions differing in duration i e the number of blocks ranging from five to nine blocks Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions Each block was one of three levels of difficulty easy medium or hard Task difficulty was randomly varied within participants such that each participant received one easy block one hard block and three to seven medium difficulty blocks depending on the duration condition completed The blocks were presented in a sequence such that the first and last blocks were always medium difficulty The intervening blocks were composed of one easy one hard and one to five medium blocks The hard trials involved adding one single and one double digit The medium trials involved adding two single digits that summed to more than nine The easy trials involved adding two single digits that summed to nine or less At the start of the PASAT participants completed two practice blocks of medium difficulty to ensure they fully comprehended the task and to familiarize them with the task demands Following the practice blocks participants were asked some questions regarding their anticipated experience of the task how much mental effort they expected would be required to complete the task and how much discomfort they expected during the the data on these questions were not examined in this After each block of trials participants were required to rate their experience of effort and discomfort Specifically the questions were your current level of mental A and your current level of discomfort or A These scores are referred to as mental effort and discomfort ratings as they were obtained during the PASAT After completing the PASAT task participants completed a demographic and questionnaire that was approximately min in duration After completing the demographic questionnaire participants were required to retrospectively evaluate their experience with the PASAT task Specifically the questions included much mental effort in total was required to complete this working memory task A this working memory task what was your total amount of discomfort or distress A well did you perform on the working memory Significantly below Significantly above and willing would you be to do another working memory task right now Not at all Definitely Progressive Matrices Advanced items from the Progressive Matrices were used to assess intelligence Raven et al This task contains a series of designs with a missing part Participants were instructed to complete the design by selecting the missing part from eight options This task had trials in total and a time limit of min The number of correct responses was summed such that a higher score indicated higher ability ADHD Scale The ADHD scale screener was developed by Kessler et al and is based on symptoms of ADHD described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Participants are asked to rate their level of each symptom based on the last months Of the symptoms Kessler et al found six items to be highly predictive of ADHD and these six items comprise the screener Within the six items of the screener four are based on symptoms of inattention with the other two based on hyperactivity Sample question includes How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations It is scored using a Likert scale rarely sometimes often and very alpha for this scale was Each item has a frequency threshold and participants who scored above the threshold on four or more items were identified as the group and participants who scored above the threshold on one or zero items were identified as the ADHD group Statistical Analyses In order to examine differences between the and groups we used independent t to examine differences in ratings of mental effort and discomfort task performance slopes of mental effort and discomfort and ability correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between effort and discomfort and between the average of mental effort discomfort perceived performance and actual performance on the PASAT separately in the and groups The group differences in correlations were examined using r z transformation Finally the association between effort and and retrospective discomfort were examined separately in the and groups including regression analyses to examine whether the most intense ratings of effort interacted with ADHD status in predicting retrospective ratings of discomfort Results Did the and ADHD Group Differ in Their Experience of Mental Effort As evident in Table the group experienced a higher level of mental effort and discomfort during the PASAT As for the retrospective evaluation the group recalled experiencing a higher level of mental effort and discomfort compared to the group The group also reported a significantly lower level of perceived performance on the PASAT and was more reluctant to repeat the task compared to the group The group performed significantly worse than the group on the PASAT especially on the hard and medium blocks of PASAT There was no group difference in accuracy on the easy block Effect sizes for each of the comparisons are presented in the final column indicating medium to large effect sizes on several of the group differences related to mental effort and discomfort Table Differences between the Hyperactivity Disorder and groups Control n Mean SD n Mean SD t d effort Average Hard

required and discomfort ratings separately for and would remain significant after statistically controlling for mean performance Group differences remained significant for both effort required F p and retrospective effort required F p Group differences also remained significant for both discomfort F p and retrospective discomfort F p The difference in the slopes of mental effort and discomfort between groups was suggesting that the change of effort and discomfort over time were comparable between the two groups There was also no significant difference in ability for the group and the risk group In addition we examined group differences in the magnitude of the correlations between effort and discomfort ratings The size of this correlation was r p in the group and the size of this correlation was r p in the group The correlation between mental effort and discomfort was significantly higher within the group as compared to the group Z p Does the Relation between Subjective Experience and Task Performance Differ between ADHD and Groups Table compares correlations between average mental effort required and task performance for the and groups The group showed significant correlations between average ratings of mental effort required and performance accuracy on the PASAT indicating that more effort required was associated with lower accuracy Alternatively the group did not show significant correlations between average mental effort required and performance accuracy The magnitude of the correlation between average mental effort and PASAT accuracy in the hard condition was significantly larger in the group compared to the group based on a Z test Z N p Thus taken together the relation between mental effort required and task performance appears to be more robust for the group than in the group especially in the most difficult condition We obtained parallel findings when we examined associations between ratings of discomfort and performance accuracy and this difference between groups was also statistically significant in the most difficult condition Z N p We also examined the association between perceived performance and actual performance in each group Both groups displayed significant positive correlations but the correlation for the group was significantly larger than for the group in the difficult condition Z N p Table Correlations between

discomfort both in the full sample and within each group We found that length of task did not systematically vary with any of these variables in the full sample in the control group or in the group Discussion In the current study we examined individual differences in the experience of mental effort Specifically we asked participants for ADHD and participants not for ADHD to rate effort required and discomfort during a cognitively demanding task We found that the group reported higher levels of mental effort required e how taxed they and discomfort during the PASAT working memory task and these differences remained significant even after controlling for task performance Individuals for ADHD were also less willing to do the working memory task again compared to the risk group The positive correlations observed between ratings of effort and discomfort in both the and control groups are consistent with the idea that the experience of effort is unpleasant and aversive Stanovich Kahneman Kurzban et al Researchers have suggested that effortful tasks tend to trigger an unpleasant aversive state because human cognitive system naturally seeks to minimize the expenditure of effort Kurzban et al In this sense cognitive demands are evaluated as being costly and typically trigger avoidance coping behaviors Botvinick Importantly however the experience of effort required was more strongly associated with discomfort for individuals for ADHD than for the group as indicated by the significant difference in the size of the correlations between effort and discomfort ratings Moreover we found that average effort and retrospective effort differed significantly in the and groups even after controlling for task performance These findings are consistent with the theoretical literature in suggesting that the experience of a cognitively demanding task may be especially uncomfortable and effortful for individuals who struggle with difficulties Brown Sergeant Rucklidge and Tannock Van Liefferinge et al In summary individuals for ADHD experienced the working memory task to require more effort and to be more uncomfortable even after controlling for task and they also found the experience of effort and discomfort to be more strongly correlated The group showed significant correlations between average ratings of mental effort required and accuracy but the group did not display significant correlations between average effort required and performance accuracy Similarly the ADHD risk group showed significant correlations between average ratings of discomfort and accuracy but the group did not display significant correlations between discomfort and accuracy These differences between the and not groups were most pronounced for the hardest experimental conditions Namely in the hardest experimental conditions the experience of effort required and discomfort were more tightly associated with actual performance accuracy for the group compared to the group In contrast in the hardest experimental conditions the perception of performance and actual accuracy were more tightly associated for the group compared to the group Taken together these results suggest the best subjective report for predicting actual performance on particularly challenging working memory tasks is perceived performance for the whereas the participants are less accurate in their perception of how well they are doing For the group perceptions of performance and the experience of effort and discomfort were similarly related to actual accuracy These sets of associations suggest that some type of tracking of actual performance is happening during the task but that what is being tracked may differ across groups These intercorrelations among the effort discomfort perceived performance and actual accuracy in each group may provide some further insights into understanding the differences between each group Peak effort required was a significant predictor of retrospective discomfort in the group but not in the group Moreover the interaction between ADHD group status and peak effort predicted retrospective discomfort suggesting that the most intense experience of effort required was highly related to their memory of discomfort That peak effort required interacted with group status suggests that moments of peak effort are particularly significant and salient for individuals for ADHD and thus may be particularly defining for these individuals when they recall tasks review by Fredrickson We however did not find evidence to suggest that the final moments of a cognitively demanding task are differentially salient in determining task recollection for individuals of ADHD compared to those not It may be that endings are equally salient for those for ADHD compared to those that are not In our view it will be fruitful to explore the in the moment experience of mental effort in a more nuanced manner which disentangles subjective judgments of effort demanded how taxed I effort exerted how hard I and task difficulty how difficult the task In particular these distinctions will be useful to extend the ADHD literature which has so far focused more on trait measures Brown Van Liefferinge et al and on effort exerted in the moment Sergeant We hope that our study provides a reference point for the utility of these distinctions in the experience of effort In particular the current findings suggest that individuals for ADHD may be characterized by differences in how taxed they feel during the completion of a cognitively demanding task which is meaningfully separate from ratings of task difficulty and how hard one tries on a given task Our research contributes to shifting emphasis from biomedical models that focus on the pathophysiology of disorders such as ADHD and to models that focus on the subjective experience and personal agency of the individual g and Fairchild Similarly acknowledging the value and diagnosticity of an report of how demanding the task was is consistent with such a direction It is important to acknowledge that our study was based on a sample of university students identifying and for ADHD groups The proportion of individuals in our current study was quite high and considerably higher than prevalence rates of ADHD which is closer to rates of American Psychiatric Association or Kessler et al However our proportion of participants is in line with other studies that have used the ASRS as a screening tool in undergraduate samples for ADHD symptoms such as Turel and Bechara We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our study and that future studies will be needed in order to bridge our current findings with the ADHD literature A critical step will be to examine these measures in a clinically referred sample of children adolescents and adults with diagnosed ADHD Studying the experience of mental effort will provide novel ways to assess the challenges of these individuals and to develop new directions to assess and intervene for these individuals The more precise language for describing the ways that tasks impact the individual which we are advocating here has the promise to help develop better strategies for the individual to master tasks that they may find tedious and uninteresting For example thinking of effort as a fluid quality that is malleable and under the control of the individual rather than fixed and defined by the parameters of the task may offer promising directions to support students with ADHD who struggle academically Such an approach is very much in line with current mindset interventions for targeting academic underachievement such as growth mindset programs Paunesku et al In this study individuals for ADHD rated the task as requiring more effort than the ADHD group The group differences in ratings of effort required and discomfort remained significant after controlling for accuracy For individuals who avoid effortful tasks there may be a unique affective association that negatively tags their experience of effort possibly impacting their motivation for future tasks Given that many theories of mental effort postulate that the experience of being mentally taxed may serve as a regulatory signal to disengage from effortful tasks g Kurzban investigating the experience of mental effort demanded during the completion of a cognitively demanding task in individuals with difficulties would provide a productive line of investigation that could be used to advance our understanding of the regulation of effort exerted in samples Author Contributions contributed to the literature review summarizing findings and writing up the manuscript JDE and MT contributed to the development of this article and

terms Francisella tularensis is able to invade survive and replicate inside a variety of cell types However in vivo F tularensis preferentially enters host macrophages where it rapidly escapes to the cytosol to avoid phagosomal stresses and to multiply to high numbers We previously showed that human monocyte infection by F tularensis LVS triggered deglycosylation of the glutamine transporter However this deglycosylation specifically induced by Francisella infection was not restricted to suggesting that host protein deglycosylation processes in general might contribute to intracellular bacterial adaptation Indeed we later found that Francisella infection modulated the transcription of numerous glycosidase and glycosyltransferase genes in human macrophages and analysis of cell extracts revealed an important increase of N and glycosylation In eukaryotic cells glycosylation has significant effects on protein folding conformation distribution stability and activity and dysfunction of protein glycosylation may lead to development of diseases like cancer and pathogenesis of infectious diseases Pathogenic bacteria have also evolved dedicated glycosylation machineries and have notably been shown to use these glycoconjugates as ligands to specifically interact with the host In this review we will focus on Francisella and summarize our current understanding of the importance of these modifications on its intracellular niche adaptation glycosylation interaction Introduction Protein glycosylation is one of the most common modifications of proteins as present in all kingdoms of life It consists in the covalent attachment of glycans onto amino acid side chains this reaction being catalyzed by an enzyme In eukaryotic cells glycosylation has significant effects on protein folding conformation distribution stability and activity Particularly the sugar chains of glycoproteins are essential for maintaining the order of intercellular interactions among all differentiated cells in multicellular organisms Therefore alterations in the sugar chains may range from being essentially undetectable to a complete loss in particular functions Indeed dysfunction of protein glycosylation may lead to development of diseases like cancer and pathogenesis of infectious diseases et al In the innate immune system which is the major actor for protection against microbial pathogens several host glycoproteins have been shown to function as pattern recognition receptors involved in pathogen binding Gioia and Zanoni glycoproteins facing the extracellular environment are ideally located to facilitate this interaction The receptors of the innate immune response i e receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain receptors are glycoproteins In the adaptative immune response the major components which include class I and class II major histocompatibility complex proteins chemokine and cytokine receptors and essentially all cytokines and chemokines are glycosylated et al Bacterial pathogens have also evolved dedicated glycosylation machineries When compared to higher organisms bacteria are capable of producing an extraordinary amount of unique and diverse glycans which are principally attached to the cell surface and secreted molecules Bacteria are able to use these glycoconjugates as a range of unique and specific ligands which specifically interact with the host and de Vos Bacteria are covered with various types of carbohydrate moieties These bacterial structures are often called molecular patterns Oligosaccharides may either mediate events or provide of biological processes For example they may allow interaction of bacterial proteins with proteins or they may modulate and or events et al All these events may be essential for bacterial colonization its survival and the subsequent infection Therefore host immunization may be dependent on these PTM whether mediated by the pathogen or by the host Francisella tularensis is a bacterium causing the zoonotic disease tularemia in a number of mammalian species including humans F tularensis invades survives and replicates inside a variety of cell types including phagocytic and cells of various species and Charbit as well as cells et al In vivo F tularensis preferentially enters host macrophages et al rapidly escapes to the cytosol where it actively multiplies et al While the cytoplasm was initially considered as a safe haven et al it is now clearly established that the host cytosol may be a harsh environment by depriving nutrients against invading bacteria Kwaik and Bumann Zhang and Rubin Conversely invading intracellular pathogens may also nutrients of the host cell that in turn needs to adapt its metabolism to control its cytosolic content et al Indeed upon addition of gluconeogenic substrates such as oaxaloacetate and pyruvate to the cell culture medium increased intracellular multiplication of F tularensis LVS was observed suggesting that these nutrients served as sources of glucose to feed multiplying bacteria We will herein summarize what is known about the processes occurring during Francisella infection as observed from either the host or the pathogen Host point of view Francisella infection modifies numerous involved in glycosylation pathways in human macrophages Indeed using a glycan processing gene microarray et al we observed significant changes in the level of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase gene expression profiles in human monocytes infected for h with F tularensis LVS et al Expression of eight genes encoding four glycosyltransferases and four glycosidases was upon infection These four glycosidase belonged to the EDEM family which is involved in degradation The expression of six genes was upon infection corresponding to five glycosyltransferases and one glycosidase The glycosyltransferases were involved either in N or in O of glycoproteins The glycosidase gene whose expression was encoded the glycosidase HEXA which is involved in the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway et al Glycosylation occurred as soon as h after entry of the bacteria into the cells Only three proteins were found and characterized as carrying potential N residues while nine proteins contained potential O residues Among them we characterized BiP protein a member of the heat shock protein family BiP expression was increased both at transcription and translation level by F tularensis LVS infection immediately after binding to the cells BiP glycosylation was also induced at early stage of infection BiP being a key regulator of the UPR et al Pfaffenbach and Lee we hypothesized that the processes could be modified by Francisella This could result in direct triggering of the UPR in infected cells with a decrease of the load of newly synthesized proteins In addition among the nine proteins containing potential residues and being glycosylated by Francisella infection we also found PRKCSH the of glucosidase This enzyme is acting upstream BiP in the calnexin pathway which is also involved in correcting misfolded proteins et al Infection of human monocytes by F tularensis LVS also triggered the deglycosylation of the glycosylated amino acid transporter and other glycoproteins et al Deglycosylation induced by F tularensis LVS was maximum at h when intracellular multiplication occurred and depended on the capacity of the bacteria to escape from the phagosomes et al It was not an inhibition of glycosylation since tunicamycine had no inhibiting effect on this deglycosylation The enzymes involved in these mechanisms are still not characterized We tried to summarize the cascade of events triggered upon infection of macrophages by Francisella in the hypothetical model depicted in Figure The transporter was chosen as a prototypic glycosylated membrane protein After its synthesis and translocation into the ER the protein is transported to the Golgi where it is first glycosylated and from there addressed to the membrane via secretory vesicles In the plasma membrane is present only as a glycosylated protein et al Upon into the cytoplasm via endocytosis glycosylated becomes available to glucosidases such as HEXA expression is induced upon Francisella The deglycosylated form of has been indeed localized only in the cytoplasm et al This deglycosylated form of the protein could trigger increase of BiP expression and its glycosylation Figure is glycosylated after passage into the Golgi and is exported to the membrane Its endocytosis into the cytoplasm renders it available to glucosidases e g HEXA whose transcription level is increased upon Francisella infection The deglycosylated form of has been indeed localized only in the cytoplasm In turn these deglycosylated possibly proteins could trigger the increase of BiP expression and its glycosylation It is tempting to suggest that the intracellular survival of Francisella would be favored both by the control exerted on the UPR response of the host and by the availability of free oligosaccharides resulting from deglycosylation processes that could serve as nutrients Pathogen point of view A large number of bacterial proteins have been found to be glycosylated et al They show a surprising degree of diversity both within and between bacterial species Protein glycosylation can be classified according to the glycosidic linkage Attachment to the amide nitrogen of asparagine is known as glycosylation with that of serine or threonine to the hydroxyl oxygen being known as glycosylation and linked glycosylation may occur either through the action of an oligosaccharyltransferase or via the action of glycosyltransferases OSTs substrates are oligosaccharides while the GTs substrates are usually sugars It was only very recently et al that the glycosylation machinery of Francisella was found to involve a variety of sugar biogenesis enzymes glycosyltransferases a flippase and a oligosaccharyltransferase As both type A and type B strains of F tularensis subspecies expressed an O protein glycosylation system which utilizes core biosynthetic and assembly pathways O protein glycosylation may be a feature common to members of the Francisella genus et al The initial attempts to elucidate the glycan repertoire of Francisella and their structures had failed because of the enzymatic and chemical release techniques used Some proteins were found after transcriptional profiling of mutants Indeed was characterized as a glycosylated Type IV pili protein which is transcriptionally regulated by MglA As MglA controls the expression of the Francisella pathogenicity island was considered as a new virulence factor et al However by mapping the glycoproteome of the strain of F tularensis subsp holarctica several candidate proteins were found that could be target for glycosylation as DsbA an uncharacterized protein FopA and LemA et al In contrast the PglA protein was identified as a targeting oligosaccharyltransferase because it is necessary for PilA glycosylation in F tularensis et al Indeed this protein undergoes multisite glycosylation with a pentasaccharide of the structure PglA is highly conserved in Francisell a genus supporting the general feature of O Then the detailed characterization of the DsbA glycan and the putative role of the gene cluster in glycan biosynthesis were reported et al Indeed these authors observed that the essential virulence factor DsbA migrated as multiple protein spots on electrophoresis gels The protein was modified with a glycan moiety in The glycan is a hexasaccharide comprised of hexoses and an unknown monosaccharide Loss of DsbA glycan modification was obtained by disruption of two genes within the putative polysaccharide locus including a galE homolog and one gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase As the mutants remained virulent in the murine model of subcutaneous tularemia it indicated that glycosylation of DsbA does not play a major role in virulence under these conditions et al When defining the previously uncharacterized protein as a novel glycosylated lipoprotein required for virulence Balonova et al also showed that the glycan structure modifying its two peptides was identical to that of DsbA glycoprotein as well as to one of the multiple glycan structures modifying the type IV pilin PilA They therefore suggested a common biosynthetic pathway for the protein modification and a relationship between synthesis of the O and the glycan in the early steps of their biosynthetic pathways Indeed the pglA gene encoding pilin oligosaccharyl transferase PglA was involved in both pilin and general F tularensis protein glycosylation In another study on activation of pulmonary inflammation after F tularensis Schu exposure et al altered expression level of mRNA transcripts was found Among these transcripts a hypothetical protein was characterized which shared homology with a glycosyl transferase This protein is part of a gene cluster which is thought to encode a polysaccharide additional to the lipopolysaccharide O antigen Another protein encoded by was found to be involved in glycoprotein synthesis and to also contribute in part to LPS capsule and or Capsule Like Complex production et al The resulting mutant presented more sensitivity to serum complement All these proteins are summarized in Table Table Genes published involved in glycosylation pathway Published Gene Gene Number Protein name Characteristics Function References Type IV pili

bglX Glycosyl hydrolase family Role of modifications on bacteria host cell proteins While of all eukaryotic proteins are estimated to be glycosylated the number of prokaryotic glycoproteins is still way behind understanding This is mainly due to the enormous variability of their glycan structures and variations in the underlying glycosylation processes In and and Messner combined glycan structural information with bioinformatic genetic biochemical and enzymatic data for analyses of glycosylation processes in prokaryotes This study included the major classes of prokaryotic e bacterial and glycoconjugates without any example on Francisella Furthermore in a very recent publication et al while F tularensis was shown to exhibit the largest number of glycoproteins in common with M tuberculosis Mtb by sharing of its glycoproteome none of the glycosylated proteins of Francisella as well as none of the enzymes involved in glycosylation pathway have been found to play a specific role in pathogenesis At the opposite in M tuberculosis glycosylation of HbN a truncated hemoglobin protein was demonstrated to be necessary for its maintainance at the bacterial membrane and wall et al Mutation in its mannose glycan linkage disrupted the facilitation of Mtb and M smegmatis entry within the macrophages These data suggested that glycosylation processes allowed Mtb survival within the hazardous environment of macrophages and the establishment of long term persistent infection in the host and Bishai Of note Francisella did not belong to the list of prokaryotes that catalyzed glycosylation of host cell proteins et al In contrast Legionella was cited as targeting through effect of the glucosyl transferase with as result the killing of eukaryotic cells et al Conclusion While examples of protein glycosylation were cited for Francisella and only for Helicobacter pylori et al the importance of these PTM observed in Francisella and those induced in the host is still largely unknown notably on the outcome of the infectious cycle Indeed a large correlation between glycosylation and bacterial pathogenicity has already been proven for various species e g Campylobacter jejuni Legionella and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli et al Francisella infection modifies the unfolded protein response et al and manipulates autophagy and Celli Both processes are involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and helping destroy invading microorganisms Glycosylation and deglycosylation could be involved in molecular mimicry of common host cell glycans therefore helping the bacteria to avoid immune recognition At this stage we have all the reasons to believe that the processes observed in cells were originated from eukaryotic enzymes However we cannot formerly exclude that Francisella enzymes might also be involved Glycans and receptors influence all stages of infection starting from initial colonization of host epithelial surfaces to spreading in tissue and inducing inflammation or injury which may results in clinical symptoms and Esko Therefore knowledge of glycosylation pathways involved during Francisella infection remains fundamental for prevention and

with these terms The majority of research in the Staphylococcus field has been dedicated to the understanding of Staphylococcus aureus infections In contrast there is limited information on infections by Staphylococci and how the host responds to them S epidermidis a member of the Staphylococci is an important commensal organism of the human skin and mucous and there is emerging evidence of its benefit for human health in fighting off harmful microorganisms However S epidermidis can cause opportunistic infections which include particularly infections on indwelling medical devices These often can disseminate into the and in fact S epidermidis is the most frequent cause of nosocomial sepsis The increasing use of medical implants and the dramatic shift in the patient demographic population in recent years have contributed significantly to the rise of S epidermidis infections Furthermore treatment has been complicated by the emergence of strains Today S epidermidis is a major nosocomial pathogen posing significant medical and economic burdens In this review we present the current understanding of mechanisms of host defense against the prototypical CoNS species S epidermidis as a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes and during infection and sepsis staphylococci Staphylococcus epidermidis innate immunity host defense sepsis biofilms infection Division of Intramural Research National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ZIA Introduction staphylococci are a heterogeneous group of staphylococcal species classified clinically by the absence of the enzyme coagulase This distinguishes them from Staphylococcus aureus and a few clinically less important species Today CoNS are the most commonly isolated bacteria in clinical cultures and have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens Risk factors for CoNS infection include the presence of indwelling medical implants such as intravascular catheters or immunosuppression due to cancer treatment or HIV AIDS Treatment of CoNS infections is complicated by the emergence of strains as particularly MRSE S epidermidis et al CoNS are an integral part of the normal flora on the human skin and mucous membranes and preferentially colonize moist areas et al S epidermidis the most common CoNS species recovered from clinical cultures colonizes the armpit groin anterior nares conjunctiva toe webs and perineal area and Musselwhite While usually innocuous or even beneficial colonizers once the host epithelial barrier is compromised CoNS such as S epidermidis can cause serious infections In fact CoNS infections account for the majority of bacterial sepsis and foreign infections with S epidermidis being the most significant species in that regard et al The host immune response to S epidermidis the mechanism of immune tolerance and the immune benefits that S epidermidis commensals can provide are just beginning to be unraveled This review will provide the latest research on the host response to S epidermidis as commensals and as opportunistic bacteria in the context of biofilm and septic infections The host immune response to S epidermidis as a commensal There is increasing evidence that the skin microbiota in general have an important impact on the immune system and Tamoutounour Despite CoNS being among the most important skin colonizers specific studies on the host immune response to CoNS colonization and establishment have been limited Those that are available have focused on the immune response to skin colonization by the prototypical CoNS species S epidermidis and the benefits such colonization provides to the host For example the Gallo group has described potentially beneficial functions of S epidermidis as a skin commensal Namely Lai et al reported that S epidermidis lipoteichoic acid through a mechanism involving TLR reduces skin inflammation et al The same authors also later reported that S epidermidis not other produces a not further characterized substance of less than kD that activates and thereby induces antimicrobial peptide production which increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit growth of group A Streptococcus and S aureus et al While these results underline a beneficial function of S epidermidis on the skin regarding the stimulating factor they have to be seen in light of the fact that the frequently reported activation of by LTA has been challenged LTA purification is extremely difficult and often contains lipopeptide contaminants including in commercial preparations et al These findings thus certainly require further assessment using isogenic mutants of S epidermidis to verify the nature of the stimulating factor Figure Model of the host response to S epidermidis colonization S epidermidis colonizes the skin epidermis a highly organized structure composed mainly of keratinocytes In response to S epidermidis colonization pattern recognition receptors such as on keratinocytes bind to poorly characterized secreted by S epidermidis to stimulate a signaling cascade that results for example in the production of the antimicrobial peptides and These antimicrobial peptides provide protection from cutaneous S aureus and Group A Streptococcus infections S epidermidis colonization induces a specific T reg response which is essential for immune tolerance toward S epidermidis as a commensal Immune tolerance is believed to be established only during the neonatal period as colonization in adult mice failed to establish tolerance In a different model based on results obtained in adult mice skin colonization by S epidermidis triggers a specific response Primed in the skin draining lymph node by dendritic cells these T cells enhance the innate antimicrobial defense and prevent invasion by the fungus C albicans Scharschmidt et al showed that colonization with S epidermidis triggered a local as well as systemic specific T cell response as demonstrated by the enrichment of specific T cells in both the lymph nodes and the spleen et al This group engineered the S epidermidis skin isolate strain to express the peptide antigen linked to a fluorescent protein To achieve colonization they applied CFUs of the engineered strain to the dorsal skin of mice every days for a total of three applications Using this model the authors illustrated that expansion of specifically regulatory T reg cells plays a critical role in the immune tolerance to S epidermidis Such tolerance however required early bacterial colonization during the neonatal stage as colonization in adult mice did not establish tolerance The work by Scharschmidt et al is especially intriguing as it provides the scientific rationale for the modulation of the skin microbiota in the neonatal period as a therapeutic option to treat inflammatory skin diseases and in particular for atopic dermatitis The skin of AD patients is often colonized by S aureus et al Several studies show that S epidermidis is the second most common microbe isolated from skin lesions et al While this does not directly implicate S epidermidis in the pathogenesis of AD due to its normal and frequent abundance on the skin in the most recent of those studies Hon et al examined bacterial isolates from AD patients and found that S epidermidis is present in the most severely skin lesions et al Thus the previously suggested antagonistic relationship between S epidermidis and S aureus et al Iwase et al did not translate to less disease in their study Rather the results suggested that S epidermidis colonization is associated with more severe AD disease Certainly further studies are required to evaluate the role of S epidermidis in AD pathogenesis and the nature of the relationship between S aureus and S epidermidis in AD lesions Naik et al demonstrated that S epidermidis colonization in adult mice induces a T cell response et al In this study the group applied ml of CFU per ml of S epidermidis across the entire mouse skin surface every other day for a total of four applications a procedure by which they reported to obtain stable colonization The T cells induced in this study however were T cells rather than T cells as in the Scharschmidt et al study et al The authors showed that these T cells provided immunity to cutaneous C albicans infection however they did not examine whether this also provides immunity to other pathogens notably S aureus et al Both the Scharschmidt et al and Naik et al studies examined the host immune response to S epidermidis colonization yet their findings are quite different These differences can be attributed to the nuances in the setup of the mouse models or possibly also the specific S epidermidis strains used Despite the differences in the results collectively the two studies showed that colonization with S epidermidis induces an adaptive T cell response in mice It is unclear however if such immune signature to S epidermidis colonization is also observed in humans Immunity against S epidermidis in infections Very few studies have been performed to assess the immune response to CoNS infections especially as compared to S aureus Most of those studies have focused on S epidermidis CoNS infections often occur in patients with medical implants with S epidermidis being the most likely species to be recovered et al Biofilms are complex spatially diverse agglomerations of bacterial cells enclosed within an amorphous extracellular matrix composed of extracellular DNA proteins and polysaccharides infections are extremely resistant to antibiotic treatment for several reasons including reduced metabolism and hampered penetration through the extracellular matrix and O Toole Consequently treatment often requires surgical removal of the infected device or tissue In the US alone approximately billion is spent annually for the treatment and management of orthopedic infections Parvizi et al In general the host immune response to an S epidermidis infection is not protective or sufficient to clear the infection Hence most S epidermidis infections are chronic Most studies conducted on the subject thus far are studies that have compared versus planktonic bacteria Results from several studies suggest that S epidermidis biofilms induce attenuation in phagocytic function and production of cytokines when compared to their planktonic counterparts Conflicting findings have been reported on the effects of S epidermidis biofilms on phagocytic activity Two studies reported that adherence and phagocytosis by human neutrophils and primary human macrophages were significantly enhanced when stimulated with bacteria et al Spiliopoulou et al while others reported that the biofilm exopolysaccharide polysaccharide intercellular adhesin et al plays an essential role in the attenuation of phagocytic capacity of murine peritoneal macrophages and Wu murine macrophages et al and human PMNs There is consensus in the literature however with regard to the effects of S epidermidis biofilm on phagocytic killing Killing by human macrophages et al and PMNs et al Kristian et al as well as killing by leukocytes et al are strongly attenuated in the presence of bacteria Figure Model of the host response to S epidermidis infections Breaching through the skin can result in S epidermidis dissemination into the bloodstream to cause bacteremia and acute cases of sepsis Host immunity against septic infections heavily depends on neutrophils complement as well as activation of PRRs including coupled receptors such as and infections on medical implants originate from contaminations during device insertion or in rare cases from the bloodstream Patients with medical implants are susceptible to S epidermidis sepsis as biofilm bacteria can often disseminate into the bloodstream The immune response to infections is generally thought to be not effective as biofilms inhibit phagocytic killing by PMNs and macrophages In addition they skew the immune system toward enhanced production of cytokines such as while limiting the secretion of cytokines including and The role of complement in CoNS infections is quite unclear While S epidermidis strains elicit a stronger response in the activation and release of complement components than their isogenic and thus counterparts et al Fredheim et al such complement release did not translate to enhanced phagocytic killing S epidermidis biofilms triggered release but protected S epidermidis from and IgG opsonization and killing et al some authors tried to attribute specific effects to PIA rather than biofilm formation by mechanically destroying aggregates et al in none of these studies a clear distinction between the effects of biofilm agglomerations and a direct effect of the exopolysaccharide PIA can be made As for the claimed properties of PIA et al Fredheim et al Ferreirinha et al the facts that PIA is a substance and isogenic mutants have distinctly different cell surface properties makes it difficult to attribute observed effects directly to the PIA molecule It has been reported that S epidermidis strains elicit production of rather than cytokines et al In the respective study primary human macrophages stimulated with live S epidermidis from biofilms produced lower levels of cytokines and elevated levels of the cytokine than planktonic cells grown for h Obviously in that comparison other factors such as most notably factors such as the modulins et al discussed below may be made responsible for the observed differences rather than biofilm formation itself However comparing with isogenic Embp or strains Schommer et al also observed a reduced inflammatory response in macrophages with reduced activation and reduced production et al Little is known about how the adaptive immune system responds to infections in part because it is difficult to establish S epidermidis biofilm infection models Vuong et al have developed a murine infection model with a S epidermidis bioluminescent strain called SE with which they were able to monitor in the progression of S epidermidis infection et al Comparing the susceptibility of Nu Nu and B to S epidermidis infection with Balb C mice the authors found that in particular the Nu Nu mice were more susceptible to infection indicating an important role of T immunity against S epidermidis infection Immunity against S epidermidis during sepsis The presence of CoNS in the blood often originating from the dispersal of bacteria from biofilms on indwelling medical devices can cause acute sepsis CoNS bacteremia is associated with significant healthcare costs morbidity and mortality and Wenzel and premature neonates are the most vulnerable to CoNS sepsis with S epidermidis being the most prevalent CoNS species involved and Otto In contrast to S epidermidis infections which are chronic S epidermidis sepsis is acute by nature Therefore the host immune response to S epidermidis sepsis which takes place largely in the bloodstream is quite different from that against S epidermidis biofilm Since neonates have increased susceptibility to S epidermidis sepsis most of the studies on the matter dealt with S epidermidis neonatal sepsis Therefore the following discussion will be focused on neonatal immunity in response to S epidermidis sepsis An important element in the innate immune response are innate immune cells among which neutrophils dominate in number Neutrophils recognize invading microbes via a repertoire of host receptors ingest them and eliminate them within the phagosome by reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial proteins released during a process called degranulation et al In addition lysed neutrophils can form neutrophil extracellular traps to bind and kill invading microbes et al Several pattern recognition receptors which recognize and bind to conserved microbial products molecular and play an essential role in the activation of the innate immune response have been shown to be critical in host immunity against S epidermidis sepsis was shown to be critical for clearance of S epidermidis in a mouse sepsis model et al In human neonates there is an increase in expression over the course of S epidermidis sepsis et al however a immune system was reported to be less proficient in eliciting multiple cytokine responses in neonates compared to adults et al S epidermidis PIA et al PSMs et al and lipoteichoic acid et al have been claimed to be effectors of However studies with PIA and PSMs were not verified with isogenic and as for LTA there has been recent evidence indicating that staphylococcal lipopeptides rather than LTA are the real agents et al Furthermore in S aureus it was shown that PSMs are not direct agonists of but lead to the release of lipopeptides from the cell surface and thus have a secondary effect et al an effect likely also present in S epidermidis Based on the fact that the formyl peptide receptor recognizes PSMs et al this G chemoattractant receptor is another potentially important host receptor in the response against S epidermidis As shown in S aureus activation induces chemotaxis granule exocytosis and release from PMNs et al Kretschmer et al Studies on the effects of PSMs of CoNS on the immune response have only been performed with pure PSMs of S epidermidis et al and so far have been hampered by the multitude of genetic psm loci in S epidermidis and the general difficulty to produce isogenic deletion mutants in CoNS However a recent study attributed a crucial role to the mobile highly produced of S epidermidis in inflammation and immune evasion using isogenic mutants et al Complement also plays an important role in the immunity against S epidermidis sepsis Deficiencies in complement factor and IgG are associated with a higher risk of neonatal sepsis et al Furthermore in a study using an sepsis model S epidermidis induced significantly lower complement activation in neonatal compared to adult blood et al This finding suggests that there is a maturational deficiency in the neonatal complement system which in part may explain why neonates are more susceptible to S epidermidis septic infections than adults Moreover this study highlights the importance of the complement system in the host defense against S epidermidis sepsis Like complement neutrophils of preterm neonates display maturational deficiency They show an impaired oxidative burst compared to those isolated from term newborns when stimulated with S epidermidis et al This in part may also explain the increased susceptibility in preterm neonates to S epidermidis sepsis Interestingly enough monocytes another cellular component in the innate immune response are not essential to the host defense against neonatal S epidermidis sepsis as both human neonatal and adult monocytes displayed similar phagocytic and intracellular killing capacity et al Taken together this indicates that neutrophils play a particularly important role in the immune response during S epidermidis sepsis While there are numerous studies dedicated to understanding the role of the innate immune response during S epidermidis sepsis research on the role of the adaptive immune response in S epidermidis septic infections remains limited As these infections are acute in nature it is unlikely that the adaptive immune response plays a significant role Accordingly intravenous transfer of immunoglobulin from donors with high titers of antibodies to S epidermidis or S aureus failed to protect from sepsis in preterm newborns et al DeJonge et al Conclusions CoNS infections and in particular S epidermidis pose a significant medical and economic burden to public healthcare Furthermore with the emergence of antibiotic resistance treatment options are becoming limited However the elimination of S epidermidis bacteria appears inappropriate as they are an integral part of the beneficial microbiota on the skin and mucous membranes The beneficial role of S epidermidis colonization in the prevention of pathogen overgrowth on the skin based on results in mice has been attributed to stimulation of the immune response However with the mouse skin model barely reflecting the situation on human skin it remains poorly understood whether the findings are transferable to humans Furthermore whether there is a role of potential direct bacterial interaction between S epidermidis and pathogens on the skin remains to be investigated The immune response to S epidermidis during infection possibly is even less well understood In chronic infection it is difficult to distinguish between effects of shear agglomeration and those mediated by specific cell surface components During sepsis the nature and role of cytokines and inflammation pathways in response to S epidermidis remains equally poorly defined Elucidation of these mechanisms will also provide more information on the question why neonates are particularly susceptible to S epidermidis infection Progress that has been made regarding molecular biology tools for S epidermidis and CoNS in general will be of great help in these endeavors and especially assist in differentiating between direct and secondary effects Clearly a deeper understanding of the host immune response to these infections will be critical to the development of S epidermidis vaccines and novel therapies Author contributions TN and MO wrote the manuscript MP and TN prepared figures Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was

primarily associated with asbestos exposure Early detection of MPM is restricted by the long latency period until clinical presentation the ineffectiveness of imaging techniques in early stage detection and the lack of biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity In this study we used transcriptome data mining in order to determine which CLAUDIN genes are differentially expressed in MPM as compared to controls Using the same approach we identified the interactome of the differentially expressed CLDN genes and assessed their expression profile Subsequently we evaluated the effect of tumor histology asbestos exposure deletion status and gender on the gene expression level of the claudin interactome We found that out of studied CLDNs and out of available interactors SHBG were differentially expressed in MPM specimens vs healthy tissues The genes encoding the and proteins present differences in their expression profile between the three histological subtypes of MPM Moreover is significantly in the cohort of patients with previous history of asbestos exposure was also found significantly underexpressed in patients lacking the gene These results warrant the detailed in vitro investigation of the role of in the pathobiology of MPM asbestos claudins interactome malignant mesothelioma pleura tight junctions transcriptome Introduction Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumor primarily associated with exposure to asbestos Due to the prolonged latent period between asbestos exposure and clinical presentation of the disease the incidence of MPM has continued to rise across Europe even after the imposed restrictions on asbestos use et al Worldwide the incidence of MPM is increasing and it is expected to peak in the years and Lake MPM diagnosis and treatment is challenging therefore current research efforts are focused in biomarker discovery that would aid its early diagnosis prognosis and therapeutic outcome prediction et al Transcriptome studies combined with data mining techniques have provided new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and have led to the identification of new candidate biomarkers with potential clinical value et al Claudins represent a family of tetraspan transmembrane proteins that contribute to the formation and the proper function of tight junctions and Morin They regulate the paracellular transport of ions and molecules in a size and charge sensitive manner et al A notable feature of claudins is that some members increase the paracellular permeability while others decrease it More specifically and increase the paracellular cation permeability in the Tight Junctions whereas and have a sealing function et al Milatz et al Soini In addition to their contribution to the establishment of cellular polarity the TJ proteins also participate in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation et al and Morin Soini The pleural mesothelial cells form a monolayer that expresses claudins in their TJs although their exact role in the pleural physiology and pathophysiology is scarcely investigated et al Currently it is known that mesothelial TJ claudins contribute to the pleural membrane permeability while during inflammation the expression levels of claudins change leading to increased pleural permeability et al Markov and Amasheh These data highlight the role of claudins and TJ related proteins in the context of pleural physiology and pathophysiology Several studies have highlighted the role of claudins in cancer since in several malignancies kidney breast stomach instestine pancreas and their expression is deregulated et al Furthermore accumulating data suggest roles for claudins in tumor development and progression as well as in signal transduction while in several cancers expression of claudins is associated with prognosis et al Claudins have also been studied in the context of MPM by means of immunohistochemistry et al et al In this aspect several changes in the expression of claudins have been documented and Ahmed Soini Most studies so far have focused on the diagnostic value of claudins notably claudins in distinguishing MPM from other carcinomas has been shown to be highly effective in the differential diagnosis between MPM and metastatic carcinomas et al b Ohta et al Jo et al However at the transcriptional level there is scarcity of information regarding the differential gene expression of claudins between healthy and MPM samples In this study we applied data mining and transcriptomic analysis in order to determine the CLAUDIN CLDN genes that are differentially expressed in MPM specimens as compared to healthy controls Using the same approach we also probed for CLDN interactors and assessed their expression patterns so as to identify novel genes interacting with CLDNs that may contribute to the pathophysiology of MPM Finally we evaluated the effect of MPM histology asbestos exposure deletion status and gender on the gene expression level of the claudin interactome Materials and methods Identification of the differential gene expression profile of CLDNs in microarray data from MPM and control counterparts We used gene expression data from an MPM study included in the Oncomine Research Premium Edition Cancer Microarray database http www oncomine org in order to investigate the gene expression profile of CLDNs et al GEO Profiles GDS We analyzed data for the CLDN genes that were assessed in this study in order to detect their potential differential expression in MPM specimens as compared to healthy ones The genes that were not assessed in GDS were CLDNs In order to ensure that the data were generated with the same methodology we selected gene expression data from a single study study that from this point on will be referred as Gordon Mesothelioma study throughout the In this study the Affymetrix Human Genome array was used assessing genes The raw data were downloaded from Oncomine in Excel format and were scrutinized selecting only the ones referring to surgically excised samples excluding the ones referring to mesothelial and MPM cell lines Finally in this study there were n MPM cases and n controls n pleura and n lung The gene expression data were log transformed median centered per array and the standard deviation was normalized to one per array as described previously et al All values from the transformed data were downloaded from Oncomine during March Identification of the interactome of the differentially expressed claudins The gene interaction network of the significantly differentially expressed CLDNs in MPM patients was constructed using http thebiogrid org ConsensusPathDB http cpdb molgen mpg de and String http org databases The database is a repository of genetic and interactions that are curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major model organism species et al The ConsensusPathDB database integrates interaction networks including binary and complex genetic metabolic signaling gene regulatory and interactions as well as biochemical pathways et al String is a database of known and predicted protein interactions including both direct and indirect associations et al After querying for each differentially expressed CLDN in the above databases we superimposed the results in order to remove duplicate or triplicate genes and created a list of unique genes List that comprised the interactome of the significantly and expressed CLDNs in MPM patients from the Gordon Mesothelioma study The members of List are shown in Table where their name along with their description is provided based on GeneCards query that was performed GeneCards http www genecards org is an integrated

for those genes that were found to be or in the samples of MPM patients in the Gordon Mesothelioma study All values from the transformed data were downloaded from Oncomine during March following the same procedures as in the case of the Gordon Mesothelioma study The levels of gene expression were subsequently arranged into strata with respect to asbestos exposure history deletion status no and

concerning the effects of asbestos exposure Regarding deletion status homozygous deletion was present in patients in patients it was not present while in patients the information was not available

Discussion MPM is a highly aggressive tumor arising from the mesothelial cells that line the pleural cavity et al Due to the established cause and effect relationship between asbestos exposure and MPM development researchers seek to identify suitable biomarkers for screening asbestos exposed populations and for early diagnosis while avoiding false positive results and unnecessary invasive procedures et al Although several studies have pointed to the effectiveness of soluble mesothelin as a biomarker with high specificity its limited sensitivity confines its use as a screening tool for the asymptomatic cohorts et al Thus at the present time there are no biomarkers in widespread clinical use for MPM et al Transcript profiling along with new and bioinformatics have been extensively used in the field of personalized medicine enabling researchers to identify biomarkers for cancer screening diagnosis and prognosis et al In this study we used established data mining techniques through which we have already reported and to be ideal candidates for further study in MPM pathophysiology et al Tasiopoulou et al Vavougios et al Claudins are structural molecules of TJs present in epithelial endothelial and mesothelial cells et al Soini The patterns of claudin expression within TJs are distinctly diverse among different tissues accounting for the observed differences in permeability and electrical resistance of various epithelia et al Markov et al It should be noted that not only the expression of claudin family members but also their localization within cells may vary et al Dittmann et al The latter might be affected by several exogenous factors such as food components plant compounds and microbial toxins et al Markov et al Differential gene expression of claudins has been reported in several tumors depending on the exact claudin and cancer studied et al Chao et al and Morin et al Valle and Morin Davidson Soini Here we report that is significantly in MPM patients as compared to controls while CLDNs and are significantly An in vitro study using and cell lines et al has shown by means of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting a high level of claudin in both cell lines as opposed to claudins and An earlier study demonstrated by means of immunohistochemistry that in MPM there was a lower expression of and than in metastatic adenocarcinomas of the pleura suggesting that they could serve as differential diagnostic markers et al In the same report PMCs showed expression of claudin but no expression was found for and Two more studies assessing the expression of in a large series of normal and MPM tissues by immunohistochemistry reported that is a definitive negative marker for MPM which is in agreement with our data showing the significant of in MPM as opposed to controls et al b This finding has been consistently shown in other studies as well et al Jo et al Finally one more study has demonstrated that the gene expression of and was significantly lower in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma as compared to ovarian carcinomas et al In our study we also demonstrate that the gene is significantly in the epithelioid histological subtype of MPM as compared to the sarcomatoid and biphasic phenotypes Similar results were shown in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma at the protein level et al On the contrary we observed that the gene expression of is significantly increased in sarcomatoid MPM as compared to epithelioid MPM has been reported as a useful biomarker in assessing tumor load stage and prognosis for patients with malignant melanoma et al It has been suggested that the differences in the molecular biology of epithelioid and MPM may contribute to differences in their clinical behavior et al The epithelioid cell type is among the factors that favor the overall survival of MPM patients et al Musk et al Linton et al As a consequence it has been proposed that the diagnosis of the sarcomatoid variant on a biopsy should preclude radical surgery and therapy should aim at symptoms management and preservation of quality of life et al Therefore the clear distinction of histological subtypes could direct clinicians to the appropriate treatment options In the literature it is supported that the current golden standard for MPM diagnosis is a combination of two positive and two negative immunohistochemical markers in the epithelioid and biphasic type but sarcomatous type do not have specific markers making diagnosis more difficult et al Here we propose that and could serve as complementary diagnostic tools and should be further investigated Next we observed that was in patients lacking the gene Moreover the gene was significantly in MPM patients with previous history of asbestos exposure compared to the unexposed ones is the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor gene in human MPM The inactivation of both and Arf products of the gene has been suggested to act synergistically in accelerating tumorigenesis in vivo Development of MPM is strongly associated with asbestos exposure with of the patients having previous exposure to asbestos fibers and Lake Nakano Sekido A significant association has been described between increasing number of methylated cell cycle control genes and asbestos burden This finding was followed by the observation that quantitative measure of asbestos exposure was associated with over discrete CpG loci and that in of cases there was increased methylation associated with increased exposure and Marsit The correlation between methylation status and extended exposure to asbestos was also confirmed by Fujii et al Likewise the results of this study are indicative of the epigenetic effect of asbestos in the transcriptional level of the gene suggesting its potential utility as a screening biomarker for populations at risk Although in our analysis with respect to gender the gene expression of SHBG and was not different between sexes we observed that the SHBG gene which encodes the Sex Globulin was in MPM patients as compared to healthy controls SHBG is a major regulator of free plasma androgens and also mediates androgen and estrogen signaling at the cell membrane via cyclic adenosine monophosphate and Schleutker It is generally accepted that although MPM is less common in women compared to men female MPM patients survive longer et al Musk et al Linton et al Taioli et al It has been proposed that differences in asbestos exposure tumor biology and the impact of circulating hormones on host response must be investigated to understand this survival advantage and improve prognosis for patients of both genders et al The observed of the SHBG gene in the group of MPM patients relative to the control group advocates the role of sex hormones in the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease This is stressed out by a study showing that estrogen receptor beta acts as a tumor suppressor of high potential relevance to prediction of disease progression and to therapeutic response in MPM patients et al As in the case of SHBG the genes encoding and were found significantly in MPM specimens as compared to their healthy counterparts The protein product of interacts with its target proteins within cells to regulate enzyme activities cell growth differentiation and Ca homeostasis et al It is thought that expression levels of individual family proteins vary considerably in different tumors and with respect to cancer progression and Einarsson or is a proinflammatory chemokine involved in the promotion of neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation and Wilson It has been demonstrated that many types of human carcinomas express high levels of relative to normal tissues et al In addition high serum levels of this chemokine correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis while a link exists between tumor transition and tumor stemness et al Gales et al In this study gene was found in the group of MPM patients compared to the control group It has been demonstrated that neutrophil infiltration into the pleural space is a characteristic feature of an early and acute inflammatory response in several pleural diseases and that activated PMCs secrete in a polarized fashion et al Inhibition of has been shown to reduce human MPM propagation in a nude mouse model et al Asbestos directly stimulate PMCs to synthesize possibly playing an important role in mediating asbestos induced pleural inflammation and Antony Mutsaers et al Further studies are warranted to compare expression and features of EMT at various stages of tumor development et al Vascular endothelial cadherin an endothelial specific adhesion molecule plays a pivotal role in the formation maturation and remodeling of the vascular wall It has been shown that directly enhances the expression level of by tethering repressive transcription factors away from the CLDN promoter Conversely the absence of functional is associated with loss of expression et al Gavard These results suggest that any changes in will impact the endothelial barrier function at multiple levels and also explain why inhibition may cause a marked increase in permeability and Gutkind Taddei et al Increased permeability is an early step in the angiogenic process enabling endothelial migration out of the primary vessel in order to begin formation of the tumor neovasculature Guelte et al On the other hand it has been demonstrated that induction of during EMT promotes breast cancer progression via signaling indicating that in certain tumor cells can induce cellular responses that are in contrast to its role in contact growth inhibition in endothelial cells et al Thus there are two distinct functions of both in angiogenesis and progression of cancer et al Regarding thoracic tumors in particular it has been reported that may be an interesting marker for analysis in therapeutic trials although results from clinical studies are pending et al An important limitation of our findings is the lack of information regarding the asbestos exposure history of the MPM patients of the Gordon Mesothelioma study If these data were available we could assess asbestos induced gene expression changes between MPM patients and controls Our results require further investigation in the clinical setting with the inclusion of a large series of MPM patients vs healthy asbestos exposed individuals serving as controls Moreover detailed information regarding the duration of asbestos exposure and the type of exposure should also be incorporated in future research Conclusions The results of this study are suggestive of a distinct gene expression profile of the claudin interactome in MPM and underline the epigenetic effect of asbestos on the transcriptional level of the gene The role of and in pleural physiology and pathophysiology is unknown and requires in depth investigation at the functional level Additionally both and should be further investigated as gene biomarkers in MPM with respect to their potential to discriminate the histological MPM subgroups at the molecular level and thus provide tools for personalized

emerged as a major theme in microbiology and infectious disease Reactive fluorescent dyes have the potential to advance the study of ROS in the complex intracellular environment especially for and analyses However current approaches to measuring intracellular ROS have the potential for significant artifacts Here we describe a robust platform for flow cytometric quantification of ROS in bacteria using fluorescent dyes with ROS measurements in of individual cells under a variety of conditions False positives and variability among sample types g bacterial species stress are reduced with a flexible gating scheme that accounts for and light background fluorescence DNA content and dye uptake to identify cells producing ROS Using CellROX Green dye with Escherichia coli Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG as diverse model bacteria we show that the generation of a quantifiable CellROX Green signal for superoxide but not hydrogen hydroxyl radicals validates this dye as a superoxide the level of superoxide does not correlate with cytotoxicity or antibiotic the antibiotic tolerant state of mycobacteria is associated with high levels of and production of superoxide is idiosyncratic with regard to both the species and the physiological state of the bacteria We also show that the gating method is applicable to other fluorescent indicator dyes such as the diacetate acetoxymethyl ester and tetrazolium chloride for cellular esterase and reductive respiratory activities respectively These results demonstrate that properly controlled flow cytometry coupled with fluorescent probes provides precise and accurate quantitative analysis of ROS generation and metabolic changes in stressed bacteria reactive oxygen species flow cytometry bacteria oxidative stress starvation antibiotics Alliance for Research and Technology Centre Introduction Reactive oxygen species have been proposed to play critical roles in microbial metabolism Imlay and response to environmental stressors such as antibiotic exposure Brynildsen et al Zhao and Drlica Though are often viewed as a single agent the widely differing chemistry of specific types of ROS critically determines their function in microbes Among the biologically relevant ROS superoxide is a relatively unreactive species arising from electron transport processes and cytochrome activity and is detoxified by superoxide dismutases to the relatively inert hydrogen peroxide O Hassan and Fridovich Iyanagi Dedon and Tannenbaum Reduction of H O by metals g Fe Fe and Cu Cu in Fenton yields highly reactive hydroxyl radicals Imlay et al Imlay Bataineh et al Though less abundant in bacteria another source of hydroxyl radicals involves homolytic scission of peroxynitrite t arising from the reaction of nitric oxide and O Dedon and Tannenbaum The recent emergence of fluorescent probes to detect ROS builds on the use of fluorescent dyes to study bacterial components such as nucleic acid abundance or dehydrogenase activity Walberg et al et al In bacteria fluorescent probes have been most widely used in attempts to define the role of ROS production in response to antibiotic exposures Albesa et al Goswami et al Kohanski et al Wang et al Dwyer et al A variety of fluorescent ROS probes are now available with each probe claiming to possess different reactivity stability fluorescence and membrane transport properties Kalyanaraman et al Imlay However the efficiency and specificity of different dyes for detecting different ROS in vivo have rarely been established with any confidence Kalyanaraman et al much less across a range of different bacteria Among other dyes bacterial ROS have often been studied using p fluorescein Kohanski et al Dwyer et al and or diacetate Roca and Ramakrishnan Dwyer et al The latter is prone to signal artifacts due to erroneous amplification of the fluorescence intensity by a mechanism involving an intermediate radical Kalyanaraman et al This problem has led several groups to use HPF for ROS analysis in bacteria Kohanski et al Nguyen et al Dwyer et al Grant et al but HPF almost exclusively detects such as hydroxyl radical and hypochlorous acid Setsukinai et al While there is emerging evidence for involvement of ROS in stress in a limited range of model bacteria mainly Escherichia coli recent studies have challenged the generality of ROS production on the basis of the low dynamic range of HPF Renggli et al and problems with spurious fluorescent signals and other artifacts Keren et al Liu and Imlay Renggli et al Paulander et al There are other factors that complicate the use of dyes Among these are the uptake and removal of both unreacted and dye molecules from the cells by efflux pumps increased membrane permeability caused by cellular stress Renggli et al as well as poorly defined bacterial metabolic states at the time of the stress and dye staining For example while E coli does not possess cytochrome mycobacteria have dozens McLean et al Ouellet et al with as sources of O Munro et al The difficulty of measuring ROS coupled with these idiosyncratic factors in individual bacteria and across different bacterial species have hindered a broader examination of cell state as a factor in ROS generation and its role in the decision between cell death and survival To overcome these problems we developed a robust platform for flow cytometric detection of ROS in bacteria using a stable fluorescent dye This standardized approach employs a gating scheme to account for and light DNA content and dye uptake to accurately identify and quantify cells The method accounts for autofluorescence arising from changes in cell morphology membrane composition and protein expression during normal cell growth and the cellular response to stresses such as antibiotic treatment and starvation Kim et al Renggli et al Paulander et al We piloted this method with CellROX Green dye to assess its activity in living bacteria and to assess claims Choi et al that CellROX Green is selective for O in bacterial cells There are many methods for detecting O including electrochemistry spectroscopy chemiluminescence and vibrational spectroscopy Hayyan et al though intracellular O has traditionally been quantified by extracellular reduction of ferricytochrome c or by electron with spin trapping by N Frejaville et al Huycke et al Korshunov and Imlay Neither of these bulk measurements provide resolution of endogenous O in bacterial populations Though new probes specific to O and suitable for direct in vivo studies have been developed in recent years they have not been evaluated in bacteria Mukhopadhyay et al Hu et al Shin et al Here we applied our flow cytometric method with CellROX Green to quantify O production in three diverse but model bacteria E coli and the mycobacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis bacille all subjected to the stresses of antibiotic exposure and nutrient depletion We found that changes in O production across isogenic bacterial populations are heterogeneous and highly dependent upon the nature of the stress and the physiological state of the cells We also demonstrate the utility of the method for two other fluorescent dyes diacetate acetoxymethyl ester for esterase activity Schreer et al and tetrazolium chloride for cellular respiratory activity Rodriguez et al Materials and Methods Bacteria Strains and Culture Mycobacterium smegmatis mc was plated on agar supplemented with Middlebrook Oleic Albumin Dextrose Catalase growth supplement and glycerol After picking three separate colonies the mycobacterial strain was grown in mL of media supplemented with albumin D supplement glycerol Tween at in a shaker M smegmatis was passaged twice before treatment of growing cells M bovis bacille Calmette Pasteur strain was cultured from isogenic freezer stocks in mL conical tubes then passaged into roller bottles with supplemented media Chionh et al For e cultures M smegmatis and BCG were grown to OD washed twice in PBS mM NaCl mM KCl mM NaH PO mM KH PO pH and to an OD or M smegmatis in PBS plus Tyloxapol detergent to prevent in roller bottles CFUs for BCG were determined from serial dilution plating on at for days Single colonies of E coli or were grown overnight in LB broth diluted in fresh LB as a subculture and grown to OD to use in studies CFUs for E coli and M smegmatis was determined from serial dilution plating on LB incubated overnight E coli or days M smegmatis at mutants for sodA and sodB in the E coli background were obtained from the E coli Keio Knockout Collection Antibiotic and Toxicant Exposures Antibiotics were subjected to twofold serial dilutions in media or PBS in plates containing per well For H O and menadione treatments reagents were added to each well of a plate at concentrations twofold higher than the final exposure condition Bacterial cultures were diluted to an OD M smegmatis and E coli or and was added to each well containing antibiotic H O menadione media or PBS for a total treatment volume of The plates were incubated for indicated times at For menadione and H O treatments cultures were washed once and resuspended in PBS while cells were diluted in fresh media without washing For the PBS versus LB uL of culture was transferred directly into either uL of PBS or PBS LB in the presence of uM CellROX After min cells were fixed by the addition of paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry M smegmatis were generated by diluting growing cells to OD and aliquoting to individual wells containing an antibiotic at a range of concentrations in a plate Cultures were covered and incubated at with humidity for or days prior to analysis Flow Cytometry and

unstained samples for the bacterial population by correlates with cell and correlates with cell internal of light and to determine background fluorescence Single cells were used to gate the population while single CellROX or cells were used to determine the population The stains were also used for compensation as needed between the dye signals A Biotek Synergy microplate reader was used for fluorescence measurements with excitation of CellROX Green using a nm filter and emission captured at nm Statistical analyses were performed with Prism GraphPad Software Results Design Criteria for an Method for Quantification of Bacterial ROS Using Fluorescent Dyes The availability of fluorescent dyes for the detection and quantification of reactive chemical species in cells has fostered the development of analyses in microbiology and antibiotic pharmacology including both population assays and flow cytometry assays However factors such as dye uptake efficiency dye efflux changes in cell morphology and background fluorescence complicate the application of these fluorescent assays to bacteria and confound the interpretation of observed changes in fluorescence To achieve assay precision and accuracy and ensure credible and biologically meaningful results we developed a gating scheme Figures B to select for particle size based on FSC and SSC as light passes through the cells DNA content based on DAPI staining other the presence of dye based on fluorescence above unstained and particles and dye reactivity above baseline or basal fluorescence Application of this flow cytometry method distinguishes bacteria from debris by selecting for size and DNA content which also distinguishes single cells from dividing cells and individual bacterial species in mixed cultures Additionally greater sensitivity and specificity for ROS and metabolic activity is achieved by removing contributions from autofluorescence and by selecting only cells that have taken up the dye with of those cells for highly fluorescent activated dye Here we illustrate this scheme with CellROX hi gating for endogenous ROS quantification Figure and then demonstrate the versatility of the assay with examples using CTC and CFDA dyes for cellular metabolism Figures D FIGURE Optimization of gating and other flow cytometric parameters minimizes artifacts in reactive oxygen species detection with fluorescent probes in bacteria Workflow diagram summarizing the flow cytometry gating strategy Step selects for and particles Step excludes particles that do not contain DNA Step accounts for background fluorescence by eliminating cells that did not take up the dye and cells with autofluorescence Step quantifies dye activation The gating process and rationale is further elaborated in Section and Discussion Representative contour plots of the gating scheme of Mycobacterium smegmatis stained with DAPI and the dye CellROX Green Cells are sequentially selected for FSC and SSC Size

Escherichia coli and M smegmatis E coli cultures were treated with mL ampicillin for h and M smegmatis with mL ethambutol for h Histograms of E coli and M smegmatis demonstrating increased background fluorescence in dead bacteria PFA fixed in comparison to live bacteria in the CellROX Green detection channel A Gating Scheme for the Accurate Quantification of ROS Levels in Bacteria Step in the analysis scheme Figures B defines the bacterial population of interest based on FSC and SSC properties In addition Step gating can be adjusted for populations in which a significant portion exhibits changes in cell morphology By considering increases in fluorescence observed in cells with elevated SSC or FSC which can be performed by gating such as SSC versus fluorescence these cells can be selected for analysis if they pass the subsequent gates for background fluorescence be considered Dye and then for desired activation of the fluorescent dye Each bacterial cell has morphological and biological properties that may be uniquely altered in response to stress or as part of its life cycle Gating e SSC and FSC in Step allows consistent selection for cell size shape complexity and composition For example during logarithmic growth SSC and FSC profiles of filamentous E coli differ from those of M smegmatis bacilli Figure Overall both bacilli and filamentous bacteria have higher FSC signals during cell division At the same time population heterogeneity in cell size or length and cellular macromolecular composition can be detected by FSC and SSC respectively For M smegmatis heterogeneity is likely due to bacterial replication on the basis of time rather than cell size Aldridge et al Depending upon cytometer settings bacteria passing through the light source at different angles will be detected as lower or higher FSC SSC signals than those observed for uniform spheres Additionally stresses such as antibiotic exposures can alter cell light scatter by inhibiting replication or altering cell morphology such as by causing filamentation or by inhibiting septation Figure Renggli et al Paulander et al et al These differences in morphology and composition detected by FSC and SSC should be considered when interpreting bacterial populations during an analysis since these changes can significantly alter the observed fluorescence Step ensures that only cells with intact DNA are included in the analysis Small particles such as cell debris and dust particles also generate FSC and SSC signals Therefore DNA content staining is used to differentiate bacteria from particles This staining step further enables the assessment of several biologically relevant parameters including detection of doubling cells cell aggregates and dead cells with fragmented DNA et al The gating also excludes artifacts from the analysis which may arise from an abundance of dead cell debris in studies of bacterial persistence and dormancy as pursued here with M smegmatis For example subsequent experiments in Figures show that of the mycobacteria were killed by antibiotics before a population was established with the debris potentially confounding flow cytometry analysis Step accounts for background fluorescence and helps to distinguish cells that take up dye molecules from those that do not thus increasing the accuracy and rigor of the ROS analysis Here the relatively weak but detectable fluorescence of unactivated dye is exploited to select all presumptive cells by virtue of their fluorescence above that of unstained cells This fluorescence of unactivated CellROX Green is apparent as a increase in fluorescence in PBS solutions above the PBS background versus f u under conditions used in the flow and by a increase in fluorescence when CellROX Green is added to or cells upon fluorimeter settings and cell It is important to note that flow cytometry cannot be used to accurately attribute the source of increased fluorescence unstained to specific changes in cellular morphology composition and metabolism ROS generation or increased dye uptake However using this gate for dye uptake increases the accuracy for events in the assay In the absence of this step all cells from Steps and will be analyzed regardless of dye uptake status Only after gating for size DNA and dye presence is it possible to accurately identify cells in which ROS has potentially activated the dye molecules to fluoresce above background levels and to quantify the fluorescence intensities of these cells It is important to point out that Step also accounts for changes in background fluorescence from a variety of sources For example in our hands the exponential growth in the presence of LB or cell culture medium during staining of E coli and M smegmatis respectively increased background signals by up to Increases in fluorescence were also observed in and bacteria Figure As dead cells do not have metabolic processes such fluorescence increases indicate that ungated fluorescent signals cannot be entirely attributed to the presence of ROS In these cases variation in the background fluorescence makes it difficult to determine whether the summed fluorescence increment above that observed in unstained cells is due to activated dye that reacted with ROS produced in metabolically active cells by unreacted dye taken up by cells or by fluorescent intracellular compounds such as flavins Benson et al The Dye gating in Step minimizes this issue by cells that possess fluorescence greater than unstained cells which includes cells that have internalized dye molecules regardless of their activation state In Step the degree of dye activation presumably by ROS is quantified here as hi Step selects for cells with fluorescence above untreated or control levels with those with higher levels of fluorescence hi are deemed to contain elevated levels of the chemicals presumably the identity of the reactive chemicals as specific forms of ROS must be defined by appropriate control experiments or fixed cells that take up dye but do not produce ROS or other reactive chemicals are used as gating controls to set the threshold for CellROX hi Alternatively ROS production above basal levels or production observed in a control population g log growing or untreated may also be used to set the CellROX hi threshold With the prior gating steps the normalizing denominator for the CellROX hi population is the sum total of cells with detectable fluorescence rather than all bacteria analyzed in the sample The general applicability and utility of the gating scheme is further illustrated in BCG for reductive respiratory activities using CTC and for cellular esterase activity using Figures C Similar considerations were made for FSC and SSC Step DNA counterstaining to differentiate cells from debris Step dye update and retention Step and dye activation above background fluorescence Step It is important to note here that CTC becomes insoluble upon reaction which results in strong fluorescence from activated dye molecules retained within the cells while the fluorescent carboxyfluoroscein product of is negatively charged and thus retained within cells longer than fluorescein This positive attribute is similar to the activity of CellRox Green CellROX Green is a Sensitive Detector of Superoxide but not H O ROS In addition to quantifying ROS identifying the ROS species generated during stress is a crucial step in establishing the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the stress response The challenge here is that the reactivity of individual fluorescent probes for specific ROS has not been clearly defined under biological conditions and many probes react with a variety of oxidants and free radical species We chose to use CellROX Green as an ROS probe due to its unique feature of having high fluorescence quantum yields only upon and binding to dsDNA Invitrogen This feature obviates artifacts due to altered membrane integrity resulting from stress or cell state and enhances accumulation of dye to maximize fluorescence signal intensity above background and autofluorescence in cells critical to setting the Dye gate in Step However for this probe especially there is a lack of clarity in the scientific community about its intracellular ROS specificity ResearchGate Choi et al and to our knowledge there is no consensus on its reactivity in bacterial cells CellROX Green is a propriety photostable dye which according to the manufacturer exhibits ROS reactivity that complements HPF Unlike HPF CellROX Green reacts with hydroxyl radicals O and t in vitro but not with H O NO ONOO or HOCl Invitrogen However CellROX Green has recently been claimed to react almost exclusively with O in vivo Choi et al Hence we sought to confirm the identity of the intracellular ROS detected by CellROX Green in bacteria using two ROS generators menadione a quinone that undergoes catalytic redox cycling to reduce molecular oxygen to O Hassan and Fridovich Iyanagi and H O that reacts with metals to produce extremely ferryl or hydroxyl radicals under specific conditions Imlay et al Imlay Bataineh et al CellROX Green reproducibly detected of intracellular ROS when incubated for h with live bacteria in the presence of menadione in PBS Figure While menadione can induce CellROX species by indirect mechanisms such as alterations of cell metabolism that lead to ROS production Marinho et al we observed no shift in FSC SSC or fluorescence signals in either the DAPI or CellROX Green channels Figures B which ruled out

of Dye or CellROX hi cells were detected with H O treatment in PBS even at bactericidal concentrations Figure and Supplementary Figure H O exposures did not change SSC FSC or fluorescent profiles of either bacterial species which suggests minimal contributions by fluorescence or light scattering Figures D CellROX Green is highly sensitive to hydroxyl radicals arising from Fe H O Fenton chemistry as demonstrated with hydroxyl radicals generated in reactions of ferrous perchlorate with H O Invitrogen So our results suggest that H O hydroxyl radicals and other H O ROS do not reach levels detectable by CellROX Green in H O E coli or M smegmatis This observation stands in contrast to previous observations in human cells treated with H O Segard et al However the fluorescence attributed to CellROX dye in the studies of Segard et al is possibly due to autofluorescence or morphologic changes in FSC SSC caused by extreme protein aggregation in these studies Changes in autofluorescence and morphology and not dye activation similarly accounted for increased fluorescence observed in E coli Renggli et al Paulander et al Our findings with menadione and hydroxyl H O support the conclusion that bacterial exposure to even high levels of H O does not produce hydroxyl radicals at a level detectable by activation of CellROX Green and the conclusion by Choi et al that CellROX Green is a sensitive detector of O in bacteria Basal Superoxide Levels Depend upon the Bacterial Metabolic State Here we tested the ability of CellROX Green to detect changes in O levels in cells in different states of respiration and growth A major source of O in respiring cells involves reduction of O by electrons leaking from the bacterial respiratory chain from NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome b and at the ubiquinone sites In E coli this O production varies according to nutrient levels at least at early times following changes in nutrient sources and levels and Demple Turrens Korshunov and Imlay Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al Adolfsen and Brynildsen Lobritz et al To assess the effects of active respiration on basal O levels we performed CellROX Green staining after transferring actively dividing E coli and M smegmatis into either LB or media respectively in PBS or into PBS both after washing twice in their respective media After min in the absence of LB or in which cells have reduced respiration due to acute nutrient deprivation both E coli and M smegmatis had very low levels of activated CellROX Green fluorescence compared to the background signal from unstained cells Figures B However of both cell types in media PBS showed evidence of dye uptake and a uniform several increase in the CellROX hi fluorscence Figures B CellROX Green activation observed in cells in the presence of LB or media is likely attributable to higher basal metabolism in the actively dividing cells which leads to O and Demple Turrens Korshunov and Imlay Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al Adolfsen and Brynildsen Lobritz et al FIGURE Basal O production in actively dividing E coli and M smegmatis Histograms of DNA E coli and M smegmatis demonstrating increased CellROX Green

Stationary OD ANOVA with multiple comparisons versus WT E coli Bars represent mean SEM N P P P To verify that metabolically derived O is the predominant ROS species reacting with CellROX Green in these actively respiring cells we quantified dye activation in E coli knockout strains lacking SODs sodA and sodB and grown in LB to different states of cell density log late log and stationary Cytosolic O is rapidly converted to H O by the SODs at rates cat K M M s Berg et al As shown in Figure there is a significant increase in CellROX hi cells among the strains lacking SOD compared to E coli Further by accounting for differences in cell numbers at early and stationary cultures by adjusting for turbidity and events collected acquisition Figure we recapitulated previous observations that metabolic O generation correlates with growth cellular metabolic activity rather than overall culture viability Yamashoji et al These results provide further support for the conclusion that CellROX Green activation in bacteria is predominantly due to reactions with O Superoxide Production There is emerging and intriguing evidence for multiple roles for ROS in the bacterial response to antibiotic exposure Nguyen et al Grant et al Dwyer et al However methods using dyes to identify and quantify ROS in bacteria are prone to artifacts in the absence of rigorous controls For example changes in cell morphology can increase background fluorescence instead of activating the dye Kohanski et al Renggli et al Paulander et al the use of dyes in batch culture methods does not inform about ROS inside cells Albesa et al and there is disagreement about the ability of dyes to gain entrance into bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and M smegmatis Nguyen et al Grant et al In all of these cases rigorous flow cytometric gating to control for dye uptake cell morphology and background fluorescence could minimize these problems Here we illustrate this idea using CellROX Green to assess the relationship between ROS production and cytotoxicity in M smegmatis treated with mechanistically distinct antibiotics known to be effective against mycobacteria ethambutol wall synthesis streptomycin to ribosome rifampicin to RNA isoniazid mycolic acid kanamycin to ribosome and norfloxacin M smegmatis cytotoxicity curves for these antibiotics are shown in Figure FIGURE Changes in the

antibiotic exposures on FSC SSC and background fluorescence in M smegmatis As shown in Supplementary Figure while there were no consistent changes in SSC or increased background fluorescence absence of there were and shifts to lower SSC in treated bacteria Given the recognized link between SSC shift and bacterial cell cycle progression Walberg et al b elongation Renggli et al and the uniquely asymmetric cell division of mycobacteria Kieser and Rubin these results are consistent with a delayed cell elongation in M smegmatis populations hours after the initial drug exposure After accounting for morphological changes in and background fluorescence we next assessed O generation in M smegmatis using CellROX Green As shown in Figures C antibiotics did not consistently cause O generation in M smegmatis While ethambutol rifampicin and isoniazid increased CellROX hi levels after h of treatment Figure and as early as h after treatment Figure norfloxacin and kanamycin treatments produced minimal or no ROS in response to h treatment Figure For streptomycin no ROS was observed after h of exposure Figure while too many cells were killed at h for accurate measurements Quantitative relationships between CellROX activation and cytotoxicity caused by the antibiotics were observed to be inconsistent in three studies First treatment with ethambutol produced killing while of the cells produced ROS across all tested doses Figures B We then assessed toxicity by with propidium iodide a dye that is excluded from viable cells but enters cells with damaged membranes and by survival as units Based on flow cytometry contour plots such as those in Supplementary Figures uptake of PI and CellROX varied among antibiotic exposures However similar proportions of cells were stained with PI in both the total population Figure and the CellROX hi population Figure at h In a third set of studies the inconsistency of ROS formation and cell toxicity was more pronounced in CFU cell death assays for both E coli and M smegmatis Figure Together these data suggest that the mechanisms by which antibiotics cause increased O production are unique to each antibiotic and elevated O levels alone are not causative or predictive of cell death Finally we assessed the formation of O in M smegmatis clones induced to be resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin two antibiotics that caused significant O production Figures C bacteria were generated by culturing M smegmatis in varying concentrations of antibiotics for days Despite several logs of killing by mL isoniazid and rifampicin at h Figure days of growth in the presence of the antibiotics led to a population Figure Compared to M smegmatis treated for h the bacteria displayed greatly reduced O production following antibiotic exposures Figure Furthermore there were fewer PI bacteria e bacteria with damaged and no positive correlation between PI staining and antibiotic concentration at days was observed in contrast with the same treatment after h Figures G The mechanisms by which bacteria became resistant to the antibiotics was not established Nutrient Deprivation Induces Superoxide Production and Antibiotic Tolerance in Mycobacteria We next assessed O generation in mycobacteria in the and e physiological state caused by nutrient deprivation Xie et al Gengenbacher et al Interestingly starved bacteria consistently produced significantly higher levels of endogenous O than cells Figures This was not a quirk of M smegmatis as we observed the same phenomenon in M bovis BCG when starved up to days Figures Given this increase in basal O production and the observation that increased ROS levels render some bacteria susceptible to killing by specific antibiotics Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al Adolfsen and Brynildsen Belenky et al we quantified antibiotic sensitivity of or starved BCG with the TB antibiotics isoniazid rifampicin ethambutol or streptomycin As shown in Figures starved mycobacteria were tolerant to all four antibiotics compared to bacilli in spite of elevated basal O production This idiosyncratic behavior of persisters led us to investigate the effect of antibiotic exposure on O levels in these cells After accounting for elevated basal O caused by starvation we found that generation of O in starved BCG was idiosyncratic to the antibiotic While higher than basal levels of O were observed in BCG for isoniazid and ethambutol Figures K as observed for M smegmatis Figures C elevated O generation above the basal level was not observed in starved BCG treated with streptomycin isoniazid or ethambutol Figures which agrees with other studies on ROS in persisters Nguyen et al Grant et al FIGURE Endogenous and O in starved M bovis BCG and M smegmatis Representative contour plots of and

esterase M CFDA activities in for and days in PBS and replicating days in M bovis BCG Data represent mean SEM for N P P P by unpaired t as indicated A possible explanation for the lack of endogenous O induction in persisters is metabolic quiescence To test for metabolic activity in starved cells we performed staining of starved BCG with CTC CFDA and DAPI Enhanced respiratory activity was observed in a of cells as evident in the increase of the CTC hi during starvation and the reversal of CTC activation by incubation in medium Figure and Supplementary Figure Starvation also increased cellular esterase activity as shown by a CFDA hi Figure and Supplementary Figure which again is reversed by transfer to medium Together these observations eliminate metabolic stasis as the cause of the muted ROS production in the response of starved BCG antibiotic exposure Another possible explanation for reduced O generation in mycobacteria is the active exclusion of drugs through efflux pumps Indeed drug efflux pumps are often in cells Sarathy et al Maisonneuve and Gerdes However we observed that rifampicin treatment induced O generation in a manner in both log and starved BCG Figure in spite of of transcription of a known rifampicin efflux pump M tuberculosis Adams et al Figure Even with enhanced O production above an already high basal level rifampicin treatment did not result in cell death Figure indicating that starved BCG is refractory to O killing unlike E coli Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al Adolfsen and Brynildsen Belenky et al These findings demonstrate that O production and associated killing is both and cell Discussion The use of fluorescent probes combined with flow cytometry is a powerful approach to investigate biological processes within single cells as well as in cell populations We developed a gating strategy to minimize false positive signals and artifacts by accounting for DNA content changes in cell morphology dye uptake and retention and target specific dye activation in bacterial cells This approach is generally applicable to intracellular metabolic probes as illustrated here with CellROX Green CTC and With specific application to CellROX Green the flow cytometry method provides quantitative measurement of light scatter and fluorescence emission by this O fluorescent probe thus allowing measurement of O in of individual cells within a sample in addition to the population abundance The gating scheme presented here makes use of several gating strategies for mammalian cells and systematically applies them to bacteria at each of the four steps The basis for Step is the selection of the cell population of interest based on scatter properties such as when selecting for lymphocytes versus monocytes or granulocytes Although commonly used in environmental microbiology scatter properties of bacteria have not been considered in ROS studies DNA content staining as in Step although not absolutely necessary strengthens the precision and accuracy of the data by distinguishing bacteria from particles of similar sizes It also provides an additional parameter for analysis along with FSC and SSC which together can distinguish different bacteria or bacteria in different cell states Muller and Finally DNA content gives information about life cycle stages within the population that may provide insight into stress response mechanisms While large aggregates and dramatic filamentation would be excluded in our plots due to the flow cytometer settings for FSC particles um are collected during the gating scheme does not necessarily ignore elongated cells and instead accounts for their elongation By taking into account increases in fluorescence observed in cells with higher SSC or FSC by gating such as SSC versus cells with increased SSC or FSC can be selected for analysis if they pass the subsequent gates for increases in green fluorescence to be considered Dye and then CellROX hi This gating procedure normalizes for changes in SSC by not using flat cutoffs as in histograms g at fluorescence of If one does see two distinct populations of cells separate size gates or DNA content gates can be made for each population followed by consistent gating for green fluorescence The changes in background green fluorescence are not the same magnitude as activated CellROX Green dye so generation of ROS in cells with high background staining should be distinguishable using unstained and stained treated cells Together Steps and of the gating scheme select for probe fluorescence inside cells which validates the location of the probe reaction with ROS Step selects all cells with fluorescence above controls This basal fluorescence must be considered a conservative baseline signal that accounts for detection of unreacted reacted or degraded dye in the cell or less likely adhering to the cell surface as well as fluorescence from intracellular components Considering that culture conditions bacterial species and stress can affect dye permeability in some bacteria Walberg et al an assessment of dye content in each cell becomes important whenever possible The point of gating Step is a conservative one to minimize noise and artifacts by including in the analysis only cells that appear to have taken up a dye molecule By setting the selection threshold for Step above these basal levels Step selects cells with a high probability of containing an dye molecule It is important to use the Dye gate as the denominator for determining positive ROS signals as different stress treatments change the basal fluorescence There are several advantages to this a gating flow cytometry method ROS in bacterial populations have been evaluated with fluorescent dyes using plate readers or by measuring mean fluorescence intensity in total cell populations collected using a flow cytometer Kohanski et al Nguyen et al Dwyer et al However the problem with these approaches is that depending upon the gating of the flow cytometer data the use of controls and rigorous characterization of the dye sensitivity and specificity these fluorescence methods can yield false positives due to background fluorescence from the dye or the treatment as reported previously and observed in the present studies Renggli et al Paulander et al Plate reader data also suffers from artifacts of extracellular fluorescence Moreover mean or median changes in fluorescence in total populations may reflect a small proportion of cells producing high levels of ROS or a large proportion generating low to moderate amounts of ROS Given evidence for the intracellular ROS concentration as a determinant of cellular responses to specific antibiotics Brynildsen et al the ability to both identify ROS and measure ROS abundance at the single cell level is vital to understanding mechanisms of cellular responses The strategy presented here for detection of ROS with a flow cytometer combined with rigorous gating of populations allows for determination of relative abundance of ROS generation within single cells One of the advantages of using CellROX Green activation as a O index in bacteria involves retention of activated dye in cells by binding to DNA which prevents loss of activated probe through efflux pumps or leakage through damaged cell membranes In terms of the chemical identify of the ROS species detected by CellROX Green we conclude that this dye selectively detects O in bacterial populations under a variety of environmental conditions and exposures Our results with menadione exposure and SOD mutant strains are consistent with published studies pointing to CellROX Green specificity for O in bacterial cells Choi et al We cannot rule out dye activation by RNS such as peroxynitrite the reaction product of NO and O which decays to generate nitrogen dioxide radical NO and hydroxyl radical Dedon and Tannenbaum However it is unlikely that even with high O levels there would be significant ONOO formation in bacteria under the exposure conditions used here The relative insignificance of hydroxyl radicals generated from ONOO is further emphasized by the fact that even high concentrations of H O which is to react with reducing metals to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals or equivalently reactive ferryl radicals Imlay et al Imlay did not produce detectable activation of CellROX Green This points to either a relative insensitivity of the dye to hydroxyl radicals in vivo or to production of significantly lower levels of hydroxyl radicals relative to O in the cells H O can also lead to indirect ROS and RNS production in cells by activating transcription factors such as OxyR and PerR in bacteria to remodel cell metabolism and energetics with resulting increases in O and other radical species Marinho et al Again the lack of H O CellROX Green activation rules out such a mechanism H O metabolic remodeling may explain the activation of CellROX Green in H O human cells Segard et al However our studies reveal a lack of ROS species in bacteria exposed to levels of H O Clearly the interpretation of studies using H O as a calibrant in studies of ROS generation should be approached with caution The results of our studies with E coli and M smegmatis reveal several types of heterogeneity and idiosyncrasy in the bacterial ROS responses to chemical stimuli which warrant customization of the ROS method and caution in interpreting the results For example both types of bacteria showed different responses to menadione as a population in fluorescence histograms Figures D With increasing menadione exposures a increase in size of the CellROX hi M smegmatis was observed However there was no change in the population distribution as demonstrated by the absence of any change in the mean median or mode fluorescence intensity Figure In contrast two distinct populations emerged during menadione stress for E coli This change in population distribution was most evident at high menadione concentrations when a significant increase in the mean median and mode fluorescence intensity between low and high menadione exposures was observed Figure While we do not have a mechanistic explanation for this behavior we note that it is a consistent and reproducible shift in the size of the CellROX hi subpopulation in response to menadione indicating O stress It cannot be ruled out however that in longer exposures to menadione further fluorescence shifts in the population of both E coli and M smegmatis would occur However under current conditions the two bacteria both produce CellROX ROS but with different staining patterns These differences between E coli and M smegmatis suggest caution in extrapolating ROS results across bacterial species and genera In some cases it is not even possible to compare across different types of bacteria to due dye accessibility problems We shared the same problem experienced by Grant et al that HPF could not be used to detect ROS in M smegmatis even though it works with E coli This same caution in interpreting the results of ROS dye signals and extrapolating results across species must be applied to studies of antibiotic pharmacodynamics While fluorescent probes have been used to explore ROS generation caused by antibiotic exposure Kohanski et al Nguyen et al Dwyer et al Grant et al there is no unifying mechanistic model to explain why ROS are generated with specific antibiotics in some bacterial species but not others and more importantly which type of ROS is generated Our findings with CellROX Green in M smegmatis and E coli under the variety of conditions that cause increases in ROS lead us to conclude that O generation is not a universal feature of antibiotic stress does not distinguish bactericidal from bacteriostatic antibiotics and is not generally predictive of cell death Figure Rather our data suggest that ROS production is dependent on the physiological state of the cell specifically on changes in metabolism Previous studies of ROS metabolism in antibiotic tolerant bacteria revealed clear differences in the interaction Nguyen et al Maisonneuve and Gerdes Similarly our observation of O production during rifampicin treatment may be related to enzyme induction and metabolism as the antibiotic is a potent inducer of human cytochrome enzymes most notably and subfamily Madan et al This suggests that rifampicin may also induce CYPs in mycobacteria Niemi et al Since CYP activity is to generate high levels of O Denisov et al Munro et al our observation of CellROX Green activation in both and starved bacilli following rifampicin exposure Figures is consistent with previous studies showing transcriptional of different CYPs in mycobacteria following exposure to a variety of antibiotics Boshoff et al Indeed recently released microarray datasets for transcriptional response to antibacterial agents in the closely related human pathogen M tuberculosis shows that several CYPs including and are upregulated in response to rifampicin Gene Ontology Omnibus Accession The presence of elevated basal ROS levels in starved mycobacteria might suggest a vulnerability in light of evidence that potentiate existing ROS to promote bacterial cell death Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al Adolfsen and Brynildsen Belenky et al However our observations in mycobacteria do not support this as a universal model For instance the mycobacteria generated through nutrient deprivation have elevated O Figure yet are significantly resistant to four tuberculosis antibiotics Figures While endogenous ROS production has been correlated with antibiotic killing in some cases Brynildsen et al Dwyer et al increases in intracellular O levels in starved mycobacteria failed to potentiate the activities of several antibiotics This observation also raises concerns about the conclusion that the O tuberculosis antibiotic clofazimine which also binds tightly to DNA and RNA facilitates killing of persistent M smegmatis by virtue of O production Grant et al It is possible that cytotoxic activity involves tight binding of its reduced free radical form to DNA and RNA as demonstrated for the parent compound Morrison and Marley to create covalent adducts In any event our results demonstrate that O is unlikely to be the cause of toxicity in persistent or mycobacteria Finally we address the impact of potential heterogeneity in what appears to be changes in uptake of dye molecules into individual cells This issue becomes apparent for example in the increased proportion of cells appearing in the Dye gate following menadione treatment Figure which correlates with the proportion of cells with a fluorescence signal greater than untreated cells hi Figures C What appears to be a increase in the number of cells taking up dye raises the concerns that an increased CellROX hi signal could occur in spite of constant ROS levels dye molecules to or as a result of a large influx of unactivated weakly fluorescent parent dye molecules It is important to point out that the flow cytometry method is limited in its ability to precisely quantify the contribution of increases in dye uptake of individual cells such as increased permeability to CellROX Green or reduced efflux of the dye However the nature of the gating strategy the cell permeability and spectroscopic properties of the fluorescent dye and our observations of membrane permeability changes using PI argue that increases in CellROX Green fluorescence are truly due to increases in O levels in the cells First the Dye gate precedes CellROX hi gating so the latter is a subset of the former and in a rising tide argument increases in the Dye population will naturally accompany increases in the CellROX hi population The Dye gate of increased fluorescence above unstained cells is intended to be a conservative barrier to rule out artifacts so it is possible that untreated cells taking up smaller amounts of the weakly fluorescent dye will be gated out of the analysis for the sake of accuracy at the cost of sensitivity while increases in ROS levels in treated cells will raise the fluorescence of these previously missed cells above the threshold for Dye Second our analysis of antibiotic exposure and ROS in Figure revealed that there is no correlation between changes in membrane permeability and the magnitude of the CellROX hi signal ETM caused the highest CellROX Green fluorescence Figures C and the lowest membrane damage Figures F Third CellROX Green is a dye so its concentration should equilibrate between bulk solvent and cell interior The spectroscopic properties of CellROX Green imply that very high levels of unactivated dye must accumulate in a cell to produce a signal that rivals the magnitude of dye Assuming that CellROX Green has spectral properties roughly similar to HPF then both molar absorptivity and quantum efficiency are greatly increased by ROS activation and respectively Setsukinai et al This implies that an approximately increase in intracellular CellROX Green concentration would be needed to produce the equivalent of a increase in CellROX Green fluorescence above the mean median or fluorescence of the population The additional requirement for DNA binding to achieve the enhanced fluorescence by CellROX Green Invitrogen further reduces the likelihood that unactivated dye could account for changes in CellROX hi This is also consistent with the observation by Choi et al that permeabilization of the E coli cell membrane wall by Triton did not alter CellROX Green fluorescence Finally if the increased fluorescence in cells were simply due to increased dye concentration then there would not be multiple distinct cell populations observed on the flow cytometer g Figure All of this evidence rules out and changes in dye uptake as the basis for increased CellROX hi detection of ROS Taken together the results of our studies demonstrate that properly controlled flow cytometry coupled with fluorescent probes provides precise and accurate quantitative analysis of ROS generation and metabolic changes in stressed bacteria The gating strategy provides for a consistent comparison based on specific parameters across multiple samples in spite of changes in cellular morphology or background fluorescence Application of this method with CellROX Green and diverse bacteria reveals that superoxide generation arises idiosyncratically due to transient or phenotypic alterations in cell physiology caused by environmental or chemical stresses and is itself not a primary

the motivation to move Dopamine and acetylcholine release sites are enriched in the striatum and are possibly to achieve optimal behavior Drugs of abuse which promote abnormally high dopamine release disrupt normal and drive restricted repetitive behaviors Stereotypies occur in a variety of disorders including disorder autism schizophrenia and Huntington s disease as well as in addictive states The severity of stereotypy is correlated with induction of expression in striosomes a striatal compartment that is related to the limbic system and that directly projects to neurons of the substantia nigra These characteristics of striosomes contrast with the properties of the matrix which has strong sensorimotor and associative circuit inputs and outputs Disruption of acetylcholine signaling in the striatum blocks the expression pattern induced by drugs of abuse and alters stereotypy The activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons is associated with behaviors related to sensory cues and cortical inputs to striosomes can bias in the face of conflicting cues The neurons and neuropil of striosomes and matrix neurons have observably separate distributions both at the input level in the striatum and at the output level in the substantia nigra Notably cholinergic axons readily cross compartment borders providing a potential route for local communication to maintain a balance between striosomal and matrix activity We show here by slice electrophysiology in transgenic mice that repetitive evoked firing patterns in striosomal and matrix striatal projection neurons are interrupted by optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons either by the addition or the deletion of spikes We demonstrate that this cholinergic modulation of projection neurons is blocked in brain slices taken from mice exposed to amphetamine and engaged in stereotypy and lacking responsiveness to salient cues Our findings support a model whereby activity in striosomes is normally under strong regulation by cholinergic interneurons favoring behavioral flexibility but that in animals with stereotypy this cholinergic signaling breaks down resulting in differential modulation of striosomal activity and an inability to bias according to relevant sensory cues striosome striatum amphetamine stereotypy cholinergic interneuron National Institute of Mental Health Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Simons Foundation Introduction Pathologically repetitive and restricted behaviors known as stereotypies occur in numerous disorders and are notably difficult to disrupt suggesting a failure in attention to environmental cues that might normally direct a change in behavior Stereotypies can also be induced in humans and other animals by high doses of drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine Animals with stereotypic behavior exhibit high gene induction in striatal projection neurons within the striosome compartment of the striatum relative to low activation in SPNs located in the surrounding matrix compartment and Graybiel Tan et al Saka et al Crittenden and Graybiel Horner et al Jedynak et al Such differential induction in striosomes relative to induction in the matrix is blocked by intrastriatal ablation of cholinergic interneurons to herein as along with interneurons et al and manipulations of ChI signaling have a direct impact on the severity of and stereotypies et al Collins and Izenwasser Thomsen et al Aliane et al Crittenden et al drug treatments also are related to an imbalance in activity of cortical regions that differentially project to the striatal striosome or matrix compartment Kincaid and Wilson Aliane et al Friedman et al Kupferschmidt et al All together these findings suggest that a balance in activity between and ganglia loops could be critical for behavioral flexibility In contrast to the widespread interconnections that occur among the and SPNs of the direct and indirect output pathways et al SPNs that lie in the striosome or matrix compartments seem particularly separated not only physically but also electrophysiologically et al Banghart et al et al though with some crossing of their processes et al Walker et al Striosomal SPNs give rise to a unique striatonigral connection to subgroups of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta that produce dopamine and Graybiel Fujiyama et al et al Crittenden et al a neurotransmitter that is released by all known drugs of abuse and is a key driver of motivated behaviors and movement initiation Dodson et al Howe and Dombeck Further the neurons project back both to striosomes and matrix suggesting a circuit by which striosomes could exert both localized and global control over the dorsal striatum et al For technical reasons few studies have addressed how striosomal neurons are regulated and striosomes are difficult targets because they comprise only of the SPN populations which primarily occupy the extrastriosomal matrix that houses the cells of origin of the classic direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways for motor control Yet striosomes are preferential targets of some cortical regions related to the limbic system and they target lateral circuits and the nigral pars compacta both implicated in motivation and behaviors Thus striosomal SPNs insofar as they act through their main GABAergic neurotransmitter mechanism are well placed to counterbalance of the dopamine system The relative segregation of striosomal and matrix SPNs raises the question of what mechanisms maintain the normal balance of the striatal compartments including the balanced expression of gene products such as expression that becomes in animals exhibiting stereotypy ChIs and other interneurons that are located along the striosomal borders are leading candidates for coordinating activity between the two compartments et al Sandell et al Kubota and Kawaguchi Aosaki et al Mounir and Parent Miura et al Brimblecombe and Cragg ChIs are thought to correspond to the tonically active neurons of the striatum which respond to salient or instructive stimuli with an activation pause and rebound pattern of activity et al Aosaki et al Blazquez et al Minamimoto and Kimura Goldberg and Reynolds Doig et al Thorn and Graybiel This is among TANs across the striatum and is driven by input from the neocortex and from the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus which are themselves activated by sensory inputs et al Matsumoto et al Morris et al Brown et al Doig et al Strategic switching behaviors exhibited in learning tasks are impacted by manipulations of ChIs in the striatum et al McCool et al Brown et al Okada et al The extreme loss of behavioral flexibility that occurs in animals engaged in stereotypies is likewise modulated by cholinergic manipulations et al Collins and Izenwasser Thomsen et al Aliane et al Crittenden et al These findings suggest that thalamic and cortical input to the ChIs of the dorsal striatum helps to motor systems to modulate behavioral flexibility in the face of conflicting cues or overload of the dopamine system et al Minamimoto et al Eskow Jaunarajs et al Whether striosomal and matrix SPNs are differentially controlled by ChIs however has not been tested We now have performed such a test and have specifically asked whether we could estimate the ChIs modulation of SPN firing activity related to stereotypies by examining SPN responses in slices prepared from animals actively engaged in such behaviors It is known from much work on striatal slices that activation of ChIs induces GABA release from local sources to drive inhibitory responses in SPNs et al English et al Luo et al Nelson et al Faust et al These measurements have been made without identification of striatal compartments but likely were made mostly in the large matrix compartment Inoue and colleagues et al have now identified striosomes in a brain slice recording preparation by using young transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter et al which is in young mice days of Paired neuronal recordings in these mice demonstrated that SPNs and other ChIs can inhibit ChIs within and across compartments et al consistent with the fact that ChI neuropil crosses compartment borders et al Crittenden et al Whether ChI activation induces the prominent pause in activity in both striosomal and matrix SPNs was not examined We performed slice recordings and optogenetic stimulation of ChIs in double transgenic mice that have GFP and channelrhodopsin in ChIs application of a blue light pulse to the slices induced a single spike in the ChIs We show here that this ChI stimulation produced a brief inhibition of evoked repetitive firing in both striosomal and matrix SPNs We also observed in SPNs of both the matrix and striosomes that the optogenetic activation of ChIs occasionally induced a in the SPN firing pattern All of these effects were blocked by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist Furthermore in brain slices taken from transgenic mice engaged in stereotypies and to salient cues ChI stimulation failed to disrupt the evoked repetitive striosomal and matrix SPN firing These results raise the proposal favored here that the loss of behavioral flexibility that occurs in animals under the influence of psychomotor stimulants could result from a failure in the ability of ChIs to reset ongoing striatal activity and motor behavior in response to relevant environmental cues Materials and

Amphetamine treatments and behavioral tests Mice were injected at am in their home cage for days with saline only ml kg day i p followed by daily injections of dissolved in saline mg kg day ml kg i p or saline vehicle followed by days without treatment and then a final challenge with amphetamine mg or saline To measure behavior on challenge day the bedding was removed from the cages of the test mice the mice received their challenge injection of saline for the control and min later a ball of bedding was introduced from a mixture from cages of female mice mice were challenged again with saline days later and the same test was done but with bedding from their own home cage Mice were videotaped and their behavior was scored for a min period beginning at min after the introduction of the cage bedding An experimenter blinded to mouse treatment scored the videotapes using a keyboard scoring system with the public domain software version of California Los Angeles CA USA and Macquarie University Sidney Australia http www jwatcher ucla edu Individual keys were assigned to score resting locomotion sniffing or touching bedding and highly confined stereotypy The interaction of mice with female cage bedding vs their own home cage bedding was compared by a Student s t The interaction of mice vs mice with female cage bedding was compared by an unpaired Student s t Statistical analysis of stereotypy and interaction with female bedding was made on mice that carry the transgene alone but equivalent severe stereotypy was observed in all double transgenic mice that were used

experiment A Digidata digitizer and were used for data acquisition and analysis and signals were amplified with a Multiclamp amplifier A holding command of mV was applied to the patched cell and once the mode was established the cell was allowed to stabilize for min Both SPNs and ChIs were identified by size and shape and by intrinsic membrane properties In mode light application evoked depolarization and action potentials in identified ChIs in all except for one mouse that was therefore dropped from the study In the single transgenic virally injected mice and double transgenic mice a blue LED pulse was used to stimulate ChIs In the double BAC transgenic mice a shutter was briefly opened to activate the ChIs For analysis of action potentials in SPNs each SPN was maintained at resting membrane potential and injected for ms with depolarization currents of pA current injection for adequate action potential After a rest of s the same current sweep was repeated this time with blue light application at ms after the beginning of current injection After min of rest another such pair of light current sweeps was given but with a slightly higher current injection to induce higher frequency firing A total of or pairs of light current sweeps were given to each cell In recordings from two mice and additional experiments with double BAC transgenic mice Tocris Bristol was added to the perfusate after the initial recordings and slices were allowed to equilibrate for min before repetition of action potential measurements Electrophysiological data analyses Data were obtained and recorded in ClampFit and the output abf files were converted in MiniAnalysis to assign the timestamp of each spike For spike density functions a kHz sampling rate was used The value was assigned at each sample that corresponded to a spike time and the remaining samples were assigned the value The resulting time series was then smoothed with a Hanning window whose was ms For the Grubbs test to identify outlier interspike intervals trials of two sweeps without blue light pulse one were selected based on the following criteria the combined baseline period contained at least ISIs the period contained at least two ISIs trial failed this test after passing the first the combined baseline ISIs were normally distributed according to the Lilliefors test with alpha low alpha value was chosen because of the small sample sizes under and the combined baseline ISIs did not contain any outliers as determined by the Grubbs test All but one neuron had at least one analyzable trial although in most cases the first trials had too few spikes to analyze The first ISI was discarded because in some instances it appeared to be longer than the remaining ones To test for a significant response the minimum ISI recorded during the period was added to the baseline set of ISIs and the Grubbs test for an outlier was performed To test for a response the Grubbs test was performed again but with the maximum ISI added to the baseline set If the duration between the last spike of the trial and the termination of current injection was longer than the longest recorded ISI it was used in place of the maximum ISI As two Grubbs tests were performed on each of trials that met our criteria we used the Bonferroni correction for comparisons to set alpha corresponding to a p level of for the entire set of comparisons The Lilliefors statistical test was performed using the Matlab function Other tests were performed by code written around the Matlab functions squared and Results Mice engaged in repetitive behaviors fail to respond to a sensory cue and exhibit induction To test whether mice with stereotypies fail to respond to salient sensory cues we measured the response of male mice to the introduction of bedding from female cages to their own cage To induce stereotypy mice were treated for days with mg kg day i p followed by days of and then a challenge dose mg kg i p as previously described Crittenden et al Control mice were treated in parallel with vehicle injections only On the challenge day at min after injection we introduced a ball of used bedding taken from multiple cages of females We scored the times the mice spent sniffing the bedding locomoting or engaging in confined stereotypic behaviors based on a video taken min after the introduction of the female bedding Control mice spent between and of the time sniffing the female bedding We compared this level to the times that they interacted with bedding that had been taken from their own home cage and found that they spent significantly more time interacting with the female cage bedding supporting the interpretation that female cage bedding is a salient cue By contrast mice that were treated with repeated amphetamine spent most of their time engaging in stereotypic behaviors sometimes interrupted by running bouts and did not interact with the female cage bedding at all Figure Mice with stereotypy fail to engage with a salient sensory cue Schedule of or saline injections Analysis of behavior in n or mice n for a min videotaped interval at min after injection and min

ratios of gene activation as occurs in rats and monkeys and Graybiel Saka et al Horner et al Jedynak et al we imaged expression in striatal sections taken from mice n compared to mice n To detect the striosome and matrix compartments we used BAC transgenic mice et al with an enhanced GFP reporter for the signaling molecule et al Crittenden et al The compartmental selectivity of expression followed gradients across the striatum with the compartmental borders being easiest to identify in the central and lateral parts of the caudoputamen mice were treated with or saline according to the schedule shown in Figure and brain tissue was taken for analysis min after the challenge injection Mice that received amphetamine injections but none of the mice were engaged in stereotypic behaviors at the time of euthanasia control mice showed low levels of expression in cell nuclei distributed across both compartments in the striatum By contrast the striatum of the mice showed strong expression of in the striosomes with a lower density of nuclei in the surrounding matrix compartment Figure Induction of expression is in mice Image of GFP fluorescence in a coronal hemisection through the left

of the striatum project their axons into both striosome and matrix compartments of both control and mice To allow simultaneous detection of striatal ChIs and compartments we crossed the BAC mice to mice In the mice Cre recombinase is fused to the end of the choline acetyltransferase gene at its endogenous locus et al so as not to evoke of the nearby VAChT gene as has been reported to occur in ChAT BAC transgenic mice et al Crittenden et al We labeled ChIs in the double transgenic mice by intrastriatal injections of an virus encoding a transgene for the mCherry fluorophore fused to channelrhodopsin et al The infected cells resembled ChIs in that they were large and appeared scattered across the striatum contained substantial cytoplasm in the soma and had multiple spots in the nucleus that stained for the DAPI et al We confirmed that these neurons expressed the endogenous cholinergic cell marker VAChT in their cell bodies cyan in Figures H Very fine ChI fibers presumably axons were present in both the striosomes and matrix Thicker presumably dendritic processes were concentrated in the matrix with some running along compartment borders and occasionally crossing the borders Figure Cholinergic interneuron processes in striosomes and matrix of control and mice Striatal sections from mice labeled for GFP in the matrix D I in ChIs E J and merged images from double transgenic mice F treated with saline or repeated Immunofluorescence for VAChT confirms the cholinergic identity of an neuron Asterisks indicate examples of striosomes To be sure that the ChI innervation of both striosomes and matrix was maintained after repeated treatment we injected the double transgenic mice intrastriatally with the waited for weeks and then treated the mice with according to the standard schedule prior to collection of brain tissue on the challenge day As in control mice cholinergic neurons were evident along with dense neuropil from infected ChIs Cholinergic neuropil though present in both compartments was not homogenously distributed across the striatum in accord with previous findings et al The cholinergic neuropil distribution was most clearly evident in mice with global labeling for cholinergic cell reporters transgenic mice and single BAC transgenic mice Figure Striosomes especially in the medial striatum were often visible as darker regions with reduced densities of large cholinergic processes both in the mice with intrastriatal viral injections and in the and BAC mice Figure Cholinergic neuropil is not homogenously distributed across the striatum through the left striatum from and BAC transgenic mice showing fluorescence labeling of global cholinergic neuropil in green relative to in red for the matrix marker or striosome marker Merged images Asterisks indicate examples of striosomes Cholinergic interneuron activation induces a pause or a spike advance to disrupt SPN firing patterns We made recordings from striatal neurons in the matrix and from striatal neurons within striosomes of BAC mice With the goal of testing for cholinergic modulation of excitatory inputs to SPNs we measured the amount of current injection required to induce repetitive spiking activity in striosomal and matrix SPNs SPNs typically fired regularly at current injection levels above rheobase and striosomal neurons were more excitable than matrix neurons in the striatal slices taken from mature mice n striosomal SPNs n matrix SPNs from Figures as previously reported for slices taken from young mice and rats et al Miura et al Smith et al Figure

potential current injection for rheobase frequency at rheobase IV curve and membrane time constant p by Rank Sum test As a direct test of whether the striatal ChIs can modulate activity in striosomal and matrix SPNs we then made recordings in coronal slices through the striatum of double transgenic mice in which intrastriatal injections of had been made At weeks after intrastriatal virus injection the double transgenic mice began daily saline injections in order that they could serve as controls for comparison to sibling mice treated with After the final injection we prepared brain slices and applied ms blue light pulses to the striatal slices This treatment reliably generated an action potential in ChIs of both and mice To test how ChI activation modulated SPN activity we induced epochs of regular SPN spiking activity by ms current injection sweeps We then compared SPN responses to current injection alone to the responses elicited s later by the same current injection combined with a ms light pulse beginning at ms after the start of current injection Most neurons in the control group exhibited a pause or marked reduction in spiking following the light pulse and some also showed a single spike at short latency after light application typically followed by a pause C n mice with viral expression of striatal neurons from striosomes from matrix and from mice with no These effects were found in both single transgenic mice and double transgenic mice To insure that the responses were not artifacts of light application we measured the SPN responses in single transgenic BAC mice with no expression In these control mice the light application did not disrupt firing at all not Figure ChI activation disrupts spiking pattern in striosomal and matrix SPNs but not after treatment

spike responses to stimulation Black traces show that ChIs expressing from injections fired single action potentials in response to ms blue light pulses blue in striatal slices from and mice Responses of a given SPN to the ChI activation were generally consistent across different trials at different current intensities as shown in Figures SPNs typically exhibited one of three response types advanced spike followed by a pause pause only advanced and The pause response was observed more frequently than the advanced spike response but there was one exceptional neuron that responded to the light with advanced spikes but no pause In neurons with advanced spikes the extra spikes were limited to a time window of about or ms after light onset To quantify these differences we developed a statistical analysis to detect both increases and decreases in firing rate on a basis For each trial ISIs were calculated for spikes in three time windows the first current injection the portion of the second current injection preceding the light and the remainder of the second current injection We then used Grubbs test Materials and for outliers to determine whether the shortest and or the longest ISIs could be considered outliers in the context of the baseline ISIs By this method we found that both the pause and the advanced spike responses were statistically significant Figure ChI activation induces a pause or a spike that disrupts SPN patterns Raster plots and spike density functions grouped according to neuronal response type SPN types are color coded as in Figure To show which trials belong to an individual SPN spikes from neurons within each color group are plotted as plus signs and those from as diamonds trial per SPNs recorded in mice showing advanced spike

of neurons in control mice analyzed neurons Matrix n Striosomal n Unidentified n Pause Advanced Both Neither If a neuron showed a statistically significant pause response in at least one trial then it was counted as having a pause response and similarly for advanced spike responses Striosomal SPNs can be more responsive to ChI modulation than matrix SPNs To calculate the statistical significance of the striosomal and matrix SPN responses to light we compared the total numbers of spikes in the response period from to ms after light onset to the numbers of spikes in the baseline and time windows We added the spike counts in the baseline and windows and then performed a test with Yates correction comparing the actual spike counts in the response window and combined baseline window with the values expected under the null hypothesis that the light had no effect The entire procedure was repeated separately for identified striosomal SPNs and identified matrix SPNs Striosomal SPNs as a group showed a significant effect of the light at a substantially lower p level than did the matrix group p vs p To verify that this difference reflected a stronger response to the light in striosomal SPNs we performed a test for dependence between the effects of neuron type vs and time window baseline vs The null hypothesis of no difference between striosomal and matrix SPNs was rejected with a significance level of p for the slice recordings from mice When aggregating spike counts across different neurons the results will be dominated by the highest firing neurons There were out of SPNs in the group and out of SPNs in the group that had spike counts during the combined baseline window that were more than times the aggregated median value We repeated the statistical analysis after excluding these neurons and found with a test that the group of striosomal SPNs still showed a trend to be more significantly affected than the matrix SPNs but now with a p Just as before the exclusion of the more highly firing neurons both the striosomal and matrix SPNs were found to be responsive to modulation p for striosomal vs p for matrix Table test results for effect of light on total spike count p Striosomal Matrix Saline Drug Table test results for effect of light after excluding neurons p Striosomal Matrix Saline Drug Firing activity of striosomal and matrix SPNs is resistant to disruption in mice with stereotypy To test whether SPNs from mice in a state of severe repetitive behavior exhibit abnormalities in the signaling microcircuit we recorded in slices taken from mice engaged in stereotypy n mice with viral expression of striatal neurons from striosomes from matrix and from mice with no On the amphetamine challenge day we isolated brain tissue at the min after injection and prepared striatal sections for recording The mice were confirmed to be in a state of stereotypy at the time of tissue collection ChIs in the dorsal striatum of slices from the mice responded reliably to light stimulation except in one data from this mouse were not included in the analyses We did not analyze baseline activity of ChI activity in control or mice but rather tested whether SPNs responded differently to the single spike induced by optogenetic stimulation of the ChIs The raster plots and spike density plots of the striosomal and matrix SPN responses to ChI stimulation showed a severely blunted SPN response in the slices from mice We evaluated the significance of the responses by performing tests with Yates correction to compare the spike counts in the and the baseline plus spike counts with the values expected under the null hypothesis that the light had no effect These tests showed that neither striosomal nor matrix SPN firing frequencies showed a significant response to the light p for striosomal SPNs and p for matrix We performed a test for dependence between the effects of neuron type vs and time window baseline vs and found that no difference was apparent p Although there were some neurons that showed a response to the light after treatment Figure the proportion of SPNs that responded was much lower in the group than in the group vs and this difference was significant by Fisher s exact test p Table Response types of SPNs in mice analyzed neurons Matrix n Striosomal n Unidentified n Pause Advanced Both Neither To confirm that our results were not unique to virally mediated expression of we also made recordings in double BAC transgenic mice that had global cholinergic expression of a transgene n and that were treated with either repeated saline or repeated For these tests we administered blue light with a manually controlled shutter thus inducing multiple spikes in the ChIs of and mice B We recorded from SPNs that were and SPNs that were in zones In the preparations we observed that the spiking pattern of both striosomal and matrix SPNs could be disrupted by a pause or by a spike advance as we had found for the SPN responses in mice with virally expressed However in slices taken from the mice expressing severe stereotypy n mice striatal SPNs from striosomes from the striosomal and matrix SPNs no longer responded to light H Thus ChI activation normally produced a pause or in the regular firing pattern of striosomal and matrix SPNs in brain slices from two different lines of transgenic mice but these effects were blocked in slices taken from mice exhibiting stereotypic behavior Figure ChI activation disrupts spiking patterns in striosomal and matrix SPNs by a pause or an advanced spike in BAC mice and the effect is blocked by treatment ChIs showed a burst of firing in response to blue light application by horizontal blue in striatal sections from and BAC mice spiking in striosomal C E and matrix D F SPNs is disrupted by an advanced spike or a pause after application The striosomal G and matrix H SPN responses to ChI activation with blue light is blocked in sections from mice treatment did not induce a chronic baseline failure in the ability of ChIs to disrupt SPN firing patterns Repeated methamphetamine treatments can produce prolonged changes in baseline striatal acetylcholine signaling et al To test whether the ChI to SPN signaling phenotype that we observed in mice was due to a baseline change in SPN responsivity we treated mice with the same drug treatment schedule but challenged them with saline not amphetamine prior to recording n mice striatal neurons from striosomes from matrix and from mice with no As before we harvested brain slices at min after the challenge and we confirmed in every slice that ChIs responded to the ms light pulse with a spike Optogenetic stimulation of ChIs in striatal slices taken from these mice appeared to disrupt SPN just as in mice that had never been exposed to drug A test comparing spike density in the baseline and periods to the period after light application highlighted in Figure showed that there was a significant effect in each mouse that was tested p and p and when the results from both mice were combined the value was p Figure Striosomal and matrix SPN responses to ChI activation were maintained in mice that received repeated treatment but were challenged with saline only Raster plots and spike density functions of all of the spikes recorded across all sweeps trial per In the raster plots matrix SPN spikes are in green striosomal SPN spikes in magenta and compartmentally unidentified SPN spikes from single transgenic mice in black To show which trials belong to an individual SPN spikes from neurons are plotted as plus signs and those from as diamonds Spike density functions are averaged over all trials from identified matrix and striosomal SPNs The blue line indicates the onset of ms light stimulus Gray shading denotes the and periods and yellow shading denotes the period The disruption of striosomal and matrix SPN firing pattern by ChI activation is dependent on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ChI signaling can drive disynaptic inhibition in SPNs by activating nicotinic receptors on nearby terminals et al English et al Tritsch et al Luo et al Nelson et al Faust et al We tested whether bath application of the nicotinic receptor antagonist would block the response to ChI stimulation that we found in striosomal and matrix SPNs We recorded from SPNs in the and SPNs all of which responded with a pause or a to the optogenetic stimulation of ChIs shown in Figures B left After bath application of these same SPNs no longer responded to the light B right Similarly in BAC mice blocked the responses of SPNs Figure Nicotinic acetylcholine antagonism blocks the ChI disruption of SPN spiking activity spiking in striosomal and matrix SPNs from mice is disrupted by blue light pulse but the effect is blocked after application of Spiking in two SPNs from BAC mice that showed an advanced spike or pause response that was blocked after application of Discussion ChIs send abundant axonal projections into striosomes and matrix circuits implicated in selecting behavioral responses to salient cues Stereotypy can be viewed as an extreme loss of behavioral flexibility and loss of responsiveness to salient cues a feature recognized in individuals with disorders on the autism spectrum et al Presentation of an instructive cue induces a response in striatal ChIs consisting of a brief activation followed by a pause in spiking and then a rebound activation before a return to unsynchronized tonic firing et al Minamimoto and Kimura Goldberg and Reynolds Doig et al Thorn and Graybiel A leading hypothesis is that this ChI response is important for an animal s ability to adapt its behavior in accordance with predicted outcomes et al McCool et al Brown et al Ding et al Goldberg and Reynolds Okada et al The response of ChIs to cue presentation is dependent upon inputs from the sensory thalamus the dopaminergic system and the cerebral cortex et al Goldberg and Reynolds Doig et al Inputs from sensory thalamus to ChI dendrites are et al Raju et al Consistently we observed that ChI dendrites appeared slightly more prominent in the matrix compartment relative to the high abundance of ChI axons in both striosomes and matrix Thus ChI dendrites as well as labeling of inputs from brainstem cholinergic projections et al likely account for the overall expression of transgene reporters immunomarkers and chemical markers for cholinergic processes et al Crittenden et al Psychomotor stimulants are well known to induce stereotypic behaviors and in accordance with this linkage we found that after repeated treatment male mice were engaged in stereotypy and failed to respond when we introduced the normally salient stimulus of bedding taken from female cages Multiple brain regions and signaling mechanisms are implicated in evoking stereotypic behaviors of different sorts Mason and Rushen In the dorsal striatum dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling modulate stereotypic behaviors et al Aliane et al Crittenden and Graybiel Both increases and decreases in acetylcholine signaling have been implicated in the induction of stereotypic behavior highlighting how a balance of neurotransmitter effects may be what is key to preventing this pathological behavior For example the ablation or inhibition of ChI signaling in the anteromedial dorsal striatum prolongs stereotypy in rats et al but as well mice with abnormally high levels of VAChT thought to augment acetylcholine release exhibit increased stereotypy et al Stimulation of the ionotropic nicotinic receptors increases motoric responses to cocaine and amphetamine et al Collins and Izenwasser whereas antagonism of the slower metabotropic muscarinic signaling system generally increases responses including stereotypy et al Aliane et al Thus the relationship between cholinergic signaling and stereotypy is complex with contradictory observations being reported Some ideas that may help reconcile them are muscarinic and nicotinic transmission may in general have opposite effects disrupting cholinergic transmission in different districts of the striatum has different effects and so stereotypies may be controlled both by stimulation and by inhibition of cholinergic transmission depending on exactly where and how the stimulation or inhibition is accomplished How this relates to the role of acetylcholine in remains unknown Drugs of abuse and imbalanced striosome vs matrix gene activation With repeated administration of psychomotor stimulants overall gene induction in the matrix of the dorsal striatum is suppressed relative to control treatments and Gerfen Nguyen et al and the ratio of gene induction is increased et al Canales and Graybiel Vanderschuren et al Saka et al Jedynak et al By contrast rats engaged in normal behaviors in their home cage are reported to have similar levels of metabolic activity in the two compartments et al Experiments aimed at directly ablating striosomes in rats by intrastriatal injection of toxins et al Lawhorn et al have been reported to result in reduced stereotypic responses to methamphetamine and increased induction in the matrix et al Our experimental mice showed the expected imbalance in induction after a challenge injection of with strong nuclear immunoreactivity in neurons of striosomes and low levels of in neurons of the surrounding matrix The mice showed immunostaining that was similar across the compartments The predominant striosomal activity in animals as measured by the proxy of induction could serve to minimize excess dopamine release driven by drugs of abuse This speculation would fit with a circuit model whereby relative activation of striosomal SPNs directly inhibits neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and relative silencing of matrix SPNs disinhibits substantia nigra reticulata neurons that thereby are released to inhibit the neurons ChI modulation of SPN spike firing patterns in striosomal and matrix SPNs The electrophysiological response of SPNs to direct ChI stimulation has been previously described without classification of striosomal or matrix cell type and thus should favor those in the matrix which makes up most of the total volume of the striatum Analyses of SPN responses to ChI stimulation have shown that there are multiple inhibitory currents with fast slow and very slow et al and small excitatory currents et al The inhibitory effects can be transmitted from ChIs to SPNs disynaptically via nicotinic release of GABA from neurogliaform and tyrosine striatal interneurons et al Luo et al Faust et al from other SPNs et al or from afferents et al Nelson et al Acetylcholine can also inhibit SPNs via muscarinic receptors on SPNs et al and via muscarinic suppression of glutamate release from cortical terminals et al The effects of ChI activation on striatal microcircuits can be particularly powerful at least as measured in slice preparations in that single spikes of ChIs can promote nicotinic release of GABA and recurrent inhibition et al Inoue et al The findings raise the possibility that the prominent pause in tonic ChI activity might in fact be preceded by a single instructive ChI action potential We found that optogenetic induction of a single spike in ChIs in striatal slices could induce both a brief pause of evoked firing activity and a spike advance in striatal SPNs Prolonged ChI stimulation appeared to have the same brief consequence on SPN firing patterns Relative to SPNs in the matrix we found that striosomal SPNs showed a greater response to ChI stimulation Considering the diversity of SPN cell types et al a larger sample of neurons would make this conclusion firmer We found that the SPN responses to ChI activation were blocked by bath application of the nicotinic receptor antagonist consistent with a disynaptic inhibition microcircuit such as that relayed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on GABAergic terminals All together these results suggest that there may be greater nicotinic transmission from GABAergic terminals onto at least some striosomal SPNs than onto matrix SPNs We and others previously found that subsets of nigral neurons et al and Graybiel Prensa and Parent Crittenden et al which from their positions are likely overlapping with those that synthesize GABA et al appeared to project more abundantly to striosomes than to the matrix Thus terminals from GABAergic neurons are one potential source of the increased inhibition of striosomal neurons Friedman and colleagues found that relatively selective activation of striosomal SPNs induced by optogenetic manipulation of prelimbic cortex input fibers biased rats decisions in a task so that rats were biased to choose the arm over the arm et al This effect appeared to be mediated by a microcircuit in which the activity of inhibitory interneurons of the striatum was normally enhanced by prelimbic cortical inputs during the task leading to suppression of putative striosomal SPNs but not of SPNs of the extrastriosomal matrix Our results here suggest that other microcircuits involving ChIs could be important for the relative inhibition or disruption of spike timing in striosomes It is clearly of great interest that these two classes of striatal interneurons both appear to affect SPN spike timing a fundamental characteristic of circuit organization and plasticity In some instances and in both compartments we observed an SPN spike that occurred within ms of the light application and sometimes much sooner raising the possibility of monosynaptic transmission from ChIs to SPNs Considering that evidence is sparse for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated currents in SPNs et al these responses could more likely be mediated by glutamate glutamate transporters are enriched in subsets of ChIs et al Stensrud et al and glutamate released from ChIs in the dorsal striatum can induce fast excitatory responses in striatal interneurons et al Nelson et al and in SPNs et al Cholinergic signaling in the striosome and matrix compartments is disrupted in slices taken from mice engaged in stereotypy Normally electrically evoked dopamine release is slightly higher in the matrix than in striosomes and Cragg Salinas et al but in mice in which striosomal neurons are identifiable by the ratio is reversed by acute application of cocaine to the brain slices et al These findings in striatal slices suggest that cocaine disrupts local circuits that maintain the baseline ratio of dopamine signaling In brain slices from rats and mice neurokinin receptor agonists have differential effects on evoked dopamine release in the striosomes and matrix and these agonist effects are partially affected by cholinergic blockade et al Brimblecombe and Cragg Part of the effect might also be mediated by interneurons and Cragg which tend to lie near striosomal borders The possibility that striatal interneurons might mediate direct communication is further supported by the finding that striatal injection of an toxin ablates ChIs and interneurons and causes a disruption to the pattern of heightened induction in striosomes induced by dopamine agonists et al We have found that ChIs do indeed modulate of striosomal and matrix neurons in mice and that this modulation is severely blunted in slices taken from mice treated with a schedule of that induces an imbalance in the ratio of expression Repeated exposure to psychomotor stimulants strongly impacts ChI signaling in the dorsal striatum et al including partial inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated dopamine release as measured by cyclic voltammetry in slices et al This effect may be a compensatory response to of the dopamine system considering that ChIs drive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated dopamine release et al Cachope et al Threlfell et al Consistently application reduces electrically evoked dopamine release in both striosome and matrix compartments et al We confirmed that optogenetic stimulation induced a spike in ChIs in slices from mice but we did not examine whether baseline ChI firing rates or acetylcholine release were impaired Thus whether the signaling defects are or or both remains to be tested Regardless of the mechanism if signaling from ChIs to SPNs is important for responsiveness to salient cues one consequence of cholinergic signaling could be a loss of normal engagement with the environment When the ChI signaling across striosome and matrix compartments breaks down under drug intoxication behavioral flexibility and cue responsiveness could be lost Author contributions CL and FW conducted all recording experiments JC and CG generated mouse crosses and

been the core of plant improvement in recent decades Efforts have been made to develop in planta transformation systems due to the limitations present in the methods Herein we report an improved in planta transformation system and provide the evidence of reporter gene expression in pollen tube embryos and stable transgenicity of the plants following plant transformation with optimized sonication treatment of pollen The results showed that the aeration at treatment of pollen grains in sucrose prior to sonication significantly improved the pollen viability leading to improved kernel set and transformation efficiency Scanning electron microscopy observation revealed that the removal of operculum covering pollen pore by ultrasonication might be one of the reasons for the pollen grains to become competent for transformation Evidences have shown that the eGfp gene was expressed in the pollen tube and embryos and the gene was detected in the subsequent T and T progenies suggesting the successful transfer of the foreign genes to the recipient plants The Southern blot analysis of gene in T progenies and Apr gene segregation in T seedlings confirmed the stable inheritance of the transgene The outcome illustrated that the genetic transformation system can be widely applied in the plant improvement programs with apparent advantages over transformation methods transformation sonication eGfp Zea mays Introduction Genetic transformation has become an important tool in the improvement of plants Numerous genetic transformation methods have been developed in the past three decades for a wide range of plant species Generally they have been classified into indirect or direct transformation Rao et al Biological methods using bacteria or viruses are referred to as indirect while direct methods are basically in physical ways that is by the penetration of the cell wall Torney et al Rivera et al Ziemienowicz et al At present two transformation methods are most commonly used in plants i e Agrobacterium transformation and particle bombardment Although widely used in the research community these methods have a common disadvantage i e the requirement of a long and laborious plant tissue culture process which is highly and costly Birch Ioannidis et al As some plant species or varieties are difficult to regenerate through tissue culture the applications of these methods have been restricted to some extent Furthermore the occurrence of somatic variation and low survival rate of some regenerated plantlets during transplanting process make the already low transformation efficiency further compromised Despite of some reports on transformation approaches independent of tissue culture these methods have not been applied efficiently in practice due to the complexity to operate and low efficiency Therefore transformation methods without tissue culture procedure and simple to operate are needed The interest in developing culture based or in planta transformation methods has been growing Shou et al The production of transgenic plants in such way could in general be relatively simple inexpensive and efficient Although being independent of tissue culture and having been used for many years floral dipping method is confined to only a few species that also restricted its wider application in many other plant species Clough and Bent It has been considered therefore that the reproductive system of plants is a potential pathway for the introduction of foreign genes Luo and Wu Attempts have been made to develop culture based transformation in plants in the last three decades Ohta Booy et al Li et al Pollen tube genetic transfer was reported in genetic transformation in cotton Zhou et al and rice Luo and Wu This method was once regarded advantageous due to its independency of tissue culture and plant regeneration no requirement on labs and its simplicity to operate However the transformation efficiency of this method has been proven low and thus requires massive transformant selection efforts among a large number of progenies and the method was not reproducible at least in some cases Shou et al Furthermore Booy et al demonstrated that the digestion of plasmid DNA by nuclease was a major obstacle for using pollen grains as vector for genetic transformation It has been suggested that the ultrasonication treatment of pollen grains denatures the nuclease while not completely inhibiting their viability and germination and a genetic transformation approach using plant pollen as a vector was reported Wang et al In the method pollen grains are targeted as a vector to carry foreign genes with the assistance of sonication treatments in a sucrose solution Genes of interest were then incorporated to the progenies by pollination process with the treated pollen and subsequent selection of genetically transformed seedlings transformation is a quick and easy alternative method to generate transgenic plants bypassing the requisite for tissue culture It has a potential to produce genetically modified plants within a short period leading to inclusion of the method in conventional crop breeding programs The method has also been proven applicable in sorghum Wang et al and Brassica Wang et al Nevertheless a major shortcoming of the then reported method showed low kernel setting rate after pollination because most pollen grains lose their viability after ultrasonication and fail to complete the fertilization process Further evidences of transformation in the following procedures for example during pollen germination and embryo development were lacking to support the success of transformation was due to the transformation of pollen grains Therefore improved kernel setting rate and further evidences to demonstrate the transformation of pollen grains as vectors have become desirable for wider application of such method We hypothesize that low temperature and aeration may be beneficial for maintaining pollen viability during sonication process as pollen is active in metabolisms which requires large amount of oxygen and temperature may rise Therefore we tested the effects of aeration and low temperature treatment to the sucrose solution prior to transformation of pollen grains Further we also hypothesize that foreign gene transformed to generative cell sperms will be incorporated to zygote through fertilization of egg by the sperm with transgene and then passed on to the progeny Herein we report an optimized plant transformation method that demonstrated effectiveness of the transformation of foreign genes by their expression at various stages Materials and Methods Plant Materials Maize inbred and obtained from Qiangsheng Seed Ltd Shanxi China were used throughout the study The plants were grown at an isolated experimental plot in the Experimental Research Station of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences Taiyuan China and tassels of recipient maize plants were removed before anthesis to keep a condition Pollen donor maize plants were grown in another experimental plot which was more than m apart from the recipient The seeds were sown in early May and corn ears were harvested in early October each year with sufficient irrigation when needed The field management was carried out according to the guideline provided for the breed Transformation Vectors Two constructs plasmid harboring a bar gene as a selector and a gene kindly provided by Lian et al and plasmid harboring an ampicillin resistant gene Apr as a selector and an eGfp gene gifted by Moeller

Treatment The Pollen Collection In order to be able to harvest desirable quality of fresh pollen old anthers were removed and the tassels were bagged in the afternoon the day prior to the collection On the collection day fresh pollen grains were collected into a paper bag between by shaking the tassels The collection was sieved to remove anthers and the pollen grains were used immediately for the downstream treatments or preserved in Petri dishes placed in a chamber at until required Aeration and Temperature Treatment Optimize for Pollen Grains A factorial design was performed to test the effect of aeration and temperature treatments on pollen viability and germination capability The factors were aeration treatment min or min and temperature or Here the group with min aeration and temperature at was regarded as an experimental control A total of g sieved pollen was suspended in ml of sterilized sucrose solution in a beaker The suspension was aerated by an air pump Figure for desired time at desired temperature as indicated previously as the treatments Approximately of the pollen suspension or equivalent to pollen grains g maize pollen Miller was allocated to a small Petri dish cm in to examine the germination rates by incubation for h at Pollen intactness and pollen tube growth were observed with an optical microscope Olympus Osaka Eight replications were taken with pollen grains for each image FIGURE Aeration treatment of sucrose solution for suspending maize pollen Sieved pollen was suspended in sterilized sucrose solution in a beaker and the suspension was aerated by an air pump for min prior to ultrasonication treatment Sonication Treatment The best combination of aeration time and temperature showing optimal pollen intactness germination rate and pollen tube growth was applied to pollen suspension before a sonication then the pollen grains were treated with an ultrasonic homogenizer Scientz Biotechnology Co Ltd China Frequency by submerging the probe of the homogenizer into the pollen suspension The power of the ultrasonic homogenizer was set to W and the sonication lasted for s each time with an interval of s for a total of six times Ten microgram of plasmid DNA W W of DNA was added to the treated pollen suspension and then sonicated again as described above All the sonication procedures were performed on ice to protect DNA and pollen contents from being degraded or damaged Untreated pollen mixed with plasmid DNA was used as control Pollination The treated pollen suspension was incubated at room temperature for min following the ultrasonication to let the pollen grains to sediment and the supernatant was then carefully discarded The pollen mass obtained was gently brushed onto the silks of recipients The pollinated ears were then bagged to protect stray pollen contamination The mature ears were harvested and the seeds were collected and stored at room temperature until they were sown in the following year Approximately one thousand maize ears were pollinated and harvested for each treatment and seed setting were recorded for each ear Transformant Screening In contrast to the transformation of somatic cells we define the primary transgenic kernels as T kernels and the seedlings from the kernels are T plants Harvested T kernels were sown in the field as described At leaf stage fresh leaves from T seedlings were collected plants pollinated with or sprayed with herbicide Basta L to select survived plants plants pollinated with plasmid DNA and total DNA was extracted with CTAB method for subsequent molecular analysis Doyle Scanning Electron Microscopy Pollen grains from sonication and control groups were fixed in glutaraldehyde solution phosphate and kept at until further processing

the foreign genes were transformed through transformation method following ultrasonication treatment and expressed in the pollen tubes embryos and progenies after transformation with the optimization of the treatment by aeration for min at Male sexual reproduction system is an ideal pathway for genetic transformation In animals use of reproductive system in transgenic manipulation has been performed more than two decades ago Wagner and Hoppe and lately such gene transfer technique has been widely used in different animals including livestock Nagano et al Oatley et al In plants attempts to use pollen as a pathway for genetic transformation have been reported by Kumlehn et al and Shim et al However an efficient way for the production of transgenic plants that can be widely applied in the breeding program is needed The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of transformation elucidated the possible mechanisms underlying the transformation and presented evidences of such transformation at molecular and histological levels These suggest that the method has a potential role in plant improvement due to its merits i e bypassing tissue culture procedure simple to operate and flexible in its applications in different species and varieties Ultrasonication has been used in a few studies to treat tissues or protoplasts for easy access to the genome of recipients by foreign DNA molecules in plants Zhang et al Joersbo and Brunstedt Wang et al Zhang et al and animals Bao et al Miller et al Huber and Pfisterer Hirabayashi et al It has been proposed that ultrasonic waves produce high pressure and high temperature lead to the localized rupture of cell wall and thus enhance permeability of the plasma membrane Liu et al Wang et al They also suggested transient cavitation produced by sonication may have enhanced the entry of foreign DNA into pollen Here we demonstrated with scanning electrical microscopy that the operculum covering the pollen germination pore was removed by ultrasonication and at least in some pollen grains this made them become more competent to receive foreign DNA We observed the expression of eGfp in the major part of the pollen tube This at least indicates the transgenicity of the vegetative cell We also found that the expression of eGfp in pollen tube appeared to restrict to the tip of pollen tube where vegetative nucleus resides along with the two sperm cells We are unable to distinguish whether eGfp is expressed in the vegetative cell or the generative sperm cells or both Since the vegetative nucleus does not contribute to the zygote formation we suggest that the transmission of foreign genes such as eGfp and to T and T generations is likely through the generative sperm cells given that these cells directly contribute to the formation of the zygote Eventually the transgene is passed onto the progeny by the kernel containing embryo developed from the zygote as evidenced by the eGfp expression in T embryos and gene presence in the leaves of T plants These transformed pollen grains perform as vectors to introduce exotic genetic materials into the genome of recipient plants following pollination and fertilization of theirs eggs To the best of our knowledge this is the first direct evidence to show how sonication acts on its biological target to make it permeable to allow the uptake of DNA molecules from the surrounding solution Furthermore this also indicates that the presence of pollen pore might be the reason to enable pollen to be used as a vector to mediate genetic transformation despite its presence of protective exine wall To understand the underlying mechanisms of this transformation system more thoroughly subsequent studies are warranted to investigate the process how the foreign genes are transferred to generative sperm cells employing for instance labeling at scanning electron microscopy or TEM level what is the frequency of such transformation relative to that to vegetative cell and the possible copy numbers of genes transferred to the generative sperm cells through and genetic approaches In the present study optimal of pollen grains by aeration of min at was applied as the aeration and low temperature led to better pollen viability and kernel set We also observed that fresh pollen could be better kept with the presence of drierite Such improved pollen grain viability may have helped to some extent the introduction of foreign genes into the recipients due to higher successful pollination and thus improved kernel set during the experiment Although we used field grown plants as pollen donors in the study we observed that pollen viability can largely be maintained as long as pollen is collected in clear days according to our previous experiences over years Therefore the method is fairly robust and can be readily used by the breeders who do not have expensive greenhouse facilities Nevertheless the efficiency of the method can be improved under controlled conditions The transformation system developed by our group has been proved effective in delivering foreign genes to directly generate transgenic kernels without using tissue culture procedures The optimization of treatment conditions to pollen grains prior to sonication makes it more efficient This system has many advantages over traditional tissue transformation system i e its simplicity fast turnaround low costs so that breeders can utilize such transformation system in their breeding program without excessive efforts of training and need of expensive equipment We believe this transformation system is a promising tool and will play an important role in plant breeding area Author Contributions LY performed SEM and fluorescence microscopy observations with eGfp

Preparedness Transplant Springer Media New York specter of nuclear terrorism still threatens us all Barack Obama June address to the US Air Force Academy The Radiation Injury Treatment Network began with the ambitious vision to provide a resource to help with the surge of casualties following a mass casualty incident with marrow toxic injuries This continues to be a lofty goal that the RITN strives for but the gap between where we were following the tragedy of and today is significantly smaller The National Marrow Donor Program has had the great fortune to have a grant from the Office of Naval Research to conduct research to improve outcomes from hematopoietic transplantation As part of this grant there has been a item to conduct contingency planning in preparedness for a national disaster This effort was fulfilled for a few years then the efforts were greatly accelerated following The NMDP began by holding focus sessions with Hematology and Oncology physicians that were part of the network of transplant centers These meetings led to the close partnership with the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation which broadened the audience and helped to continue to engage those who would be involved in a response These focus groups surveys and meetings culminated in the formation of the Radiation Injury Treatment Network in with the commitment of blood and bone marrow transplant units at NMDP affiliated hospitals cancer centers Hematology and oncology teams have extensive expertise in caring for patients that have been purposefully exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation The resulting complications can be directly correlated to the care needed for a radiation casualty suffering from Acute Radiation Syndrome resulting from exposure to an ionizing radiation A radiological disaster could be as catastrophic as the detonation of an improvised nuclear device nuclear or a less devastating incident such as a radiological exposure device radiological source placed in a public a radiological dispersal device k a a dirty bomb where a conventional explosive spreads radiological a nuclear power plant accident or a mustard agent incident Regardless of the incident there will be casualties that require specialized supportive care to salvage their damaged hematopoietic systems From these small beginnings the group would debate the focus vision and even the name of what would become the RITN culminating in with the signing of the first contracts This was no easy task as initially the language stated the hospitals would accept patients from a radiological disaster which the hospital administration and legal staff expressed concern over After going a few rounds of review with each hospital language that was strong enough to show commitment yet flexible enough to appease the lawyers solidified The sales pitch to new institutions was a repeat of selling the pros of imagine asking a senior administrator at a hospital if they would like to join a group of hospitals preparing to receive casualties from the detonation of a nuclear device Needless to say there was some pushback However fortunately for RITN the physicians we worked with were passionate and persuasive Since those humble beginnings RITN has grown into a conglomeration of cancer treatment centers hospitals blood donor centers and cord blood banks as of late The hospitals cancer centers and the physicians that led the charge at the initial cohort of cancer centers that joined RITN should be recognized for

appealed to each sense of greater good as well as offered a token stipend to offset some of the costs this grant did not cover the cost of staff time fully but at least eased the sting To help with this effort the funds were provided through a fee for service agreement to reduce the restrictions on how they could be used However to ensure that we were our monies worth we began assigning annual tasks These included the development of a standard operating procedure incorporation of the RITN acute radiation syndrome treatment guidelines training conducting an exercise and testing the satellite telephone and emergency calling card Emergency Telecommunications that were issued to each center To ease this burden we developed the training and exercise so that each center could readily apply them with minimal effort We still ask each center to accomplish similar tasks each however we have added a dozen training options so that it does not get stale and broadens the perspective on impact on a local center in the event of a nuclear disaster This initiative grew to include training emergency preparedness exercises and regular workshops bringing experts together to plan and prepare for a catastrophe that everyone hopes will never happen RITN has developed and made available to the public many of the resources developed over the past years to improve preparedness including training materials disaster exercises drills materials treatment guidelines medical order sets for adult and pediatric patients and referral guidelines All of these are available on the RITN website for open use by the providing recognition is given to RITN as the source Since the RITN has assisted in the training of over medical and hospital support staff on training All of these materials are available for use and review on our public website including links to our free training MS PowerPoint slides are available to conduct training as needed to extend the effort Fig RITN training and education Since the inception of RITN exercises have been a part of the annual requirements for each hospital Each year RITN would develop a tabletop exercise where a disaster scenario would be reviewed by appropriate staff at the hospital and when appropriate with the emergency preparedness teams of the community They would then provide responses to questions on what they would have done in said situation These efforts grew to include functional exercises where portions of the response plans are acted out to exercises where mock casualties with moulage wound makeup ambulances and aircraft are mobilized for a close to realistic situation as possible All told over exercises have been coordinated or funded by RITN from to RITN does not want those who are planning an exercise to duplicate previous efforts so in addition to the after action reports from exercises explaining the lessons learned and gaps identified the full exercise planning and execution documents are posted for use on our website for general review Fig RITN exercises by year Hospitals preparing for a mass casualty incident require more than training and exercises tools are often requested and we have tried to meet these needs through the development of many resources These include the RITN ARS Treatment Guidelines RITN Hospital Referral Guidelines RITN Concept of Operations the Adult and Pediatric Medical Ordersets were developed in coordination with the Radiation Emergency Medical Management for implementation of a standard approach to patient care for those individuals who might experience an acute radiation illness RITN has come a long we still see many challenges need for continued growth of the network how to engage distant unused medical capacity through telemedicine and increasing awareness within the medical and public health community as well as many other local issues that are identified during the exercises we support However based on the great success we have seen to date we are confident that the Radiation Injury Treatment Network will continue to step up to the challenge presented mission and goals are as The Radiation Injury Treatment provides comprehensive evaluation and treatment for victims of radiation exposure or other marrow toxic injuries Many of the casualties with radiation injury will be salvageable but require outpatient and or inpatient care Recognizing this the US National Marrow Donor Program US Navy and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation collaboratively developed RITN which comprises of medical centers with expertise in the management of bone marrow failure stem cell donor centers and umbilical cord blood banks across the US The goals of RITN are as follows to develop treatment guidelines for managing hematologic toxicity among victims of radiation exposure to educate health care professionals about pertinent aspects of radiation exposure management to help coordinate the medical response to radiation events and to provide comprehensive evaluation and treatment for victims at participating centers Since RITNs inception it has been fortunate to have many partners including the support of the Office of Naval Research Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources Services Administration Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the

creation of world collections of key economic crops Through the efforts of its administrators and staff the foundation subsequently parlayed this experience into a leadership role in international efforts to conserve plant genetic resources Previous accounts of the Rockefeller interventions in international agricultural development have focused on the outcomes prioritized by foundation staff and administrators as they launched assistance programs and especially their characterization of the peoples and they encountered abroad This paper highlights instead how foundation administrators and staff responded to a newly emergent international agricultural loss of crop genetic diversity Charting the responses to this concern which developed only after agricultural modernization had begun and was understood to be produced by the successes of the own agricultural assistance programs allows for greater interrogation of how the foundation understood and projected its central position in international agricultural research activities by the Keywords Rockefeller Foundation Seed banks Crop diversity Plant genetic resources Green Revolution Agricultural modernization Rockefeller Archive Center Springer International Publishing AG Introduction In the Rockefeller Foundation launched a program in Mexico that aimed to increase agricultural production through greater research and training in the agricultural sciences Many scholars have looked to this effort as the starting point of the Green is of the striking increase seen in the production of certain economic crops in Latin America and Asia in the late and that resulted especially from the introduction of crop varieties and the agricultural technologies and financial structures needed to cultivate these Perkins Cotter Harwood Cullather Patel In establishing this narrative historians have traced the efforts from Mexico across Latin America in the and to India Pakistan and elsewhere in Asia in the and and finally to Africa where these faltered in the and later Fitzgerald Matchett Cullather Shepherd Smith Baranski The outcomes of these activities remain contested hailed by some as having prevented global food crises and decried by others as the source of innumerable social and environmental problems Much of the historical literature that has evaluated the agricultural assistance programs of the Rockefeller Foundation from the onward has focused on the outcomes that were vigorously pursued from the outset These include especially the creation and dissemination of varieties of key economic crops and the broad political agendas such as transforming potentially volatile peasants into cooperative capitalist farmers that were encoded in seemingly narrow breeding efforts Some of these studies have explored how the prior experiences and assumptions of foundation officers and staff affected what they defined as problems worthy of attention in the countries they visited as well as the solutions they proposed g Fitzgerald Shepherd Smith Nally and Taylor The perspectives of foundation officers about the need for agricultural assistance and the form it should take were not developed in isolation but reflected contemporary theories of economic development and were bound closely to US geopolitical concerns and strategies for national security in the midst of the Cold these too have been consistent themes in studies of the Rockefeller agricultural programs g Oasa Perkins Cullather Although it complements these many studies the history that I relate here differs in its approach to understanding the agricultural programming of the Rockefeller Foundation and its effects I explore a component of the interventions in global participation in the collection and preservation of genetic diversity in agricultural was not prompted by the perceived shortcomings of agriculturists or governments but instead arose as a means of managing some less desirable consequences of the own activities As I describe here in the decades following the launch of the agricultural program in Mexico in the Rockefeller Foundation figured prominently in the creation of collections in which many thousands of varieties of important economic crops were gathered I show how through the efforts of its administrators and staff the foundation subsequently parlayed this experience into a leadership role in international efforts to conserve genetic as these coalesced in the late These activities have had for international agricultural research and development The institutions favored by the Rockefeller Foundation as centers of collection and conservation whose histories I recount here still play central roles in the management and global circulation of plant genetic materials especially for key economic crops such as rice maize and wheat The history of the Rockefeller involvement in the collection and maintenance of crop genetic diversity aligns with the existing scholarship in showing the influence of the resources and vision on crucial elements of agricultural production at local and global scales Yet because of the particular nature of the problem of the loss of genetically diverse types exploring this history allows for greater interrogation of how the foundation embodied in its came to understand and position itself as an undisputed authority in international agricultural research This is because the loss of genetically diverse types became an urgent international concern only after agricultural modernization had begun and was in fact understood to be produced by the very successes of the agricultural programs Here the problem to be solved could not be explained by reference to the failures of backwards farming communities or addressed by imposing an imported vision of good agriculture It was acknowledged to be a product of the own activities more it invited the interest of other organizations who found themselves engaged in resolving an issue seen to be exacerbated by agricultural modernization as pursued by the Rockefeller Foundation As a result this history offers an opportunity to consider how the foundation viewed its authority in the domain of global agriculture that of other national and international actors Mexican maize diversity The Rockefeller first forays into the collection of crop plant diversity in the were intended not as conservation activities but rather as the initial steps towards specific agricultural objectives the creation and distribution of crop plants for Mexican farmers Within a few short years however concerns about the potential loss of the diverse types of maize found in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America transformed a working is one used for the immediate research needs of breeders and other scientists on a resource to be expanded and stewarded for the future In October the Rockefeller Foundation entered into an agreement with the Mexican government in which it agreed to provide Mexico with technical expertise in agricultural research with the aim of improving national agricultural productivity via a new Office of Special Studies in the Ministry of Agriculture It followed that a top priority for this office was to establish programs in plant breeding as the development of varieties of important economic and subsistence crops like maize wheat and beans promised a straightforward route to increased agricultural production One of the first activities to be undertaken in the program which was directed by the American geneticist and breeder Edwin Wellhausen was to establish a collection of locally adapted Mexican maize varieties called The stated purpose of collecting was to support the maize improvement however it was further encouraged by more academic interests As a consultant to the Rockefeller Foundation the Harvard botanist and maize breeder Paul Mangelsdorf had been instrumental first in shaping the Mexican program then in launching the Office of Special Studies and setting an agenda for its maize program He had also been engaged in the study of evolutionary origins for a number of years work in which he relied on varieties gathered from across the Americas His passion for both breeding and evolutionary studies influenced subsequent ambitions for and uses of the collection Foundation staff made the first collections of maize while driving across the Mexican countryside According to Wellhausen they gathered many varieties along the road as we went from one place to another Over time the collecting activities became more methodical Wellhausen was soon dispatching students from the nearby university to gather maize from all corners of the country They were provided with and tags and money to and relied on buses and sometimes burros to travel to what Wellhausen called hinterlands Once they had arrived at remote sites collectors often faced a still more difficult task Collecting diverse types of maize frequently meant negotiating with impoverished farmers for access to a precious resource The persistence paid off In when the collections had only just begun Wellhausen reported the large of more than maize types held by the Office of Special Studies By the collection included some varieties of and Wellhausen and his colleagues encouraged by Mangelsdorf had begun an effort to classify these and definitively establish their relationships to one another Almost from the outset those associated with the Office of Special Studies recognized that their program if it were successful would produce more desirable strains of maize that might well replace the many diverse types they now encountered in Mexican fields This loss would be a blow to breeding efforts and botanical studies alike When Wellhausen and his colleagues published the results of their classificatory effort they both acknowledged this concern and assigned themselves a central role in addressing it modern corn has a responsibility not only to improve the maize in the country in which he works but also to recognize to describe and to preserve for future use the varieties and races which his own improved productions tend to replace and in some cases to et al As it turned out this notion was more widely shared In the German geneticist Friedrich Brieger of the Universidade de Paulo voiced his concern over the likely disappearance of maize varieties across the Americas to the botanist Ralph Cleland who was then the chairman of the Division of Biology and Agriculture of the US National Research Council dire predictions of varieties being lost within ten years inspired Cleland to assess interest in a conservation effort among his colleagues and potential funders Within a couple of years a small group of US scientists had formed a on the Preservation of Indigenous Strains of Maize under the auspices of the NRC Curry Its initial members included a number of botanists and geneticists including Mangelsdorf whose research had already sparked their interest in maize diversity Convinced of the likely loss of varieties resulting from the introduction of improved lines members of the Maize Committee obtained a grant from the US Technical Cooperation Administration to finance a hemispheric effort to collect and preserve these imperiled varieties Their arguments for why an agency concerned with offering to developing countries should support their work emphasized the essential role that the endangered varieties would play in future efforts across Latin however they also called attention to the benefits to US agriculture and to scientific research The Maize Committee relying especially on Mangelsdorf as an intermediary also sought to secure the aid of the Rockefeller Foundation on the ground in Latin America J George Harrar the director of the program in Mexico and his colleagues clearly saw the value of the Maize work for their future activities As Harrar argued to the foundation president Chester Bernard importance of maintaining viable germplasm of native crop plants such as corn is obvious and of tremendous significance in the development of new varieties of corn to meet future problems He pointed out that the foundation had been doing this work for years spending considerable sums in the creation of a maize collection in Mexico and more recently in Colombia where a second Latin American program had been launched in They were in his assessment in possession of unparalleled resources we accept the proposal of the NRC committee we will immediately make available to them the most important maize material now in existence Bernard agreed with Harrar but expressed reservations that the committee had not adequately considered the question of maintaining these varieties in the He worried that this expensive commitment would devolve to the foundation and insisted that the foundation not commit itself to providing for the indefinite maintenance of the collected maize On that understanding the Rockefeller Foundation signed on to the Maize planned program Over the next few years the foundation supervised collecting missions and provided land and space for multiplying and renewing collected seeds The NRC using the grant from the TCA paid for equipment supplies travel expenses and salaries associated with collecting TCA funds also supported the creation of three storage centers to house the in Mexico Colombia and additional storage at a US Department of Agriculture site in Maryland Both the Mexican and Colombian centers were linked to Rockefeller Foundation operations The Mexican storage facility was at Chapingo the field site of the Office of Special Studies and home to earlier maize collections while the Colombian storage facility was sited at the new Rockefeller Foundation outpost in The Maize Committee quickly achieved its goal of amassing seeds of diverse types By the committee claimed a total of samples of maize from across the Americas of which had been officially catalogued and many thousands of which were duplicated in storage This success created new problems as the question of maintenance and renewal of these collections in Latin America lingered Although the Maize Committee had hoped to establish an endowment to support the storage centers in perpetuity no donor materialized In a heated exchange of foundation staff including Harrar took great offense at the Maize their cavalier assumption outlined in a further grant proposal that the foundation would go on maintaining and distributing the collected maize varieties at its own expense Yet this is what eventually happened New crops new collections new concerns During the Rockefeller Foundation staff continued to emphasize the importance of collections of crop diversity to the success of crop improvement programs and increasingly saw a clear role for the foundation in maintaining these collections This was due in part to the sponsorship of a greater number of agricultural initiatives As it expanded its horizons from Mexico and Colombia to all of Latin America and then to South and Southeast Asia and beyond the foundation generated a need for access to more and different crops Perhaps more important as staff members from the flagship Mexico program fanned out to these new sites they brought with them a sense of the important role that the collection of diverse varieties had played in the successes of the Mexican they endeavored to repeat that experience In in the midst of the maize collecting efforts in Latin America the Rockefeller Foundation entered into an agreement with the Government of India to create a cooperative research program at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi As the program got off the ground in and a initiative was the first to be established followed shortly by an effort to improve sorghum and millets pp Kenneth Rachie formerly of the Office of Special Studies in Mexico led the latter project He immediately proposed collecting sorghum varieties just as collections of corn germ had been made in Latin America is quite obvious that such collections played an important part in excellent development of maize improvement programs in Mexico and Colombia he noted Although Rachie envisioned that Indian materials would be the starting point for the collections he hoped that from other countries would be added and eventually a world sorghum bank would be established Rachie considered this to be in the known remit of the foundation of world germplasm banks has been an important function of the Rockefeller Foundation agricultural programs in the past Rachie soon organized an collecting program in which Indian collectors sought out locally adapted varieties of sorghum maize and millets He further supplemented the collection with materials from other institutions as well as a sorghum collection that he had brought with him from Mexico to create his envisioned p A similar tale unfolded beginning in at a different institution the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines Jointly funded by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and directed initially by a former staff member of the Office of Special Studies mission was to raise rice production across Asia through enhanced scientific research and training As with the program in Mexico breeding varieties took center stage And as with the earlier maize and sorghum efforts rice breeding began with an effort to assemble at IRRI as many rice varieties as possible Because many agricultural institutions already possessed large collections of rice varieties the primary method of collecting was to write to these institutions to see whether they would share their materials By the end of the collection included nearly accessions and had benefited from the donation of extensive materials from the USDA the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Japan and Taiwan pp The brief overviews of the collecting programs offered of maize in the Americas and sorghum maize and millets in little sense of the labor and resources required to assemble and maintain a collection of diverse crop varieties even for a circumscribed region To gather the sorghum maize and millet varieties of India Rachie relied on seven lead field collectors from India Prior to visiting any area Rachie and his collaborators had to gather information about the nature and location of crops likely to be found there as well as the predicted time of they also had to contact local agricultural officials and receive permission and in many cases assistance to carry out the work of collecting Taking a sample involved gathering the seeds wrapping these in cloth and bagging them completing a standardized data form in duplicate packing the bags into further metal containers or burlap bags and sending these back to New Delhi As Rachie summarized collecting was found to be hard exhausting work The collectors nonetheless accumulated samples of sorghum of maize and of varied spent a collective days in the field and an additional days planning the missions and having traveled an estimated miles while in the field Collecting was indeed hard exhausting work But in many respects maintenance proved harder still It was only after seeds arrived at a storage facility that the tasks of maintenance seeds for storage classifying the accessions developing a system for tracking these and storing data growing out seeds to regenerate stocks making samples available to breeders worldwide and so on An illustration of just how difficult maintenance proved is the history of the Latin American maize collection in the mid This collection had been shepherded by the Rockefeller Foundation from the days of the Maize Committee through the closing of the Office of Special Studies in and then the inauguration of a new Maize Improvement Program the same year As institutional histories proudly note the collection held by this latter program became the core material for the of a new International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize established in under an agreement between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Government et al But what was the collection like at that time As Mario the scientist hired to curate the CIMMYT genebank later described CIMMYT had in could not be classified as a bank but merely as a dump Seeds produced for the bank sat idly in tin cans awaiting proper storage the refrigeration equipment was broken and within the cold rooms disorganization reigned According to true inventory existed and staff members had to spend sometimes as much as a week trying to locate the seed they wished Collecting therefore was only the in some sense the comparatively easy a much more arduous task Though the collections may not have been as perfect as their originators would have wished them to be and the task of maintenance an ongoing challenge in the the international agricultural research institutes and and the agricultural program in India had some of the most comprehensive collections of varietal diversity in key economic crops found anywhere in world The Rockefeller Foundation as patron had played a central role in bringing these into being An international gene bank and the World Germplasm Project While programs supported by the Rockefeller Foundation were accumulating massive numbers of varieties of select crops for the primary not use of agricultural researchers affiliated with these programs a growing number of breeders botanists and other biologists had begun to make calls for more and more extensive such collections The saw increasing agitation for international efforts to gather and protect in perpetuity the vast genetic diversity in agricultural not just a few key crops but a wide range of species important to human social and economic activities These calls prompted Rockefeller Foundation staff to develop for the first time an overarching vision for the role in stewarding collections of crop varieties and to articulate a position on this newly international and now more strongly issue What was behind this heightened concern for crop diversity One short answer is the work of the international agricultural research institutes and other development initiatives By encouraging farmers to transition to varieties as part of a larger package of agricultural change programs such as the those of the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico and India and institutions like CIMMYT and IRRI were seen as having expedited a transition away from the use of genetically diverse landraces that agriculturists had noted and worried about since the century For some observers these worries were further stimulated by a more general concern about ecological as a Dutch agricultural official described in is not only a matter of agriculture and developing countries but also a matter the concern of so many people today with our environment Of those organizations that responded to concern about the loss of genetic diversity in crop plants two of the most important were FAO and an international research initiative called the International Biological Programme It was members of an IBP committee who first produced a categorization of threatened and indicated priorities for conservation within these Hoping to transform their assessment into action at least in the realm of agriculture IBP members reached out to FAO and Bennett Pistorius ch Founded in October as a permanent UN agency in the domain of food and agriculture FAO had played a role in the coordination of plant exploration and the creation of global catalogues of varieties of major food crops since the late The joint efforts of the IBP and FAO led to a FAO IBP Technical Conference on the Exploration Utilization and Conservation of Plant Genetic Resources the aims of which were to chart conservation concerns related to genetic resources survey current activities and create a plan of action for the future and Bennett Pistorius ch The plan elaborated at the conference was focused on stemming the perceived tide of losses The first step would be to produce a survey of resources in the is an assessment of the location and extent of and the wild relatives of crops considered useful as potential breeding This global survey coordinated through a central agency would in turn serve as a guide for collecting the plants identified Another survey would chart existing collections at institutions throughout the world All of these genetic resources would then be classified evaluated documented and conserved for the long term The key recommendation of the conference was the creation or designation of seed storage facilities in particular an gene available to all nations Finally bringing all of these linked elements together would necessitate coordination and oversight Having agreed that this only come from United Nations agency the summary indicated that FAO and its Unit on Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources and Genetic Resources Information Centre would be the obvious choice and Bennett pp Although FAO may have seemed the logical institution to nominate as coordinating body for these activities its status as a UN agency and mandate to improve food and agricultural production worldwide did not translate into clear international authority and effectiveness The early ambitions for FAO to address world hunger through direct measures such as the reorganization of commodity markets emergency food relief and credit schemes to foster agricultural development were forestalled especially by British and US policymakers US officials in particular wanted to promote free markets and in the midst of the Cold War retain the use of food aid as means of influencing leaders of developing nations and fostering goodwill abroad As a result FAO never received the funding or powers it needed to tackle hunger and its role in its early decades was limited largely to offering technical assistance and compiling statistics and Di Blase Staples In the late limited financial resources and authority remained a constraint on FAO activities Although it had increased its operational programming its technical assistance remained according to one historical assessment in comparison to other particularly bilateral of such assistance and Di Blase p Perhaps equally troublesome for the proposals of the conference these years represented a period of transition at FAO A multifaceted campaign against hunger begun in the early was curtailed in favor of a narrower focus on scientific and technical assistance and under new leadership FAO restructured both its internal organization and its programming priorities and Di Blase pp Staples p In the midst of these changes the ambitious conservation agenda articulated at the FAO IBP Technical Conference and envisioned as a task for FAO remained on paper even as interest in the issue of plant genetic resources continued to mount in both national and international circles Confronted by this growing international concern which not only emerged from the Rockefeller past activities but also potentially threatened its future work foundation administrators moved to position themselves and their agricultural institutes as the most knowledgeable and effective agents in managing global crop diversity However they characterized this issue not as one of general conservation action intended foremost to prevent a cascade of losses in crop species and their wild relatives but rather as a targeted need to locate and make available to breeders increasingly rare of major crops The director of the agricultural sciences program Sterling Wortman offered a first formal assessment in March the past years The Rockefeller Foundation has contributed to science and to world agriculture by assisting in the collection storage and evaluation of the basic food wheat rice sorghum and the millets Wortman noted Yet further work remained to be done to collection and evaluation in these crops the indigenous varieties are further displaced by newer types Wortman suggested that it would take two years for a group of experts to generate a status report on existing collections worldwide which would then serve as a guide for gathering what diversity remained He further indicated that the established international agricultural institutes g CIMMYT and would be central hubs for these activities organizing the collections and ensuring their availability to scientists who can make best use of them Why was such an effort required of the Rockefeller Foundation Subsequent summaries emphasized that the successes had drawn on collections of genetic diversity and that future efforts would depend on similar resources attained through the use genetically diverse resources have been spectacular particularly in rice wheat and maize summarized one proposal referring to the programs in Latin America and Asia maintain the achieved high levels of production of these and for the improvement of other basic food crops we are entirely dependent on the availability of material in the germplasm banks Another important reason for the foundation to develop an overarching plan for the management of crop diversity was a widespread perception that they had played a role in placing such resources at risk Even if it did not come up explicitly in many foundation reports and proposals it always lurked between the lines How could it not when one of the most common examples offered to indicate the urgency of creating new collections was the spread of the wheat and rice varieties Foundation officers were well aware of this view As such the foundation was not just addressing an unfolding agricultural problem that it had the experience and resources to take on It was addressing a problem generated in part through its own activities Finally foundation officers may well have worried about other institutions encroaching on activities collection and maintenance of that were not only areas of extensive investment on the part of the foundation but also tasks central to the identity and importance of the agricultural research institutes Although Wortman and his colleagues recognized that cooperation with institutions such as FAO would be essential in any international germplasm conservation effort they tellingly did not reach out to these institutions in their initial planning Instead they dismissed them The consensus of an April meeting for example was that the FAO IBP proposals had arrived at a dead would on paper Empowered by their experiences in this field concerned about the future viability of their programs cognizant of their role in imperiling genetic resources and likely aiming to continue as leaders in a newly crowded enterprise those in the Rockefeller agricultural sciences program forged ahead In short order they nominated four expert each for maize rice wheat and sorghum and in turn assembled a group that he and Foundation staff considered the best qualified to collectively establish the status of existing collections gaps in these collections and plans needed to ensure and improved of global germplasm resources The summary statements to emerge from these efforts converged on a few themes The first was that many varieties were indeed in danger of disappearing and further collection activities should be undertaken A second was that oversight of collecting and maintenance should be done on a basis and in most cases left to the care of the established agricultural research institutes The wheat committee for example argued that CIMMYT because of its character and role as an international center of would be the logical institution to serve as the for the activities recommended by the committee Rather than attempt to build a centralized collection or even a centralized effort the committees generally agreed that each institute was best left to undertake independently the conservation efforts that its researchers felt most desirable In April the Rockefeller Foundation dedicated the comparatively modest sum of the costs of completing the collection of the world germplasm of corn wheat rice sorghum and millets stipulating that this was to be used within a period The assumed recipients of this grant money were IRRI work on CIMMYT wheat and an International Center for Research in the Tropics for sorghum and the and the Plant Introduction Research office of the USDA for collecting The limited plan for protecting formulated at the Rockefeller Foundation by was a far cry from the ambitious vision articulated at the FAO IBP Technical Conference a few years earlier It aimed at creating better collections of a handful of that because of their economic importance had already been the focus of Rockefeller Foundation collections and that were arguably best represented in national and other to do so within established institutions and without global oversight Its central objective was to ensure the availability of precious resources to breeders The FAO IBP vision on the other hand was not limited to the core commodity crops of global agriculture but instead articulated a need for widespread conservation action and furthermore emphasized the conservation aspects of the work over utilization It made a strong case for the creation of new institutions including regional seed banks and an international coordinating body Finally while the FAO IBP proposal aimed at the development of an effort with permanent institutional support and activities projected for the indefinite future foundation officers preferred to think that they were closing the door on this issue Wortman described the World Germplasm Project as systematic completion of the collection of the cereal grains CGIAR and the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources Although Rockefeller Foundation administrators expressed skepticism about the ability of FAO and IBP to follow through on the ambitious scheme articulated at the FAO IBP Technical Conference the promoters of that scheme had not lost hope In they laid their call for an internationally coordinated effort to conserve genetically diverse crops at the feet of a newly organized international body the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research describing it as a concern that threatened the entire future of agricultural development From until members of CGIAR an organization whose mandate was to coordinate international aid for agricultural research in developing countries grappled with the challenge of addressing this complex global conservation concern The origins of CGIAR much like the rising concern about resources lie in the Rockefeller escalating activities in the area of agricultural assistance In the the costs to the foundation well as its partner the Ford of operating the international agricultural research by included CIMMYT IRRI the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture rapidly Although the foundations wished to see these continue they did not envision themselves as permanent financial backers By they had initiated talks with various governments and international organizations seeking relief from the enormous financial obligations the institutes entailed These negotiations resulted in the formation of CGIAR the purpose of which was to coordinate research activities that addressed the agricultural needs of developing countries It worked primarily by directing funds from donors to the existing agricultural institutes creating new institutes organized on the same basic model and coordinating research efforts among all of these Secretariat Baum and Lejeune From the outset it was clear that the officials who gathered as CGIAR at regular meetings would need a source of scientific and technical advice in order to effectively coordinate research at an international level Its members therefore decided that CGIAR would have its own Technical Advisory Committee comprising twelve scientists with expertise in agriculture and development It was through this committee that the creation of a coordinated system to conserve crop plant diversity was presented to CGIAR as a pressing need for international agricultural research From the outset the most hotly contested element of proposed genetic conservation activities was the role that would be given to FAO The initial plan brought to the TAC in by staff of the Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources Unit of FAO called for the creation of eleven resources to collect and maintain crop varieties and a coordinating body that would be and supervised by internationally recognized experts staffed with trained personnel and provided access to to act as advisers FAO estimated the initial cost of to million to support eight or nine centers for a period It identified no new costs associated with the coordinating because it envisioned that the existing FAO Unit would assume them This latter assumption raised immediate objections As Otto Frankel a central figure in the FAO IBP Technical Conference and chair of an FAO of on plant exploration and conservation described FAO Unit concerned with genetic has a staff of three professional people who are overworked and would be wholly They have not barely much easier task of coordinating the work of those existing institutions which could now act as such a network Other CGIAR members shared concern about presumed leadership especially representatives of the Rockefeller Foundation As one foundation officer summarized the main points of difficulty arise from the fact that FAO would presume to bring under its control the coordinating body and there are serious reservations about the ability of FAO to develop the strategies for a comprehensive germplasm program Although FAO by virtue of its particular mandate seemed to him a logical institution to take on international coordination he felt that history in bureaucratic procedures and program execution leaves something to be desired assessment of course left aside the question of whether FAO had ever had the resources it needed to effectively carry out programming He and other administrators were quick to point out who did have such experience the Rockefeller Foundation Through its World Germplasm Project the foundation had begun to coordinate efforts among international those to which it was already closely order to gather and preserve crop diversity Foundation officers felt that these activities had not been adequately taken into account in discussions about the formation of a new genetic resources network In addition to questioning overall capacity for program management Rockefeller Foundation administrators raised concerns about its comparative weakness in more specialized areas of expertise These included in particular the technical enterprises of collecting and maintaining seed stocks To representatives of the foundation the creation of new genetic resources centers under FAO oversight would take control out of the hands of those with the most relevant experience In estimation only international research centers g CIMMYT can really implement plans including collection evaluation description and FAO can and would cooperate but its officers generally would agree that action should rest with institutes with FAO handling descriptions promotion of use of the resources and arrangements for cooperation in the evaluation of materials In summer after a number of TAC subcommittee meetings and several iterations of proposals a revised plan came from FAO to CGIAR for its consideration Surprisingly given the tenor of the meetings and negotiations that preceded it this proposal placed even greater control in the hands of FAO emphasized the limitations of the existing agricultural institutes and replaced a previously planned independent advisory panel of scientists with the FAO Panel of Experts Unsurprisingly Rockefeller Foundation representatives stridently objected Once again they couched their objections in terms of their previous experience seems to us that this is a scientific undertaking which must be controlled at all by the very best scientific judgment Wortman began the funds become available we find literally thousands of collections coming One can be dealing with a bottomless pit of collection if we do not have careful scientific control The implication was that FAO a political organization would not be in a position to manage competing demands for collection from varied national and regional entities By comparison the agricultural institutes with their scientific expertise and their prior experience in managing the of rolling in would be far better positioned In the wake of the proposal and ensuing discussions a subcommittee of CGIAR finally generated terms of reference and an operational plan for an International Board for Plant Genetic Resources that would be accepted by CGIAR At the first meeting of this subcommittee Lewis Roberts associate director of the Rockefeller Agricultural Sciences program propounded the views of the foundation He argued first that the focus of any effort should be relatively few crops that supply man with most of his primarily on the grounds of cost especially the cost of maintaining evaluating and sharing stocks very sharp focus of a global genetic resources program will be required in order to keep it from becoming so broad and unwieldy that it cannot be adequately financed or managed to ensure its success His second major bid was for a governing board a high degree of autonomy which he thought was not ensured in the proposal of an expanded FAO unit operating in conjunction with its own Panel of Experts According to account of the meeting his proposal won favor over one advanced by FAO representatives Roberts was subsequently asked to form a small together with members from UK and West Germany notably no one from to draft the terms of reference and plan of operation for the envisioned governing board Although FAO had announced its intention of expanding its Crop Ecology and Genetic Resources Unit so as to be able to coordinate international conservation efforts its central role in the finalized terms of reference was to provide a secretariat and maintain a trust fund for an independent board of experts who would be answerable primarily to CGIAR and its TAC The activities of the IBPGR were described as giving priority to of major economic importance and their wild and cultivated relatives In this work its chief collaborators would be the established international agricultural research institutes and several new institutions just then coming on line under the auspices of CGIAR which would be tasked with maintaining the core world collections of key economic crops such as maize wheat and rice In other words a narrow vision that supported established approaches to and institutions for agricultural development displaced the more encompassing FAO earlier IBP vision of advancing food security through the conservation of a broad range of crops and the distribution of this work and the resources necessary to support it to a range of national and international actors This outcome reflected a broader pattern that historians have identified at FAO that began in the late and became more apparent through early in which FAO lost its leadership on the issue of agricultural p see also Marchisio and Di Blase The proposal hammered out by Roberts and others on the was one that the Rockefeller Foundation was happy to support It provided initial funds that would be used larger donations from West Germany Sweden Netherlands and the United to get the new IBPGR up and running In addition spite of his concern in January that FAO was trying move in and take over major control of the by orchestrating the creation of a list of candidate members of invited to be among the initial twelve members assuring the foundation a voice in all of its early proceedings Conclusion Accounts by other scholars have ably demonstrated how the Rockefeller interventions in international agriculture were shaped by its and assessments of the kinds of farmers and modes of agricultural production they encountered in the developing world Here I have traced instead the crucial role played by the growing sense of its own central position in global agricultural belief in its great skill in producing desirable shaping its activities This too is an essential element to consider in understanding the history of its agricultural work in the later twentieth century The Rockefeller gradually expanding ambitions from immediate local concerns to projected global needs is evident in the trajectory of its involvement in seed collection and conservation The role in maintaining genetic stocks began as a enterprise in the with staff in Mexico making collections of the crops they were tasked with improving for Mexican farmers Around this initial maize collection began a slow transformation from being a working collection of Mexican maize varieties intended for use in the creation of better Mexican crops in the near future to being the central repository for a global maize collection whose projected uses included maize breeders from around the world and especially the far future And the Foundation did not stop at overseeing the maize diversity Where the staff of the Mexican program had begun maize collections without an initial vision for their ultimate extent staff of newer crop improvement programs incorporated systematic collecting of regional and global diversity from the outset In the late longstanding concerns about the loss of genetic diversity began to be expressed with much greater urgency by many biologists and breeders Confronting proposals for new international institutions and oversight to address this issue Rockefeller Foundation officers presented the foundation as already well positioned to collections of genetic diversity in all the major economic crop plants and advanced the agricultural institutions they had founded as the ideal permanent international repositories for these collections Here they had challengers namely FAO which advanced itself as the organization best positioned to coordinate the international management of crop genetic resources In the debates that followed Rockefeller Foundation officers effectively positioned themselves and the institutions founded and funded by the foundation as better equipped than FAO the designated UN body for agricultural concerns to understand and take responsibility for the maintenance of resources essential for international agricultural production The Rockefeller engagement with the genetic diversity of crop plants was not only a product of its growing sense of their own centrality in global agricultural production present and future It was also linked to a belief in the success of their own programs Time and again they held up the work of their own employees and institutes as exemplars of collection and management of genetic material even when they knew well that the established collections were vulnerable to disorder and decay The faith in the success of its own programs can also be read into the shared belief of its administrators that they had so fundamentally transformed agricultural production that there was no hope for survival of genetically diverse varieties This was a belief that was apparently shared among the agricultural research institutes as well even as they became increasingly distinct from the foundation As a document produced by a CIMMYT staff member in described as one of the main architects of the so called Revolution has been responsible more than any other organization during the past five years for the displacement of local varieties and primitive cultivars of wheat and maize from their natural regions of cultivation and their replacement with higher yielding exotic varieties Rockefeller Foundation staff were not embarrassed by their implication in this perceived destruction of genetic resources and the risks to future agricultural production thought to be attendant upon it but rather saw it as part of their established record of success It was simply another reason for entrusting the future of the global diversity of crop plants to the foundation and the organizations it had played a central role in creating See Patel for an insightful assessment of the long history of the Green Revolution and competing claims made about its

recovery programmes improve outcomes in surgery but their implementation after upper gastrointestinal resection has been limited The aim of this study was to compare outcomes for patients undergoing oesophagogastric surgery in an enhanced recovery programme Methods EROS was developed after a multidisciplinary meeting by multiple rounds of revision EROS was applied to all patients undergoing major upper GI resection at a university teaching hospital in the UK from with data reviewed at EROS was assessed to identify predictors for compliance Results One hundred six patients underwent major upper GI resection including oesophagectomies gastrectomies and colonic interposition graft Major complications Dindo occurred in patients with death patients were discharged on target day of the EROS programme Age and complications were independently associated with missing this discharge target Conclusion Enhanced recovery is feasible and safe after major upper gastrointestinal surgery Electronic

Gastrectomy http dx doi org Medical Research Council Underwood Timothy J The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract Introduction Enhanced recovery after surgery programmes have proven benefits in mortality and morbidity in a range of settings ERAS programmes reduce patient length of stay and reduce costs The implementation of ERAS after upper gastrointestinal surgery has been limited by a number of factors These include the historically high levels of mortality and morbidity after these types of operations and traditional surgical concerns regarding early feeding and anastomotic leak The evidence for ERAS in oesophageal surgery is in a recent systematic review Findlay et al identified only eight retrospective series with a total of patients These were predominantly reports of single surgeon series and open resections In some units one surgeon but not others have embraced ERAS for oesophageal surgery and in other units only the fittest patients have been included making the overall benefits hard to establish The use of minimally invasive oesophagectomy is gaining momentum in the UK with of resections being either totally minimally invasive or hybrid operations abdomen and open in the latest national audit To date very few reports have included patients treated with MIO within an enhanced recovery programme The most recent systematic review and pooled analysis of enhanced recovery after oesophagectomy identified cases of MIO in ERPs and for MIO on conventional pathways Therefore the aims of this study were to develop introduce and analyse an enhanced recovery pathway for all patients undergoing upper GI resection including open hybrid and totally minimally invasive oesophagectomy Materials and Methods Enhanced Recovery After Oesophagogastric Surgery Programme Development The EROS programme was developed and implemented at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust a single centre teaching hospital in the UK and a designated centre for oesophageal and gastric cancer surgery A draft EROS programme was proposed by the surgical team and subjected to multidisciplinary professional review at a dedicated EROS development day This event was attended by Dr Donald Low Mason Medical Centre who provided detail of the programme at his centre on which the UHS EROS programme was based Multiple rounds of protocol revision were utilised to establish a programme that was considered as best practice and applicable to patients being treated in our centre by all key stakeholders surgeons anaesthetists specialist nurses ward nurses physiotherapists occupational therapists dieticians and patients document The fundamental components of the pathway involved pre peri and elements including patient carer and team expectation and education preoperative carbohydrate loading optimised anaesthesia fluid and pain management early and consistent mobilisation timely removal of tubes and drains early oral intake without the routine use of upper GI swallow studies and aggressive goal setting Full details of the programme including daily goals can be found in Supplemental document The programme was initially designed for all patients who underwent a primary operation including oesophageal anastomosis or total but in practice was used for all patients who underwent major surgery The programme also included a previously published risk prediction tool for anastomotic leak and major complications after oesophageal surgery The target time for discharge was set at day with the goal of discharge to the home or usual place of residence without any increase in support The EROS pathway was applied to all patients undergoing major oesophageal and gastric resections from with data presented up to There were no a priori exclusion criteria Patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or stomach were staged and considered for neoadjuvant therapy based on established protocols and underwent surgery as previously described Outcome Measures Data recorded included demographics tumour characteristics type of resection operative times as to wound estimated blood loss from suction bottles and weighed critical care unit stay overall hospital stay as day of surgery until day of histopathologic analysis of the surgical specimen morbidity and mortality was used to report tumour stage Pathologic tumour clearance was determined according the Royal College of Pathologists system mm Postoperative complications were graded according to the classification and were recorded for the entire inpatient stay grades I and II represent minor complications whereas grades III and IV represent major complications III requires radiologic endoscopic or surgical grade IV indicates complication requiring intensive care An anastomotic leak was confirmed by radiology CT scan or contrast endoscopy or during surgical exploration Elements of EROS were recorded to provide a comprehensive assessment of compliance covering all aspects of the enhanced recovery programme Statistics Statistical analysis was performed with version Chicago Illinois A p value was considered statistically significant Results One hundred six

Major Experience In the calendar year preceding the start of EROS consecutive patients underwent major upper GI resections The overall median length of stay was days to and days for oesophagectomies to Major complications occurred in and there were deaths Discussion This study demonstrated that EROS could be applied to all patients who underwent major upper GI surgery with good outcomes Enhanced recovery was safe and effective after oesophageal surgery and delivered low levels of morbidity and short lengths of stay These findings are in line with results from other surgical disciplines For instance in colorectal surgery ERAS halves morbidity and significantly reduces length of stay Published results for enhanced recovery after oesophageal surgery have shown more modest improvements possibly due to reluctance by the clinical teams to progress patients quickly for fear of significant complications The findings of this study support the application of enhanced recovery for all upper GI patients undergoing major resection with relatively aggressive targets No major differences in outcome between different surgical approaches were observed but the study was not designed to explicitly address this question The development of the EROS programme took into account the infrastructure and resources of the institute where it was introduced meaning that it may not be applicable to different hospitals and healthcare systems This could also be considered as a benefit of the programme as EROS contains the fundamental elements of enhanced recovery tailored to the local environment Other centres wishing to introduce enhanced recovery can be reassured that adapting existing programmes for use in their own hospitals is possible and leads to good outcomes Our experience with EROS suggests that the multidisciplinary team begin to see the programme as the default pathway for all patients undergoing major surgery Anecdotally mobilisation of all patients has improved and the system document introduced for oral intake is now applied to all upper GI patients This has the advantage of removing variation for the junior medical and nursing staff whose shift patterns change regularly The study had a number of strengths The cohort was consistent with contemporary clinical the majority of patients had locally invasive node positive oesophageal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant therapy The surgeons involved had significant experience with minimally invasive oesophagectomy meaning that the applicability of the results for MIO have not been biased by a effect Morbidity data was comprehensively collected by a dedicated data manager and is reported using a validated system Overall outcomes are satisfactory and comparable with data from the UK National Oesophagogastric Cancer Audit and previously published series An improvement in overall length of stay was observed when compared to the year preceding the introduction of the programme versus and our previously published comparison of open and minimally invasive oesophagectomy versus However it is important to note that the benefit for oesophagectomies alone when comparing the EROS time period with the preceding year was only day versus A potentially more clinically relevant improvement was observed for gastrectomies versus but the number of gastrectomies in the EROS cohort was modest n Whilst in this study we have made no attempt to provide a detailed and analysis of EROS major morbidity of compares favourably with our experience in the year preceding the introduction of the programme and with other published series of oesophagectomies performed both on conventional care pathways and within ERPs Reduced morbidity for patients in EROS confirms previous reports from all branches of surgery and may represent the major benefit of enhanced recovery This is particularly important for oesophageal surgery that has witnessed a dramatic reduction in mortality in recent years but has struggled to make into relatively high complications rates A reduction in pulmonary complications has been reported as a significant benefit of both enhanced recovery and MIO In this series respiratory complications were observed in of patients This apparently high level of respiratory complications is in keeping with patients treated on a conventional pathway but includes patients with relatively minor deviations to the clinical course and in the vast majority When only major respiratory complications are considered the incidence falls to Considerable concern exists within the surgical community regarding gastric conduit decompression and the relevance of drainage procedures No pyloroplasties or other drainage procedures were performed in this series and there were no instances of acute conduit distension It appears feasible and safe to remove nasogastric tubes and recommence oral intake early in the course without the routine use of upper GI swallow studies We observed a significant number of readmissions within days of discharge This may reflect an overly ambitious policy of discharge but is also related to an attitude towards discharged patients and the local geography catchment area includes the Isle of Wight and the Channel Our experience suggests that rather than being viewed as a negative outcome readmission should be expected in a relatively small proportion of patients as part of the enhanced recovery programme Further community support for patients and their carers will be required to reduce readmissions and will be a focus for pathway development Reporting of compliance data in ERPs is poor and patients with complications are often removed from ERPs This makes it impossible to determine the efficacy of different aspects of the ERP and their relative effects on outcome In an attempt to address this compliance with the major agreed components of EROS was documented and analysed Age and complications defined by the classification were independently associated with missing the predefined discharge target of days These factors may not be surprising but offer potential ways to improve the pathway For example patients of advanced age should be highlighted in the neoadjuvant or preoperative setting as potentially requiring prehabilitation interventions or increased packages of care to enable them to continue their rehabilitation in the community In addition the focus should shift to preventing minor as well as major complications and this will require a whole multidisciplinary team approach In this study compliance with target mobilisation was poor However this probably reflects overambitious target setting The advantage of such target setting is that of patients walked m on POD and an improvement in mobilisation quantity and distance was observed for each day Consistent mobilisations early in the course proved labour intensive and difficult to achieve and we may have overestimated the availability of local resources to deliver this Future efforts will be focussed on improving compliance in this area and will depend upon the continued development of the multidisciplinary team

strong genetic basis and it has been hypothesised that genetic susceptibility to the environment explains variation in human body weight with differences in appetite being implicated as the mediating susceptibility first described by Professor Jane Wardle This review summarises the evidence for the role of appetite as a mediator of genetic risk of obesity Recent Findings Variation in appetitive traits is observable from infancy drives early weight gain and is highly heritable in infancy and childhood common genetic variants identified through association studies show associations with appetitive traits and appetite mediates part of the observed association between genetic risk and adiposity Summary Obesity results from an interaction between genetic susceptibility to overeating and exposure to an food environment Keywords Obesity Genetic Heritability Appetite Eating behaviour Behavioural susceptibility University College London Springer Media New York Introduction A century ago no more than in of the population were obese the figure had risen to more than in by and currently it is in Survey for Combining overweight and obesity together almost three in four UK adults carry too much body fat Survey for and one in three children Child Measurement Programme The rapid increases in weight are widely believed to have been caused by changes in lifestyle and the food supply creating what is often called an environment Changes in transportation and mechanisation have reduced the amount of energy expenditure required to perform a variety of tasks on a basis At the same time the range of sedentary entertainments has also increased further reducing activity levels Developments in food production processing storage and preparation have resulted in highly palatable and foods becoming more accessible and cheaper The food environment does not force us to overeat but the opportunities and incentive structures have changed making it or end up in positive energy imbalance leading to weight gain However despite the ubiquity of the environment not everyone is overweight Even within the same family there can be striking differences between the weights of siblings living in the same household It is clear that there is substantial variation in susceptibility to the environment and the basis of this variation has been of great interest to obesity researchers One hypothesis put forward is that differential susceptibility to obesity has a genetic basis and excess weight gain arises from a combination of genetic risk and environmental exposure Professor Jane Wardle developed the behavioural susceptibility theory to explain how this interaction between genetic risk and environmental exposure results in weight gain proposing genetically determined differences in appetite as the mediating mechanism BST has important implications for the prevention and management of obesity and public health policy Genes set our potential for becoming obese but the environment determines the outcome George Bray put it well when he said load the gun and the environment pulls the This review summarises evidence for interplay in human body weight and the role of appetite as a mediator of genetic risk The implications of BST for prevention management and policy are discussed Interplay in Human Body Weight For over a century researchers have studied twins to estimate the extent to which variability in human body weight is influenced by genes and the environment Twin designs allow researchers to establish this because identical twins are genetically identical while twins share on average only of their segregating genes but importantly both types of twins share their environments to a very similar extent g they are gestated in the same mother for the same period of time grow up in the same household and are of the same socioeconomic Resemblance between both types of twins can therefore be compared to estimate genetic and environmental influence on body weight any other measured characteristic of Greater similarity between the body weights of MZ versus DZ pairs indicates a genetic contribution to body weight The statistic derived is which quantifies the proportion of variation in a trait g body attributable to genetic variation and ranges from variation plays no role in explaining variability in a to variation entirely explains variability in a But twins also provide important insight into different sources of environmental influence because aspects of environmental variation are partitioned out into those completely shared by two twins in a pair contributing to within pair similarity e g maternal gestational weight and aspects that are unique to each individual twin contributing to differences within pairs e g Nearly a century of research with twins has established that human body weight using body mass index is highly heritable but heritability estimates vary considerably In a review of studies the median heritability estimate was but ranged from to interplay seems to explain much of this variability The review found that heritability estimates were higher in populations living in more environments characterised by those with a higher average BMI and those from countries with a higher average gross domestic product Obesity prevalence tends to be higher in families of lower socioeconomic status in Western countries making lower SES another marker of a more environment A large longitudinal study of Dutch twin pairs from to years of age found significantly higher genetic variance in BMI for children with less educated parents and lower genetic variance in children with better educated parents The modifying effect of SES on genetic variance in BMI has been replicated in adult populations using their own education level Another way to capture exposure to the environment is to estimate the heritability of BMI at a particular age by the assumption being that those born later have spent a greater proportion of their life in a more environment A large Swedish study of around twin pairs and siblings born between and showed that genetic variance in BMI at age was higher for those born later and by implication living in a more environment Together these findings suggest that genetic influence depends to some extent on environmental more the environment the greater the genetic influence on weight The Collaborative Project of Development of Anthropometrical Measures in Twins is a initiative of pooled twin studies that includes twin individuals twin from studies across countries This study showed profound developmental variation in genetic influence which increased from a moderate at years of age to by years of age At the same time an important influence of the shared environment was observed in middle childhood but decreased steadily with age parallel with increasing genetic such that by years of age it had disappeared entirely While it may seem counterintuitive for genetic influence to strengthen shared environmental influence to as children mature the gain in independence means increasing exposure to the wider environment This observation is consistent with a model of gene expression depending on environmental exposure The high heritability estimates observed for human body weight made it a promising phenotype for association studies to identify common genetic variants contributing to variation A variant in the fat mass and gene was the first to be discovered and has the largest effect size of all known variants to date Adults of average height who carry two copies of the variant are approximately kg heavier than adults who carry two copies of the variant FTO was an important discovery not only because about half of the population carries at least one of the variants but also because the effect size was large enough for researchers to explore its mechanisms Currently common variants have been robustly associated with body mass index in These can be aggregated into a composite genetic risk score that is quantitatively associated with BMI explaining approximately of variation among adults and children As is observed with twin studies the environment also modifies the impact of measured genetic risk of obesity In a large European sample of children n low parental socioeconomic position accentuated the effect of FTO on adiposity and in an adult sample the higher risk variant of FTO was only associated with obesity risk in participants with no university education increases in the magnitude of the association between measured genetic risk of obesity using FTO and composite genetic risk and BMI have also been observed in line with patterns of heritability from twin data The strongest evidence yet has come from a recent study showing that the association between measured genetic risk of obesity a composite and BMI was significantly larger for more recent birth cohorts i e those with who had had greater overall exposure to the environment Together these studies provide convincing evidence that genetic risk of obesity depends on exposure to an environment The question is how environments accentuate the effects of genes to maximise genetic expression Jane Wardle proposed that the basis of the interaction is inherited differences in appetite which make some individuals more likely to overeat in response to the many opportunities offered by the current food environment behavioural susceptibility theory Behavioural Susceptibility Theory Appetite Mediates Genetic Risk of Obesity BST hypothesises that genes influence weight at least partly through their effects on e there is variation in appetite that has a strong genetic basis and variation in appetite causes differences in body weight The idea that appetite plays a causal role in obesity is not it was first proposed by Stanley Schachter in In a series of innovative experiments he observed that obese adults ate significantly more than healthy weight adults when the food on offer was highly palatable but showed no difference in intake in response to bland foods At the same time obese adults did not show the same compensatory of food intake following a snack as adults indicating blunted satiety or an overriding of satiety Schachter came up with externality theory to explain these observations He proposed that obese individuals have two distinct aberrations in appetite regulation that lead to they are overly responsive to highly palatable food cues to eat eat in response to the sight smell and taste of palatable and are to internal satiety mechanisms Wardle was the first to make the link between these appetitive characteristics identified by Schachter and genetic risk of obesity She developed the BST in which she hypothesised that genes influence weight at least partly via biological mechanisms that control appetite regulation The BST explains how human body weight can have both genetic and environmental drivers at the same time and why genetic expression on weight is likely to be stronger in more environments Fig Individuals who are genetically predisposed to be highly responsive to food cues are more likely to overeat in an environment in which food cues pervade every aspect of daily living Those predisposed to weaker satiety signals are more likely to overeat in response to larger portion sizes and multiple opportunities to eat Fig How appetite mediates the interaction between genetic susceptibility to obesity and environmental exposure Individuals who inherit a set of genes that bestow greater responsiveness to external food cues and or lower sensitivity to satiety are more likely to overeat in response to an food environment and to gain excessive weight Obesity therefore results from a combination of genetic susceptibility to overeating and exposure to an food environment Development of Psychometric Measures of Appetite for Children In order to test the BST Wardle needed to measure these appetitive characteristics in samples large enough to establish reliable associations with weight demonstrate generalisability and estimate genetic influence measures of appetite provide unparalleled detail but the time and expense incurred prohibit measuring eating behaviour objectively in large samples Another limitation is that only a single of eating behaviour is captured and behaviour is subject to any extraneous factors at play during the time of testing The unfamiliar setting and not liking the test food can be particularly problematic Wardle also saw limitations to studying the BST in adults and considerable advantages to undertaking research with infants and children Adults with longstanding obesity may have abnormalities in appetite as a result of physiological changes caused by the excess weight itself and overweight adults are often dieting Young children are unlikely to be dieting and are too young to have experienced effects of chronic obesity Studying infants prospectively into childhood provides the opportunity to study the relationship between appetite and weight as it starts to emerge Wardle therefore developed the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire a comprehensive psychometric measure of a range of appetitive characteristics to test the BST in large samples of children While standardised psychometric measures lose the objectivity of observations they have the advantage of characterising habitual eating behaviour over many meals and this respect such measures capture the enduring appetitive rather than a of hunger or fullness at the time of testing Young children lack the comprehension skills or to answer questions about their own behaviour but parents tend to know them very well arguably making them the most accurate informants of their behaviour Parent report is of course subjective and has the potential for bias but the CEBQ has been validated against objectively measured eating behaviour The CEBQ is a comprehensive measure of all observable aspects of eating behaviour hypothesised to play a causal role in overweight or to protect against overweight Parents respond to items that describe a range of eating behaviours using a frequency scale to indicate the frequency with which their child demonstrates each behaviour Two scales characterise behavioural measures of responsivity to food cues and are hypothesised to predispose to overweight measures a tendency to want to eat when prompted by palatable foods g if my child is full up s he finds room for his her favourite and of captures the subjective reward experienced while eating g child enjoys higher scores on these scales indicate a more avid appetite Two other scales characterise behavioural measures of responsivity to internal satiety cues and are hypothesised to protect against overweight measures a fullness threshold g child gets full before his her meal is and in captures the pace with which a child finishes a meal with higher eating speed hypothesised to outpace biological satiety mechanisms g child takes more than min to finish a higher scores on these scales indicate better appetitive control Two scales measure the tendency to either or overeat in response to negative emotions is thought to predispose to overweight g child eats more when and is hypothesised to protect against overweight g child eats less when assesses the tendency for a child to be highly selective about what they will agree to eat and captures both refusal to try unfamiliar foods e g child refuses new foods at as well as pickiness about the textures and tastes of familiar foods g child is difficult to please with Fussiness is a common characteristic of children who fail to thrive because they often eat too this trait may therefore offer some protection against overweight The CEBQ scales have good internal and external reliability and show strong tracking from early to late childhood indicating that they characterise fairly stable traits that persist over development The CEBQ has also been adapted to measure appetitive traits during infancy Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire BEBQ and more recently in adulthood Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire AEBQ The BEBQ measures four of the same appetitive traits during the period of exclusive milk feeding before any solid food has been introduced of and in The AEBQ is a version of the CEBQ for adults capturing largely the same appetitive traits as the CEBQ of in and but with the addition of a scale to capture experienced levels of hunger only possible via Together these three measures enable assessment of eating behaviour across the life course from infancy and childhood into adulthood The development of these psychometric measures of appetite has led to the emergence of an extensive literature exploring the relationship between appetite and weight in large samples the genetic basis of appetite and the role of appetite in mediating genetic risk of obesity The majority of research has focused on the scales that characterise the appetitive traits relating to externality theory and of to external food and responsiveness and slowness in blunted responsiveness to internal satiety Variation in Appetitive Traits Drives Weight Gain A wealth of research with the CEBQ has established almost without exception that and of are positively and and in are negatively associated with measures of adiposity in different samples of children ranging from to years of age Importantly studies have also demonstrated that these appetitive traits influence weight across the whole spectrum in a graded fashion They do not simply distinguish the clinically obese from the children but explain more subtle variation in weight as well e g between children at the lower versus higher end of This research provides support for the BST insofar as greater adiposity is characterised by distinctive eating behaviours that predispose to overeating but data cannot provide any insight into the direction of the relationship between appetite and weight Establishing the relationship is not a straightforward task It is not possible to randomise individuals to be more or less food responsive or satiety sensitive and then examine the impact on weight An alternative approach is to use prospective data to establish if variation in appetite predicts weight gain better than variation in weight predicts appetite change The BST also hypothesises that these appetitive traits like body weight itself have a genetic basis Wardle established a large prospective birth cohort of infant twin pairs Gemini to explore genetic and environmental influence on early growth with a focus on behavioural pathways Two design features ensure that the Gemini cohort is well placed to examine the validity of the BST it is a prospective birth cohort allowing the direction of the relationship between appetite and weight to be tracked as it starts to emerge in early life and the twin design allows the genetic and environmental influence on appetite to be explored Gemini was the first study to examine the prospective relationships between appetite and weight from birth Data strongly supported the hypothesis that variation in appetite at months was driving early weight gain from to months not the other way around variation at months did not predict appetite change from to A study strengthened this finding by comparing the growth trajectories from to months of twin pairs discordant for n and n This design enabled an investigation of the relationship between appetite and weight gain while controlling for important environmental confounders that are completely shared by twin pairs g maternal weight gestational weight gain maternal diet during pregnancy The weights of the twin pairs diverged progressively such that by months of age there was a difference equating to a difference in body weight The only subsequent prospective study of infants from Singapore also found that higher and lower in were associated with greater infant weight gain Appetitive Traits Mediate Genetic Influence on Weight Using the BEBQ Gemini has also established the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influence to variation in appetitive characteristics during the earliest period of life when infants are still exclusively Heritability was substantial for each of of and in This finding is striking given that the BEBQ captures variation in appetite for milk very early in life infants vary considerably in their appetite and this variation is both associated with weight gain and is genetically based A study to quantify the extent to which there is genetic overlap between appetite and weight at months found that approximately one third of the genetic influences underlying weight are the same as those underlying appetite supporting the hypothesis that genes influence weight partly through effects on appetite The infant study in Gemini followed only one previous examination of the heritability of of and in a very large sample of twin children n from the Twins Early Development Study also conducted by Wardle The heritability estimates observed in older children were of the same magnitude as those observed in infancy for both of and Eating speed measured objectively in a subsample of the children n also showed high heritability The recent discovery of common genetic variants associated with human body weight has opened up new avenues for detailed examinations of the mechanisms involved and the likely role of appetite Shortly after the discovery of FTO Wardle and her colleagues used data from TEDS to show that children who carried at least one copy of the lower risk variant or were significantly more satiety sensitive than those carrying two copies of the version This effect remained after adjustment for BMI indicating that FTO is influencing body weight via impacting satiety sensitivity This study was replicated using a behavioural measure of satiety sensitivity in a subsample of the children at years of age and shown independently by Cecil and colleagues A more recent study showed that a composite genetic risk score both with and without FTO was associated with in the TEDS children at years of age and mediated part of the association between the genetic risk score and adiposity indicating that FTO and other variants are affecting adiposity partly via mechanisms that regulate satiety In three other large independent samples of adults n n n questionnaire measures of measure of extreme hunger and eating trigged by external food and were also associated with genetic risk of obesity and these appetitive traits mediated part of the association between the genetic risk score and adiposity Gene expression studies have also strongly supported an appetitive pathway insofar as many of the common risk variants are in or near genes that are highly expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland key sites of central appetite regulation The magnitudes of the associations between known genetic variants and appetitive traits body weight are often disappointingly small but identifying the mechanisms is nevertheless an important endeavour Establishing causal pathways can guide researchers towards targeted interventions to reduce obesity risk The evidence for genetic risk of obesity operating least via appetitive mechanisms suggests that behavioural processes may serve as useful intervention targets Behavioural Expressions of Appetitive Traits and Weight Gain A key question of interest has been how these genetically determined appetitive traits lead to weight gain in response to the current environment In other words what are the behavioural expressions of these traits that lead to overeating and weight gain in an everyday context Recent research in Gemini has established that greater responsiveness to food cues and blunted satiety sensitivity are characterised by distinctive patterns of excess intake in very young children When the twins were approximately years old parents completed diet diaries for of the children These data were used to derive two possible patterns of a larger average meal size at each eating occasion and eating more frequently throughout the day Relationships between these intake patterns and appetite and measured using the CEBQ at were explored More food responsive children ate more frequently throughout the day but did not eat a larger amount each time On the other hand children with impaired satiety sensitivity consumed larger average meal sizes each time they ate but did not eat more frequently throughout the day These distinctive patterns of overconsumption make sense given what we know about the interaction between appetite and environmental opportunity Individuals who are highly responsive to food cues are likely to eat more often in response to an environment where food cues are encountered throughout the day Those with weaker satiety signals are susceptible to overeating in response to larger portion sizes because they take longer to feel full require more energy or a larger sized portion of Subsequent research showed that consuming larger average meal sizes but not eating more frequently was the key driver of excessive weight gain from to years of age But it is important to understand the relative contribution of meal size and meal frequency to weight gain in older children who have more autonomy over how much and how often they eat Conclusions The BST has revolutionised our understanding of the genetic and environmental drivers of human body weight It is clear that some individuals face a double onslaught of both biological and environmental pressures Established psychometric measures have revealed that differences in food cue responsiveness and satiety sensitivity begin to emerge after birth and persist across the Variation in these appetitive traits has a strong genetic basis and impacts early weight gain profoundly Research into the BST has shown that individuals who inherit a more avid appetite are more susceptible to taking advantage of the many temptations and opportunities offered by the food environment and to gain excessive weight as a consequence The behavioural expressions of an avid appetite are eating too often throughout the day food cue and eating too much each time satiety BST points very strongly to the likelihood that obesity rates would diminish should the wider food environment change dramatically The reality is that government regulation of the food supply is unlikely to happen in the near future given that public support for making food less accessible palatable or affordable would probably be low In the meantime the development of pharmacological and behavioural treatments that target to food cues and impaired satiety might provide an avenue for success Strategies such as careful portion control and slow eating are already used to circumvent poor satiety responsiveness and there may be other opportunities to attenuate responsiveness to food cues such as attention control or training Given that variation in appetite is observable and measurable from early postnatal life this might provide a useful marker of obesity risk for public health obesity prevention initiatives work on the BST has also provided a firm conceptual framework for the development and testing of early life interventions to attenuate food cue responsiveness and upregulate satiety

range of biological assays involving histochemical and cytochemical analysis Paraformaldehyde has been widely used as a fixation agent It has been empirically recognized in a gold standard protocol that the PFA concentration for cell fixation C PFA is However it is still not quantitatively clear how the conventional protocol of C PFA is optimized Methods Here we investigated the mechanical properties of cell fixation as a function of C PFA by using atomic force microscopy and scanning ion conductance microscopy The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of C PFA on the morphological and mechanical properties of live and fixed mouse fibroblast cells Results We found that both modulus E and the fluctuation amplitude of apical cell membrane a m were almost constant in a lower C PFA Interestingly in an intermediate C PFA between and E dramatically increased whereas a m abruptly decreased indicating that entire cells begin to fix at C PFA ca Moreover these quantities were unchanged in a higher C PFA indicating that the cell fixation is stabilized at C PFA ca which is consistent with the empirical concentration of cell fixation optimized in biological protocols Conclusions Taken together these findings offer a deeper understanding of how varying PFA concentrations influence the mechanical properties of cells and suggest new avenues for establishing refined cell fixation protocols Keywords Scanning ion conductance microscopy Atomic force microscopy Cellular mechanics Cell fixation NTU Joint Research Project Grant Call Korea Nano Technology Research Society Background Understanding how cells behave at material interfaces holds wide importance for key biological applications such as surface interactions mechanobiology and advanced cell analysis Among such applications one of the most practical and widely methods used across the biological sciences is cell fixation which is an essential process for histological analyses in clinical diagnosis Typically when cells are degraded or dehydrated essential cell components such as protein membrane and intracellular structures will also be altered or degraded The surface structure of these cells may also collapse and diffuse away during antibody incubation and washing steps Cell fixation aims to maintain cells or cellular components in state preventing unexpected changes by preserving essential chemical and physical characteristics of cells for further observation Furthermore cell fixation provides an effective approach for immunostaining by allowing the antibodies to access intracellular structures Among various fixation agents for cell membrane and cytoplasmic protein paraformaldehyde is one of the most widely used chemical agents for cell and tissue samples PFA causes covalent between molecules effectively gluing them together into an insoluble meshwork that alters the mechanical properties of the cell surface Previous studies report that the cell surface hardens after fixative treatment Compared to an unfixed cell the mechanical properties of a fixed cell are more uniform across the entire cell surface However there is no systematic assessment of correlation between changes in mechanical properties of live and fixed cells Indeed little is known about how the mechanical properties of cells depend on the PFA concentration Furthermore it has been revealed that subtle adjustment in fixation conditions with e g PFA condition can have dramatic effects on the immobilization of molecules within cellular membranes Understanding the detailed process of cell fixation in various states from living cells to completely fixed cells provides an opportunity to optimize cell fixation protocols and to gain useful knowledge about the living cell fixation process To address this outstanding question we investigated the mechanical properties of cell surface structures as a function of the concentration of PFA C PFA by using atomic force microscopy and scanning ion conductance microscopy These methods allow us to measure the elastic modulus and the surface fluctuation amplitude respectively of cells in both living and fixed states These measurement approaches can be applied to living cells to investigate cell mechanical changes in response to the PFA concentration C PFA We found that both cell stiffness and cell surface fluctuation underwent a transition around C PFA and these quantities were unchanged at a higher C PFA indicating that the cell fixation is stabilized at C PFA ca which is consistent with the empirical concentration of cell fixation optimized in biological protocols Results and discussion Topographical imaging of live and fixed cells with SICM Figure c d show the topography of a single cell imaged by SICM before and after treating with PFA which is the conventional PFA concentration for cell fixation Whereas no clear difference between the untreated and treated cells was observed for the cell height a small difference in cell shape was apparent The live cell shows a maximum height of and the corresponding height in the PFA treated cell appears around However the cells are slightly shrunken so that the cell adhesive area and the cell volume were lower than those of the untreated cell which is in good agreement with anecdotal observations in the biology field The measured cell area and volumes are and in the live cell and and in PFA treated cell Furthermore we found that the roughness of cell surface is larger in treated cells This is probably due to crosslinking of proteins that react with PFA resulting in aggregation and cell shrinkage Fig Schematic view of principle of SPM techiques and cell surface images using SICM a In AFM the attractive or repulsive force between the tip and the sample causes deflection of the cantilever As the cantilever deflects the angle of the reflected laser beam changes angle and strikes a different part of the photodiode The signals from the four quadrants of the detector are compared to calculate the deflection signal Using this signal the system generates a topography of the sample surface b In SICM a filled with electrolyte is brought in proximity to the sample of interest A bias applied between an electrode in the pipette and another electrode in the bulk solution generates an ion current which can be used in feedback control to prevent direct contact between the and the sample c Height image and image of live single fibroblast cell surface using SICM hopping mode d height image and image of fixed fibroblast cell surface The size of all images are after imaging of live cell c fixed with PFA fixed cell imaging d was performed e f Indicates line profile of each image Imaging time of each image is around min Surface fluctuations of cells with PFA treatment We measured the curves of SICM as applied to cell surfaces at various C PFA To estimate cell surface fluctuations the measurement time of the curve was checked against a known standard Figure b shows the representative curves for cells with different C PFA In the solid substrate curve exhibits the steepest slope while in the untreated condition curve exhibits the broadest slope In the cells the curves exists in between Note that the cell treated with PFA was almost the same curve as the solid substrate curves The curves in Fig b were fitted to Eq and the RMS displacement of cell surface fluctuations on treatment of different C PFA are shown in Fig The estimated RMS displacement of surface fluctuations m is approximately nm on the C PFA treated cell However it increases gradually depending on the lower concentration of PFA In the live cell displacements was around nm The chemically fixation caused no difference on cell surface topography e however the surface dynamics was drastically varied It means that the live cell had more active movement compare to the PFA treated cell Smaller surface fluctuations in PFA treated cell can be explained by the PFA treatment effect that results in of proteins between the membrane and cytoplasmic proteins Fig a Schematic view of the cell surface fluctuation setting by SICM To investigate fluctuation levels the was positioned on the apex of the single cell b Typical ion curves of the solid substrate black a fixed cell red a PFA treated cell green a PFA treated cell blue and a live cell sky blue For the solid substrate there was no change In the fixed cell a much broader curve range was observed For the live cell the broadness of the curve range was greatest Fig RMS displacements of cell surface fluctuations The displacements are approximately nm on a fixed cell but much larger on a live cell surface The live cell shows more active movement than fixed cell modulus of cells with PFA treatment To investigate the effect of PFA treatment on cell surface stiffness the curve measurements were performed on live and PFA treated cells Figure b shows typical curve for live cells PFA treated cells and solid substrate Clearly the PFA treated cell exhibits a much steeper force curve slope than a live cell In addition the required force for surface indentation is also larger for treated cells than for live cells Figure shows the averaged modulus E values as a function of C PFA Compared to live cells the stiffness of PFA treated cells C PFA treated cell is gradually increases with higher C PFA Fig a Optical image of AFM tips positioning on the target cell b Typical curve for a fixed cell live cell and solid substrate Compared to live cells the slope of fixed cells approach curve is steeper indicating a significantly larger modulus for fixed cells Fig modulus for varying PFA concentrations in fibroblast cells As expected higher concentrations resulted in a higher modulus approximately kPa on live cells and kPa on fixed cells The cell stiffness measured with AFM is strongly affected by the actin filamentous structures PFA treatment affects the of cell surface proteins including filaments Taken together we concluded that the stiffening of cells directly results in the of proteins Specifically it is assumed that the PFA fixation caused an increase of the cell stiffness depending on the available number of randomly distributed crosslinking sites on the cell surface As shown in Fig modulus does not increase linearly with the C PFA which suggests saturation in the number of available sites for surface protein Below the of C PFA treatment in lower concentration there is no significant effect on cell stiffness but it gradually increases because the crosslinking is occurred randomly In the intermediate C PFA a percolation of the crosslinking occurs so that the stiffness undergoes a transition When treated with higher concentrations of PFA it produces dramatic changes in cell stiffness In this case the stiffness remains unchanged indicating the percolation is completed around C PFA Interestingly the elastic modulus begins to increase before the membrane fluctuation amplitude decreases suggesting that cells can tolerate some degree of protein while maintaining normal function Such findings are in excellent agreement with previous observations that molecules in cellular membranes can remain mobile under certain relatively mild PFA fixation conditions To corroborate these findings cell viability experiments were conducted at different PFA concentrations Figure a shows live and dead cells as distinguished via the staining kit Green color represents live cells and red color represents dead cells As shown in this figure from control to PFA treatment most of the cell culture is live PFA treatment over shows a large increase in red cells indicating widespread cell death Also Fig b shows the quantitative analysis of live and dead ratio from staining data after PFA treatment Between and C PFA appears to be the critical concentration for live cell to dead cell ratio inversion This agreement between cell surface fluctuation modulus and cell viability assay data supports the statement that range encompassing C PFA can trigger sufficient surface protein and in particular that a critical density of events occurs in this PFA concentration range whereby cellular function is irreversibly impaired and likely related to changes in membrane mobility as well In other words this PFA concentration range is critical for to influencing the available number of crosslinking sites on the cell surface and with that cell viability Fig Evaluation of cytotoxicity on cells a Fluorescence microscope images for assessment of live and dead cell ratio dependent on titration of C PFA Green fluorescence represents live cells and red fluorescence represents dead cell scale bar b Percentage graph of live dead cell ratio dependent on the titration of C PFA Data is presented as the mean standard deviation with t test results indicating p Conclusions Herein we have demonstrated a fundamental mechanical comparison between live cells and cells that were fixed with various concentrations of PFA AFM and SICM measurements showed that the apparent surface fluctuation amplitude and elastic modulus of cells underwent transition when exposed to PFA concentrations between and After complete PFA fixation cell surface fluctuation decreased to of live cell while the modulus increased by fivefold compared to that of live cells These results provide a deeper understanding of how cells react to chemical treatment with PFA that takes into account not only the traditional chemical understanding of effect upon the cell but now also the mechanical properties that were targeted in this study It is now apparent that PFA fixation enables the opening of distributed proteins across the cell surface a critical process that facilitates widespread crosslinking Cell membranes that are typically flexible and variable But in a certain situation such as chemical treatment biological functions are changed and morphological changes also occur This is the reason why studying cell surface fluctuations are crucial for the understanding of cell function about cell dynamics Given the general nature of these physicochemical mechanisms we expect that similar effects of PFA treatment on the elastic modulus and membrane fluctuations would also be expected although the specific magnitudes and responses conferred upon PFA treatment might vary on an absolute scale We have confidence in that the SPM techniques could well serve as a promising tool for quantitative studies of both fixed cells and live cells in order to further explore this exciting topic at the convergence of biology and nanotechnology Methods Cell sample We used mouse fibroblast cells cultured in modified eagle medium Invitrogen Life Technique supplemented with fetal bovine serum Fisher Scientific and penicillin streptomycin Life Technique at in a humidified atmosphere containing CO The cell samples with cell densities of mL on a mm diameter cell culture petri dish were washed with phosphate buffered saline three times and then treated with different PFA solutions C PFA and for min Before AFM and SICM experiments the treated cell samples were again washed three times with PBS SPM apparatus A commercial SPM system Park Systems South equipped with an inverted optical microscopy Corp which is designed specifically for biological applications was employed in this study The SPM system not only achieved a soft material sample such as cell surface information using SICM but it also obtained mechanical properties of a sample using AFM All experiments using live cells were performed in a customized live cell chamber Cell Instrument South The live cell chamber was adjusted to with CO and humidity readily providing the specific environmental conditions needed to sustain cell cultures Within this environment live cell SICM imaging or AFM experiment was conducted for extended timeframes via optical monitoring methods including optical phase contrast and digital image correlation microscopy SICM measurement for cell imaging and fluctuation analysis The operation of SICM relies on an ion current that flows between an electrode inside a and an electrode located in an external bath solution This ion current provides a feedback signal used to maintain the distance and allow for the to scan topographical information In spite of low lateral resolution SICM offers useful topographical measurement without applying any mechanical force onto the sample surface SICM imaging and ion curve experiments were performed using customized SPM system with nm inner diameter fabricated from borosilicate capillaries diameter mm outer diameter mm World Precision Instruments using a CO pipette puller Instruments The cell topographic images were obtained with the hopping mode in which the approached sample surfaces with the threshold of The apparent fluctuation amplitude of cell apical surfaces a m was estimated from the curve of SICM measurement The measured ion current with cell apical surface fluctuation was assumed to be a convolution of the relation I and the existing probability of cell surface position at z P z I z z z s I z z P z s z z s d z s The z and z s are the position of the pipette and the sample respectively The z and z s are the position of cell surface and the deviation of the sample fluctuation The relation is approximately expressed as the following form I z z I s a t z z where I sat is the reference current when the pipette is far enough from the sample surface and is a constant from the pipette geometry It is here assumed that the cell fluctuation obeys the Gaussian distribution P z s z z s z s exp z s z z s The curves measured at around the cell center were fitted to the Eq to estimate the apparent fluctuation deviation z s I s a t and were determined experimentally to be I s a t nA and nm respectively which were estimated from the SICM measurement on a glass substrate According to Eq the fluctuation amplitude of apical cell membrane a m is defined as the Gaussian distribution P with the root mean square displacement of cell surface fluctuation z s AFM measurements for modulus of cells The force curve measurements of AFM were performed to estimate modulus of cells We used a commercial AFM cantilever mini Olympus with less than N m of a nominal spring constant Because a cantilever with a small spring constant makes a relatively large deflection for a small force the cantilever used in this study provides reliable data of the cell surface structure The spring constant of the AFM cantilever was calibrated using the thermal vibration method AFM cantilever was cleaned using ethanol and exposed to UV light for min to remove contamination on the AFM cantilever and tip We measured more than force curves with data points The force curves were analyzed with a Hertz model using a commercial SPM data analysis program Systems South We assumed the AFM tip shape is pyramid with a half cone angle so that the force on cantilever F is expressed as F E v tan where E is the moduls is the ratio and is the indentation and alpha were set to

trisomy of chromosome AD is preceded by a prolonged prodromal phase presenting with clinical features that do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for AD It is important to clinically characterise this prodromal stage to help early detection of the disease as neuropathology of AD is almost universal by the fifth decade in DS There is a lack of knowledge of the trajectory of decline associated with the onset of dementia in this population and early signs may be overlooked or misdiagnosed negatively affecting the quality of life of those affected and the use of early pharmacological or psychosocial interventions The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the published literature on longitudinal data in order to identify the cognitive and behavioural changes occurring during the prodromal and early stages of AD in this population Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria including a total number of participants with the duration between baseline and follow up varying from year to years Results suggest that compared to the general population for which memory loss is the most common indicator associated with the onset of AD in people with DS executive dysfunction and Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia are commonly observed during and early stages and may precede memory loss The review highlights the importance of using a broad spectrum of assessments in the context of heterogeneity of symptoms Theoretical and practical implications are discussed as well as the need for further research Keywords Down syndrome disease Dementia Ageing Systematic review Longitudinal University of Cambridge Springer Media New York Background disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized histopathologically by neuronal death neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and clinically by a progressive and irreversible deterioration in cognition and behaviour et al The greatest prevalence of early onset AD is found in individuals with Down Syndrome with symptoms appearing before the age of et al and approximately of people with DS over showing clinical evidence of dementia and Williams As the life expectancy of people with DS has increased from an estimated mean of years in to over years now and Glasson the focus of research and of clinical services now includes adulthood and later life The later stages of AD in people with DS have been documented and are reportedly similar to symptoms exhibited by people with AD in the general population et al However limited information is available with regards to cognitive and behavioural changes prior to diagnosis or during the very early stages and Oliver While in the general population the prodromic stage of AD is characterized by impairments in episodic memory a number of qualitative studies involving people with DS have suggested that the progression of AD in people with DS might be more similar to dementia of the frontal type in the typically developing population with Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and impairment of executive functions e goal directed behaviours such as planning attention judgement etc preceding memory impairments et al Previous research has also indicated that carers often lack basic knowledge regarding the risk for dementia in this population and are not aware of the symptoms that they should be vigilant for in ageing individuals and Glasson The present paper aims to address this gap in the literature and we report findings from a systematic review of the trajectory of changes that accompany the onset of dementia in this population e before the formal diagnostic criteria of AD are If there is evidence for an atypical presentation of dementia such as BPSD and executive dysfunction preceding the development of sufficient symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria of dementia this might partially account for the discrepancy between the almost universal presence of neuropathology from age years onwards and the lower prevalence rates for clinically diagnosed dementia et al given the prevalence rate of neuropathology Identifying symptoms that characterize and early AD in people with DS is necessary before further research and clinical interventions which link findings from neuropathology putative biomarkers or neuroimaging et al with cognitive features can be undertaken Lastly as new pharmaceutical therapies are developed it is necessary to have reliable measures of performance in all relevant outcome domains so that effectiveness of treatments can be evaluated Methods A systematic review was undertaken following the guidelines provided by PRISMA e Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and http www org and the Cochrane Collaboration http www cochrane org Potentially relevant studies were identified through searches in citation indexing databases PubMed and PsycInfo as it has been suggested that they provide broad coverage of biomedical publications worldwide et al Within the electronic database the search was limited to journals published between and and included the following terms OR AND OR OR The search delivered results and reference lists of selected papers were also searched for potentially relevant studies Fig Flow chart showing the process of selecting studies to be included in systematic review Titles and abstracts and then full text articles were reviewed to identify and exclude studies that did not satisfy the previously established criteria empirical papers n specified diagnosis of DS and specific reference to the clinical presentation of early stages of DSAD Longitudinal studies were chosen as this type of study overcomes the issue of cohort effects and allows a better understanding of the dynamic process of cognitive and behavioural change To minimize bias the first author discussed the eligibility and validity of included studies with another member of the research team solving any disagreement by consensus Moreover as authors of the included studies have used a large variety of terms to refer to the same concept e excesses and we will be using the umbrella term Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in order to enhance the overall consistency of the paper Results In total papers reporting on longitudinal studies were selected for data extraction and analysis Data was collected following guidelines set by the Cochrane Collaboration with the following variables being extracted study length participant number and age at each assessment and standard deviation if dementia diagnosis assessment measures and reported progression of symptoms In cases where the longitudinal aspect was part of a larger study data were included only from participants for which at least data points were available Summary statistics ages and were calculated where they were not explicitly stated by authors The duration between baseline and follow up varied from year to years and included a total of participants A brief analysis of bias was conducted on the included studies by examining the degree to which the sampling frame is representative of the general population and whether the assessment tools have been validated as well as the response proportion at both baseline and follow up with minimal risks of bias being identified by the authors Table uses Items et al and

have overlapping authors g Kitler et al et al Devenny et al Urv et al and Ball et al Holland et al and since these are longitudinal studies conducted during the same time period it is likely that some participants overlap within each group which might impact the overall review For each study the following specific aspects were considered first evidence for change between time points in scores on cognitive functioning and secondly the reported BPSD identified as part of the diagnostic assessment Where possible the relationship between these observed changes over time was evaluated Considering

is regarded as the prodromal stage of dementia but it has been argued that in the case of people with DS the exact hierarchy of loss of function is very difficult to establish et al Out of the studies identified here which attempted to address this question nine suggested that were the earliest sign of AD in this population Only two studies reported memory as the earliest sign of dementia Out of the remaining four studies two reported no decline that could not be accounted for by normal ageing and two did not report the order in which domains of cognitive functioning were affected The studies reporting the progression of clinical signs of DSAD are summarized in Table and further discussed in the following sections It is important to note that the majority of studies included in this review the exception of et al have used various screening tools rather than a diagnosis made by a clinician Thus it is possible that discrepancies between results are due to inadequate classification of participants with or without dementia as well as due to the use of different diagnostic methods in each individual study et al Table Studies included in the systematic review Study and sample

percentages at and of the sample had passed away by i Participants who progressed or not from no dementia to a status Memory DS is known be associated with impairments in working memory specifically remembering information for short periods of time It has been suggested that tasks that rely on the hippocampus g associations of items in space and are commonly impaired in this population hence making difficult the measurement of decline in these domains as a marker of change By taking into account the level of baseline functioning researchers interested in memory decline in people with DS have mostly focused on verbal list learning and scene learning and Edgin Compared to the general population where episodic memory impairments characterize prodromal stages of AD in the majority of cases only two of the longitudinal studies included in this review identified impairments in memory as one of the earliest symptoms of DSAD et al Cosgrave et al et al found that decline in memory function scores preceded the onset of global changes associated by the authors with the onset of dementia as reported in informant interviews Decline in memory function preceded more global changes by more than a full year and in some cases by up to years More specifically verbal explicit memory was one of the first domains that were affected with scores on the Selective Reminding Test declining by on two consecutive test sessions The authors compared the results of participants with dementia to those of and individuals with DS and concluded that the dramatic declines observed in DSAD were distinguishable from normal ageing pattern Interestingly even in cases where participants were capable of performing the task those in the early stages of dementia showed deficits in their capacity to encode and retrieve information from memory This view was supported by a previous study in which memory loss was one of the first identifiable hallmarks of AD in an sample of older adults with DS et al In this study participants had difficulty remembering items that they had seen as part of a previous task e delayed and difficulty remembering in which hand a paper clip was held by the examiner after both hands were placed behind the back e immediate However these findings were only applicable in the case of individuals with mild and moderate ID and memory problems were more difficult to identify in participants with more severe intellectual disabilities IQ or profound IQ due to floor effects on established tests More specifically participants with IQ under had very low scores on memory tests regardless of dementia diagnosis and thus these measures may not be suitable as an indicator of decline over time in this population More recently in the IQ test scores have been removed from the diagnostic criteria of ID Psychiatric Association emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive assessment in which severity of ID will be based on the level of adaptive functioning rather than IQ as the former determines the level of support required et al In the study conducted by Devenny et al authors suggested that decline does not occur globally but rather as a systematic and progressive loss of cognitive functions with memory loss being a predominant symptom in all participants who also showed decline on the Block Design and Coding subtests of the These participants were classified as having However the authors emphasize the fact that none of these participants had received an official diagnosis from a physician and thus advise caution when interpreting their results as it is possible that the observed declines were related to some other undetected condition A different view however is that decline in memory scores in the presence of developmental memory are observed in all ageing individuals with DS regardless of dementia status et al Devenny et al Carr and Collins It is possible that by examining alternative measures of decline in other cognitive domains the generalized pattern of deterioration that accompanies old age can be distinguished from preclinical AD In the study conducted by Ball et al informant reported memory changes were not correlated with subsequent diagnosis of AD and all participants who showed changes in memory also showed BPSD However in people with DS early changes in memory may be more difficult to notice compared to BPSD the latter having a greater impact on the daily life and Oliver Certain learning and memory tasks such as and recall tasks may prove to be of a greater sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between AD and in this population et al More recently a review by Sabbagh and Edgin suggested that the earliest symptoms of dementia in individuals with DS are often subtle but are firstly evident in BPSD rather than episodic memory They are thus arguing that the late diagnosis of DSAD is often due to the fact that current classification systems have their emphasis on memory impairments having been modelled after the diagnostic criteria of dementia in the general population and are unfit for use in the DS population Executive Function and Language Functional impairments in executive functioning as referring to informant reported difficulties with various behaviours such as planning and attention and also performance on specific cognitive tests have been identified in the majority of selected studies as preceding memory problems in adults with DS However in the studies reviewed there was not obvious overlap in terms of specific areas of decline identifed by repective authors In Ball et al the most commonly reported changes were impairments in planning attention and lack of foresight while in another study and Oliver the most affected areas were working memory agnosia aphasia and apraxia with cognitive deterioration not being solely attributable to memory issues In the Ball et al paper a version of the CAMCOG neuropsychological test battery modified for use with people with DS was completed at baseline and follow up assessments to provide a measure of decline in global cognitive function To provide more specific information on the sequence of decline in lobe associated over the years prior to diagnosis an additional measure labelled and was designed by combining CAMCOG scores for abstract thinking verbal fluency and the clock drawing item However impairments in planning and foresight were measured through informant reported changes rather than a more objective measure Given the variety of living situations of participants in this study e residential homes sheltered accommodation nursing homes with a parent orrelative we advise caution when interpreting these results The caution is based on research showing that informant reports differ both qualitatively and quantitatively when recorded from personnel in an institution compared to parents Moreover it is possible that of could be affected by intellectual ability and this should also be taken into consideration as out of participants in this study had moderate or severe learning disability In one of the studies executive dysfunction was investigated by looking at verbal intrusions as an indicator of disruption of inhibition control et al Responding with an irrelevant word during a task of verbal memory retrieval was found to be predictive of performance on two out of three memory tasks administered within the next three years Therefore the authors argued that verbal intrusions are an early sign of neuropathology preceding declines in memory Interestingly middle aged participants with DS made more verbal intrusions at baseline compared to participants with unspecified ID vs giving further support to the idea that executive functioning is more sensitive to decline in DS than in other populations Another component of EF was examined by Nelson et al who identified the NBAP Pragnosia scale as useful in classifying of all dementia cases The authors argued that impaired pragmatic language function represents an aspect of cognitive decline as this measure appears to be strongly correlated with the assessment of dementia status Cognitive These impairments appeared to be most common in younger subjects suggesting decline in functions other than memory early in the course of dementia More recently however researchers have argued that verbal scores do not show significant decrease over the course of years and Collins but these results might represent a sample bias as the stronger representation of verbally able women might have influenced the overall stability of verbal scores in the group However the exact sequence in which subdomains of executive functioning are affected has not yet been established This could be largely due to the heterogeneity of DS phenotypes Devenny et al attempted to answer this question by following up participants over a year period and noting that scores which showed decline early in the disease process were those that required perception of abstract stimuli and coordination As participants progressed from prodromal stages to early dementia deficits in comprehension measures of visuospatial organization and the working memory component of language were observed followed by vocabulary information and digit span tasks in the middle stages of AD As decline associated with the development of AD seems to involve progressively more areas of cognition and the number of areas in which decline was observed of was correlated to the severity of dementia the authors conclude that cognitive decline in AD in people with DS is not global but follows a predictable sequence Executive functioning seems according to the evidence presented above to be affected in or early stages of AD and thus detecting these changes could prove to be helpful in predicting a later diagnosis of AD Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia have been defined as a range of psychological reactions psychiatrics symptoms and behaviours resulting from the presence of Recent literature has suggested that BPSD are reported in the prodromal and early stages of DSAD and might predict a more severe diagnosis Often BPSD are reported in the absence of informant observed functional memory decline et al in contrast to the presentation of AD in the general population where impairments in episodic memory are commonly the first reported changes The hypothesis that BPSD and executive dysfunction precede memory issues in the and early stages of AD in DS is relatively recent et al Adams and Oliver Kitler et al Nelson et al Urv et al et al Holland et al This systematic review indicates that there is a limited but significant amount of research supporting the hypothesis indicating that people with DS exhibiting BPSD e those with a history of the onset of these behaviours as opposed to such behaviours being are more likely to decline functionally and on testing have evidence of impaired executive functioning compared to those with no such changes compared to of those without Later the impaired group are then more likely to exhibit memory problems and meet diagnostic criteria for dementia et al Similarly in the study conducted by Holland et al younger people with DS who did not yet meet the full criteria for a clinical diagnosis of AD exhibited more while older people had higher rates of clinically diagnosed AD These results were supported by Nelson et al whose study although not identifying any significant decline in function due to the short duration between baseline and follow up argued for the high reliability and validity of measures of in the detection of AD early in the disease process suggesting that EF and BPSD may indeed precede or accompany memory changes in this population This view is also supported by the results of Holland et al At the time of an initial assessment more participants were reportedly exhibiting changes in behaviour than changes in memory whereas at follow up Older participants had the largest proportion of reported deteriorations in memory and personality whereas younger participants showed high rates of BPSD in absence of any memory issues suggesting a trend of decline from behaviour and personality to a combination of domains This sequential progression of BPSD between various stages of dementia was further examined in studies that reported correlations between the severity of BPSD and a dementia diagnosis et al Urv et al If indeed BPSD are an indicator of dementia development the question that arises is whether certain types of behaviours are more likely to develop In Urv et al participants who showed cognitive decline insufficient for a diagnosis of AD exhibited more BPSD directed towards others e destructiveness than those with a diagnosis of AD who exhibited more BPSD directed towards the self e fearfulness lack of energy withdrawal sadness and Interestingly participants who progressed from no diagnosis to questionable dementia were more likely to experience a worsening of scores on certain measures increased dependency confusion fearful and regressive behaviour and social while the scores of people who were at remained relatively stable on these measures et al Contrary to these findings Adams and Oliver and Makary et al suggested a more positive pattern of ageing than previously reported Similarly to the situation described in the case of executive functioning a specific pattern of deterioration in BPSD subdomains is difficult to identify It was proposed that some of the earliest signs of dementia in people with DS are observed in language and socialization difficulties et al Improving our understanding of BPSD and their relationship to AD is essential given that there are people with DS with very low levels of cognitive functioning who are unable to be diagnosed by measures of cognition alone due to floor levels This group could however be diagnosed on the basis of BPSD and everyday skills et al Similar conclusions were reached by Cosgrave et al who concluded that even though in their study memory seems to be the earliest symptom severe intellectual disability conceals the symptoms and thus BPSD might be easier to detect Informant reported BPSD such as social withdrawal apathy et al Holland et al inactivity and lack of interest and Oliver have been reported in all stages of DSAD et al and it is likely that they significantly affect activities of daily living with declines having been reported in domestic activity and responsibility et al However the authors note that depression is one of the factors that correlate most strongly with such changes et al and may often act as a confound due to diagnostic overshadowing et al alongside hypothyroidism Because of this potential confound caution is advised when discussing the role of BPSD in the progression of DSAD and these reported changes must always be analyzed as part of a wider context Changes such as restlessness aggression repetitive speech and being uncooperative were most often reported in and of AD and thus might represent some of the earliest observable signs of dementia and Oliver Observation of these signs seems to be more likely to lead to a referral for dementia assessment and were shown to emerge alongside cognitive decline In contrast Carr and Collins in her of a birth cohort did not find any increase in aggression with the development of dementia Other BPSD such as emotional lability lack of concern for other people stubbornness disinhibition and impulsivity were also reported prior to a diagnosis of dementia et al Stubbornness was the second most reported BPSD after apathy in a sample of aging people with DS et al and increases in BPSD were identified as successful predictors of dementia status When analyzed alongside scores for pragnosia BPSD successfully predicted over of dementia cases et al Urv et al suggests that these changes are present before a dementia diagnosis and gradually worsen as dementia progresses until late stages of AD when the number of reported distinct behaviours is reduced Activities of Daily Living Activities of daily living represent a number of activities such as continence eating walking or grooming et al and have been shown to be a good predictor of hospital admission and mortality in the elderly population et al Research has suggested that an indicator of the development of AD in people with DS is the loss of everyday skills and difficulties with activities of daily living et al significantly more affected at age compared to age and Collins This pattern of decline seems to be supported by other research et al and it has thus been suggested that investigating ADLs could be very valuable in diagnosing DSAD especially in people with severe ID for whom other changes might be difficult to notice et al However caution is advised when interpreting these results as gender has been suggested to influence rate of decline in ADL in the general population et al with women maintaining skills for a longer time in areas such as food preparation housekeeping and laundry and Brody Regarding the hierarchy of loss of ADLs Cosgrave et al noted that loss of independence in personal hygiene was among the first signs of dementia alongside spatial disorientation The last skills to be lost were eating and shaking hands with of participants being able to perform this latter task even in later stages of AD This is not surprising given the high baseline for the performance of this behavior e at the beginning of the study of participants with moderate ID were able to shake hands with the However at the end of the study many participants were completely dependent on nursing staff having many other difficulties such as incontinence and severe motor difficulties Considering the advanced nature of the disease in these participants it is difficult to pinpoint whether loss of a certain skill is due to loss of social conventions or impaired motor function Regardless more recent studies in the general population do suggest that motor skills should be addressed in interventions designed for people with AD in order to improve their daily living et al Discussion Early Signs of Dementia in DS This review highlights the importance of using a broad spectrum of assessments when examining the sequence of decline of dementia in people with DS particularly in the early stages during which the presentation of dementia may differ between individuals While there is no overall consensus there are a majority of research studies identifying clinical characteristics other than the development of functional memory changes that occur early in the course of AD However an evaluation of the papers included in this systematic review indicates that assessing the hierarchy of decline that accompanies the development of dementia in DS is a challenge First from a methodological perspective change has been identified in two separate ways one being a structured interview asking specifically about functional changes and the other being the use of established cognitive tests that can be repeated over time to established whether there has been a change in test scores or not Secondly as the diagnosis of AD represents a threshold effect it is difficult to pinpoint in time the exact onset of symptoms Thirdly heterogeneity of symptoms seems to be characteristic of the early stages and inferences regarding which subdomains of functioning are preferentially affected are very difficult to make Fourthly in people with DS it is especially difficult to determine whether the observed symptoms are due to changes in this population or to preexisting cognitive impairments et al In the longest longitudinal study included in this review scores on the majority of cognitive tests declined by age regardless of dementia status and Collins emphasizing that researchers must be cautious when interpreting results as for a proportion of participants showing this decline it might suggest symptoms of dementia it might also reflect normal ageing The findings from this systematic review would indicate that BPSD and impairments in executive functioning mark the early course of DSAD Numerous components of executive function and behavior seem to be affected before memory skills begin to decline suggesting that current diagnosis procedures of AD in DS may not be effective until later stages This view is supported by a recent review et al which suggested that dementia in DS initially manifests as BPSD only to later be followed by changes in cognition There are however important differences between study findings that may reflect genuine sample differences or may be accounted for by differences in methodology These differences make an overall picture difficult to ascertain BPSD and executive dysfunction were often investigated as part of studies primarily concerned with cognition whereas memory changes were reported as part of studies that were carried out with the intention of confirming the presence of memory decline Moreover some studies only analyzed a restricted range of abilities and reported on total scores alone without specifying the exact area of decline Given the wide variety of screening and diagnosis tools in use as well as recent research suggesting decline in cognitive function regardless of whether participants have had a formal diagnosis of dementia we support the recent suggestion made by Ballard et al that measures of prevalence reported in published papers should be interpreted with a degree of caution Moreover as with all neuropsychological testing there is overlap in measurement For example a decline in a test of episodic memory would have to be carefully interpreted if there are poor results on attentional tasks Due to this confounding factor we advise caution when discussing the results of these papers as it often is difficult to establish whether a decline on one measure is not influenced by decline in another related domain Lastly interpreting results was hindered by the fact that the majority of studies did not report on the level of intellectual disability of participants This issue is essential considering that the salience manifestation and degree of impairment determined by the emergence of AD symptoms can vary according to the level of premorbid intellectual capacity and also the ability to compensate for the newly acquired deficits et al demonstrated that significant cognitive decline at follow up could only be identified for cases where the baseline score had been at or above the median and moderate with little changes being noticeable for people with severe and profound ID Moreover the majority of studies and Oliver Kitler et al Carr and Collins Cosgrave et al et al Nelson et al et al McCarron et al Makary et al et al did not document whether dementia was at an early or advanced stage As changes in function seem to vary both quantitatively and qualitatively over the course of AD future research should report the stage of decline as well as age and IQ Recommendations Given the findings of this review we believe that establishing a baseline level of cognitive functioning and behaviour in people with DS would be extremely useful in following up on changes in domains known to be affected by AD We therefore advocate the development of a set of common measures appropriate for individuals with DS that would include in depth evaluation of memory executive function language and behaviour and that can be used both in clinical settings as well as research This would allow the implementation of Burt and model of best practice and Aylward which suggests establishing a baseline of premorbid functioning before the age of having annual reassessments and conducting a detailed diagnosis in cases where decline is evident More research needs to be conducted in order to decide on the exact measures to be included in this tool set given the variability in task performance in people with DS et al At present standard tools developed for the assessment of cognition in the general population often show floor effects when administered to individuals with DS and Coetzee and the majority of the assessment tools are based on the premise that respondents have an IQ in or close to the normative range and require other skills such as good verbal skills adequate attention or dexterity et al Burt et al have emphasised the need for an appropriate scoring method for diagnosing dementia in this population and suggested that slope scores are more useful than difference scores For example institutionalised individuals with DS are known to score lower on neuropsychological tests than people living in the community and thus having an established baseline and measuring change over time in a longitudinal follow up design would be a better approach than studies Given that the majority of the studies included in this review point towards BPDS as an early sign of dementia in DS we believe that there is an urgent need for the development of an acceptable validated and standardised evaluation scale for BPSD in DS et al similar to in the general population et al Furthermore diagnostic and assessment measures developed for use in the general population are often used in studies investigating AD in DS which often introduces confounding factors et al This issue was pointed out by Dekker et al who stated that although more than scales have been developed to assess BPSD in AD in the general population none of these have been validated in people with DS and therefore are not equally valuable for use in this population as they do not take into consideration factors such as behavioural issues associated with ID In line with the findings of Dekker et al such a scale could be implemented in routine practice alongside existing assessment procedures which monitor change over time as well as being used in longitudinal research and clinical trials Having comprehensive assessment tools for outcomes in clinical trials would enable a targeted approach to drug development which would be essential given recent findings suggesting that people with DS respond differently to treatment when compared to AD typically developing controls et al Moreover a better understanding of BPSD in DS would increase acceptance from the perspective of a carer who would understand that behaviour they perceive as is not deliberate but may be a symptom of dementia et al Imporved recognition of symptoms would facilitate access to treatments such as behavioural and music therapy and psychosocial interventions et al To account for the fact that BPSD and executive dysfunction seem to be affected earlier than episodic memory in the course of dementia we suggest reserve capacity hypothesis as a viable theoretical explanation According to this model the frontal lobes of people with DS are underdeveloped and thus a smaller buden of neuropathology in the brain may be required to reach the threshold at which functioning is impaired Volume reduction of frontal lobes has been observed during childhood while hippocampal volume reduction has only been reported later in life These observations would account for the preferential decline in areas of cognition by these areas Indirect support for reserve capacity hypothesis comes from the longitudinal study conducted by Temple et al in which progression of dementia appears to be slowed by having high levels of cognitive functioning The authors suggest that environmental interventions such as improving the level of education and number of years in employment might represent successful strategies to reduce cognitive decline The suggestion that early clinical presentation of AD in DS matches that of symptoms can serve as a theoretical foundation for the findings of neuroimaging studies such as the recent amyloid PET imaging with study that showed increased frontal predominance of amyloid pathology in people with DS who had a diagnosis of AD compared to typically developing patients with AD et al To conclude even though there is no overall consensus on what represents the earliest observable sign of dementia in DS this review highlights the heterogeneity of affected domains BPSD developing for the first time in later adult life predicts the subsequent development of dementia in the majority of the included studies There is also evidence that emergence of BPSD is underpinned by impairments in executive functioning that may implicate impairments in frontal lobe integrity and in related brain networks et al We recommend that future research should investigate a wider variety of processes to reflect the heterogeneity of domains that seem to be affected in the prodromal and early stages of dementia in this population Moreover considering that in the general population amnestic MCI is widely accepted as the prodromal stage of AD an alternative should be proposed for people with DS to reflect this difference in progression The key to early diagnosis is knowing what observed changes should raise the index of suspicion sufficiently to indicate the need for a full diagnostic assessment and cognitive evaluation The findings of this review are especially relevant given that current diagnosis procedures and emphasize declines in memory functions and therefore in this population may fail to facilitate the early detection and diagnosis of dementia when it does occur Acknowledgments This systematic review is part of a larger research study funded by the Baily Thomas Charitable Fund
