Decision

Also

The
upshot
previous

mutual

three

really
conflated

At
best

might
initially
seem
likely
mutually
independent
neither

mineness
certainly
entails
neither

This
reason
enough
avoid
using
three
concepts

But
could
also
apply
distinct
properties
One
way

find

Some

cases
might
tentatively
taken
suggest

fail
occur
simultaneously
pathological
conditions
In
particular
mineness
may
sometimes
fail

even
though

If
mineness
indeed
selectively
disappear

prove

concepts

neither

I
also
gave
reason
doubt
whether
complementary
relations

hold
The
previous
point
case
suffices
preclude
conceptual
equivalence

notions
In
addition
I
argued
notions

fail

That

Whether

That
