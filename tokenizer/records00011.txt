changes were made Distance measures play a central role in evolving the clustering technique Due to the rich mathematical background and natural implementation of l p distance measures researchers were motivated to use them in almost every clustering process Beside l p distance measures there exist several distance measures Sargent introduced a special type of distance measures m and n which is closely related to l p In this paper we generalized the Sargent sequence spaces through introduction of M and N sequence spaces Moreover it is shown that both spaces are BK and one is a dual of another Further we have clustered the dataset by using an induced M measure by the Sargent sequence space M in the clustering algorithm The clustering result established the efficacy of replacing the Euclidean distance measure by the M measure in the algorithm MSC Keywords clustering double sequence clustering dataset The Introduction Clustering is a procedure to deal with an unsupervised learning problem appearing in pattern recognition Clustering is a process of organizing data into groups called clusters so that objects in the same cluster are similar to one another but are dissimilar to objects in other clusters The main contribution in the field of clustering analysis was the pioneering work of MacQueen and Bezdek They had introduced highly significant clustering algorithms such as and fuzzy Among all clustering algorithms is the simplest unsupervised clustering algorithm that makes use of a minimum distance from the center and it has many applications in scientific and industrial research more information about the clustering algorithm see Section algorithm is distance dependent so its outputs vary with changing distance measures Among all distance measures a clustering process was usually carried out through the Euclidean distance measure but many times it failed to offer good results In this paper we define M and N measure Further M is used to cluster dataset The output result is compared with the result of Euclidean distance measure to show the efficacy of M over the Euclidean distance measure M and N measures are the generalization of m and n measures introduced by Sargent and further studied by Mursaleen know more about m and n refer to The M and N spaces are closely related to l p distance measures l p measures and its variance are mostly used to solve the problems evolving in the fields of Market prediction Machine Learning Pattern Recognition Clustering etc Throughout the paper by we denote the set of all real or complex sequences Moreover by l c and c we denote the Banach spaces of bounded convergent and null sequences and let l p be the Banach space of absolutely p sequences with p p For the following notions we refer to A double sequence x x j k of real or complex numbers is said to be bounded if x x the space of all bounded double sequences is denoted by L A double sequence x x j k is said to converge to the limit L in sense convergent to L if for every there exists an integer N such that x j k L whenever k j k N In this case L is called the p of x If in addition x L then x is said to be boundedly convergent to L in sense bp to L A double sequence x x j k is said to converge regularly to L r to L if x is p and the limits x j lim k x j k j N and x k lim j x j k k N exist Note that in this case the limits lim j lim k x j k and lim k lim j x j k exist and are equal to the p of x In general for any notion of convergence the space of all double sequences will be denoted by C and the limit of a double sequence x by lim j k x j k where p p bp r Let denote a vector space of all double sequences with the vector space operations defined Vector subspaces of are called double sequence spaces Let us consider a double sequence x x m n and define the sequence s s m n via x by n s m n i j m n x i j m n N Then the pair x s and the sequence s s m n are called a double series and a sequence of partial sums of the double series respectively Let be the space of double sequences converging with respect to some linear convergence rule lim R The sum of a double series j i j x i j with respect to this rule is defined by j i j x i j lim s m n and introduced the space L p in p L p x m n m n x m n p p corresponding to the space l p for p and examined some of its properties Altay and have generalized the spaces of double sequences L C p and C bp to n p n L t x m n sup m n N x m n t m n C p t x m n p lim m n x m n t m n and C bp t C p t L t respectively where t t m n is the sequence of strictly positive reals t m n In the case t m n for all n m n N L t C p t and C bp t reduce to the sets L C p and C bp respectively Further let C be the space whose elements are finite sets of distinct positive integers Given any element of C we denote by c the sequence c n which is such that c n if n c n otherwise Further let C s C s C n c n s be the set of those whose support has cardinality at most s and and n n and n n n where n n n and For the following sequence spaces were introduced and studied in by Sargent and further studied by Mursaleen in x m x x n sup s sup C s s n x n and x n n x x n sup u S x m n u n n Remark The spaces m and n are BK with their usual norms If n n then m l n l and if n n n then m l n l l m l l n l for all For any m l p n l q p p In this paper we define spaces for double sequences x x m n For this we first suppose U to be the set whose elements are finite sets of distinct elements of N N obtained by where C s and C t for each t s t Therefore any element of U means m n m and n having cardinality at most st where s is the cardinality with respect to m and t is the cardinality with respect to n Given any element of U we denote by c the sequence c m n such that c m n if m n otherwise Further we write U n st U s t U m n c m n s t for the set of those whose support has cardinality at most st and and n m n m n and m n m n m n where n n m n m n m n m n m n and m n m n m n I Throughout the paper we write n m n for m n and S x is used to denote the set of all double sequences that are rearrangements of x x m n For we define the following sequence spaces x x t n M x x m n x M sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n and x x n N x x m n x N sup u S x m n u m n m n Then the distances between x x m n and y y m n induced by M and N can be expressed as t n d M sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n y m n and v n d N sup u v S x m n u m n v m n m n Remark If s t t s t then M L N L and if s t s t t s t then M L N L We now state the following known results of for single sequences which can also be proved easily for double sequences Lemma If the series u n x n is convergent for every x of a BK space E then the functional n u n x n is linear and continuous in E Lemma If E and F are BK spaces and if E F then there is a real number K such that for all x of E x x x F K x E Properties of the spaces M and N Theorem The space M is a BK space with the norm x t n x M sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n Proof It is a routine verification to show that M is a normed space with the given norm and so we omit it Now we proceed to showing that M is complete Let x l be a Cauchy sequence in M where n x l x m n l m n for every fixed l N Then for a given there exists a positive integer n such that t n x l x r M sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n l x m n r for all r l r n which yields for each fixed t s t and U s t n all r m n x m n l x m n r for all l r n Therefore n n all r m n x m n l m n x m n r for all l r n This means that n m n x m n l l N is a Cauchy sequence in R for every fixed t s t and U s t Since R is complete it converges say n n m n x m n l m n x m n as l Since absolute convergence implies convergence in R hence n n l m n x m n l m n x m n as l Hence we have n n lim l m n x m n l m n x m n M Let n y l m n x m n l Then y l l Therefore n k sup l N m n x m n l k Since n n n m n x m n m n x m n x m n l m n x m n l k it follows that x x m n M Since x l l N was an arbitrary Cauchy sequence the space M is complete Now we prove that M has continuous coordinate projections p m n where p m n K and p m n x x m n The coordinate projections p m n are continuous since t x x m n sup s t sup U s t s t x M for each n m n N Remark The space N is a BK with the norm x n x N sup u S x m n u m n m n Lemma If x M x N and u S x then u M u N and u x If x M x N and u m n x m n for every positive integer m n then u M u N and u x Proof Let x M then t n sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n So we have n each and t s t m n x m n for each U s t and s t Since the sum of a finite number of terms remains the same for all the rearrangements n n each and s t s t m n u m n s t m n x m n for each u S x and U s t s t Hence t n t n sup s t sup U s t s t m n u m n sup s t sup U s t s t m n x m n thus u M and u x By using the definition easy to prove Theorem For arbitrary we have M and M Proof Let s and t be arbitrary positive integers let U s t and let constitute the element of and exceed by s and t respectively also from the definition we have and m n m n Then m m m m n t t t t n m m n n m s t m n n m m n s t n m m n m n s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t s t max s t s t s t s t s t s t Lemma If x M and c c c n c c c n c m c m c m n is a rearrangement of b b b n b b b n b m b m b m n such that c c c n c c c n c m c m c m n and c c c m c c c m c n c n c n m then j j i j m n b i j x i j x M i j m n c i j i j Proof In view of Lemma it is sufficient to consider the case when b i j c i j i m j n Then writing j X m n i j m n x i j we get j j j j j j i j m n b i j x i j i m j n c i j c i j c i j c i j X i j c m n X m n x M i m j n c i j c i j c i j c i j i j x M c m n X m n x M i j m n c i j i j Hence we have j j i j m n b i j x i j x M i j m n c i j i j Theorem In order that u i j x i j be convergent absolutely convergent whenever x M it is necessary and sufficient that u N Further if x M and u N then j i j u i j x i j u N x M Proof Necessity We now suppose that u i j x i j is convergent whenever x M then from Lemma we have j K i j u i j x i j K x M for some real number K and all x of M In view of Lemma we may replace x i j by x i j sgn u i j obtaining j K i j u i j x i j K x M Let v S u Then taking x to be a suitable rearrangement of it follows from Eq and Theorem and Lemma that j i j v i j i j K and thus u N Sufficiency If x M and u N it follows from Lemma that for every positive integer m and n j i j u i j x i j u N x M Theorem In order that u m n x m n be convergent absolutely convergent whenever x N it is necessary and sufficient that u M Proof Since sufficiency is included in Theorem we only consider necessity We therefore suppose that u m n x m n is convergent whenever x N By arguments similar to those used in Theorem we may therefore have that n K m n u m n x m n K x N for some real number K and all x of N Let x c where U s t Then x N and n x N sup U s t m n m n s t from Theorem and Eq we have n s t m n u m n K s t U s t s t and thus u M Inclusion relations for M and N Lemma In order that M M N N it is necessary and sufficient that t sup s t s t s t Proof Since each of the spaces M and N is the dual of the other by Theorems and the second version is equivalent to the first Moreover sufficiency follows from the definition of an M space We therefore suppose that M M Since M it follows that M and hence we find that for every positive integer t s t j s t i j s t i j s t M where Theorem L M L L N L for all of M L N L if and only if bp lim s t s t M L N L if and only if bp lim s t s t s t Proof We prove here the first version while the second version follows by Theorems and Since m n m n m n for all of we have by Lemma that is satisfied Further from Lemma it follows that M L if and only if t sup s t s t while L M if and only if t sup s t s t s t since the sequences s t and st s t s t are monotonic and are also satisfied Theorem Suppose that p p and p q Then Given any of M L p N L q In order that L p M N L q it is necessary and sufficient that t sup s t s t q s t In order that M L p N L q it is necessary and sufficient that L p L p M L p L p N L q Proof Let us suppose that M L p Then by Lemma there exist real numbers r and r r r such that for all x of M r x L p x M r x L p Taking x c where U s t we have that t r s t p s t s t r s t p s t and hence that t r s t q s t r s t In view of Lemma this implies that M M where m n q Since M by Theorem but L q this leads to a contradiction Hence follows If L q M arguments similar to those used in the proof of show that t s t q K s t s t For sufficiency we suppose that is satisfied Then whenever x L p and U s t n n n m n x m n m n x m n p p m n q x L q s t q K s t x L q and hence x M In view of it follows that L q M By Theorem we have M For sufficiency we suppose that L p and that x M Then u m n m n L whenever u L q and it therefore follows from Lemma that u m n x m n L whenever u L q Since L p is the dual of L q and since M L p it follows that M L q By using we have L p M L p Now for obtaining the complementary relation L p L p M let us suppose that x L p Then n lim m n x m n and hence there is an element u of S x such that u m n is a sequence If we take j i j m n u i j then it is easy to verify that and that x M Since L p the complementary relation is satisfied Application of M and N in clustering In this section we implement a clustering algorithm by using M measure Further we apply the algorithm into clustering to cluster data The clustering result obtained by the M measure is compared with the results derived by the existing Euclidean distance measures l Algorithm to compute M distance Let x x x x x n n and y y y y y n n be two matrices of size n and let m n n n Calculate a i i x i y i i n The M between x and y is d where d max a a a a a a n clustering algorithm for M measure Let X x x x x n be the data set Randomly judiciously select k cluster centers this paper we choose first k data points as the cluster center y x x x k By using M or N distance measure both are dual of each other in application point of view we only consider M compute the distance between each data points and cluster centers Put data points into the cluster whose M with its center is minimum Define cluster centers for the new clusters evolved due to steps the new cluster centers are computed as follows c i k i j k i x i where k i denotes the number of points in the i th cluster Repeat the above process until the difference between two consecutive cluster centers reaches less than a small number dataset clustering by using M measure in algorithm dataset is a nonconvex data set It is an artificially designed two dimensional dataset consisting of data points dataset is visualized as clusters Figure Figure Original shape of dataset By using M measure in the clustering algorithm the obtained result is represented in Figure In Figure we represent the result obtained by using the Euclidean distance measure in the algorithm measure the accuracy of the cluster by using the formula accuracy of data points in the right cluster total number of data The experimental result shows that cluster accuracy of M measure is while l clustering accuracy is Thus M measure substantially improves the clustering accuracy Figure Clustering induced by M measure Figure Clustering induced by Euclidean distance l Conclusions In this paper we defined Banach spaces M and N with discussion of their mathematical properties Further we proved some of their inclusion relation Furthermore we applied the distance measure induced by the Banach space M into clustering to cluster the data by using the clustering the result of the experiment shows that the M measure extensively improves the clustering accuracy

were made Gill parasites on fish are likely to negatively influence their host by inhibiting respiration oxygen transport capacity and overall fitness The glochidia larvae of the endangered freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera are obligate parasites on the gills of juvenile salmonid fish We investigated the effects of FPM glochidia encystment on the metabolism and haematology of brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus Specifically we measured oxygen uptake rates at rest and following an exhaustive exercise protocol using intermittent respirometry as well as haematocrit in infested and uninfested trout Glochidia encystment significantly affected metabolic rate as infested trout exhibited higher standard and maximum metabolic rates Furthermore trout also had elevated levels of haematocrit The combination of an increased metabolism and haematocrit in infested fish indicates that glochidia encystment has a physiological effect on the trout perhaps as a compensatory response to the potential respiratory stress caused by the glochidia When relating glochidia load to metabolism and haematocrit fish with low numbers of encysted glochidia were the ones with particularly elevated metabolism and haematocrit Standard metabolic rate decreased with substantial glochidia loads towards levels similar to those of uninfested fish This suggests that initial effects visible at low levels of encystment may be countered by additional physiological effects at high loads e g potential changes in energy utilization and also that high numbers of glochidia may restrict oxygen uptake by the gills Keywords Glochidia Haematocrit Host Margaritifera Metabolic rate Parasite http dx doi org Stiftelserna Wilhelm och Martina Lundgrens Herbert and Karin Jacobssons foundation Swedish Anglers Association http dx doi org Helge Ax son Johnsons Stiftelse Berlin Heidelberg Introduction Parasites can negatively affect their hosts through direct manipulation inducing immunological responses and increasing energetic demands which in many cases influence the behaviour and fitness of the host Moore A variety of aquatic parasites such as the larvae of many species of unionoid mussels attaches and encysts on the gills of fish et al Denic et al Meyers et al Young and Williams Such encystment can affect both the physiology and behaviour of the host In response to glochidia encystment fish hosts have been shown to hyperventilate et al undergo haematological alterations et al and exhibit immunological reactions The effects of these alterations include impaired gas exchange increased and Sproul reduced foraging et al and competitive ability et al reduced swimming performance and in cases of high infestation rates glochidia per gram fish weight or even mortality and Geist For example glochidia encystment on largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides resulted in higher ventilation rates reduced oxygen consumption and decreased tolerance of conditions for the host fish suggesting that gill parasites can pose a respiratory burden for their hosts In another example sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus increase their foraging time when infected by parasites even though this poses a greater risk for predation which suggests that the higher energy demand imposed by the parasites leads to increased in order to obtain enough food to sustain fitness and Sproul The freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera is an extremely unionoid bivalve with a Holarctic distribution Graf and Cummings et al It is endangered throughout its range yet geographically widely distributed in European streams et al In Europe glochidia of the FPM are obligate parasites on the gills of juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar Linnaeus and Williams Where the two species occur in sympatry both may function as hosts for FPM et al In some streams however only one of the species is the host for certain FPM populations even though both brown trout and Atlantic salmon are present et al Ieshko et al Karlsson et al Large conservation efforts have been made to protect FPM and much research is conducted to understand the causes for its decline and its interactions with the salmonid host species Karlsson et al et al and The glochidia are released by gravid females during summer and reach their host passively via the water current After inhalation by a host fish glochidia attach and encyst on epithelial cells located on the gill lamellae where they absorb nutrients from the gill tissue et al Nezlin et al Glochidia are encysted for approximately months during which they grow approximately times in size whilst metamorphosing to juvenile mussels and Vogel Denic et al Infestation of FPM glochidia in juvenile salmonids has traditionally been assumed to be more or less benign to host fish However recent studies reveal that FPM glochidia encystment can increase the recovery time required following a stressful event et al induce an immune response et al decrease foraging success et al negatively impact competitive ability et al and reduce the capacity for swimming and Geist Previous studies suggest that parasite infestation can have significant implications for the host For example trematode infestation was reported to lower the standard metabolic rate of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus Linnaeus which was suggested to be due to potential perturbations in energy utilization et al Similarly brown trout infested with high numbers of glochidia took longer to return to their basal rate of ventilation following a stressful event than uninfested fish which suggests that the glochidia constitute a respiratory burden et al Unfortunately oxygen uptake was not quantified in Thomas et al and therefore it is currently unknown whether or not FPM glochidia affect the metabolism e standard and maximum metabolic of host fish Haematocrit erythrocytes in total blood can be used as an indicator for oxygen transport capacity in an organism as high levels of erythrocytes allow an increased amount of oxygen to be transported in the blood Typically vertebrates that are adapted or acclimatized to increased aerobic demands or environments usually exhibit elevated Hct values et al However low Hct values are not necessarily consistent with low oxygen transport capacity as it can be compensated via increases in cardiac output et al Several fish species including salmonids have reduced Hct values when infested with and parasites and Jakobsen Jones and Grutter Nair and Nair Paperna et al explained as an effect of parasites either causing osmotic failure a result of exposed or by blood ingestion and Jakobsen Jones and Grutter Nair and Nair Reduced Hct can affect oxygen transport capacity through anaemia which may negatively affect foraging success swimming capacity activity and overall survival and Grutter Pearson and Stevens However if parasites affect oxygen uptake or metabolism Hct could also increase as a compensatory effect to enhance oxygen transport capacity by splenic release of stored blood cells plasma loss or increased size of erythrocytes and Stevens Only a few attempts have been made to investigate whether FPM glochidia affect haematological parameters in salmonids Hct was observed to increase in chinook Oncorhynchus tshawytscha Walbaum and coho Oncorhynchus kisutch Walbaum salmon et al However this trend is not universal as Thomas et al found no effect of parasitic glochidia on the Hct of infested brown trout Even a month after infestation the spleen of infested trout were enlarged et al which indicates that glochidia may indeed affect the haematology in this host fish species as this organ is involved in immunological activity haematopoiesis and haemolysis and can also function as an erythrocyte reservoir and Nilsson Pearson and Stevens The overall aim of this paper is to investigate the potential effects of natural levels of FPM glochidia encystment on the metabolism and haematology of wild juvenile brown trout Specifically we measured oxygen uptake rates at rest and following an exhaustive exercise protocol a proxy for standard and maximal metabolic as well as Hct in infested and uninfested individuals captured from the wild We hypothesised that trout would exhibit increased standard metabolic rate maximum metabolic rate and Hct when compared to uninfested fish in order to compensate for respiratory stress caused by encysted glochidia Methods Experimental animals and holding conditions Juvenile brown trout of mixed sexes were collected in April from the stream in the catchment Sweden N using standardized electrofishing et al The trout were lightly anaesthetized in the field mL L Pharmac Ltd and visually assessed in order to determine whether they were infested with parasitic glochidia A total of brown trout were caught infested and Fork lengths mean were mm for infested trout and mm for uninfested trout Wet weights were g for infested trout and g for uninfested trout Trout were subsequently transported in a tank to the University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden Fish were housed in a L aquarium m m The aquarium was supplied with freshwater from a filtration system Photoperiod followed natural cycles and the water temperature was kept constant at Respirometry and exhaustive exercise protocol Fish were fasted for days to allow gut evacuation prior to use in respirometry experiments Individual fish were then selected randomly and lightly anaesthetized in water containing mL L Chemistry Upon loss of equilibrium individuals were weighed and placed into cylindrical intermittent respirometers of or L depending on fish which were submerged in a reservoir bath containing aerated freshwater The fish were left undisturbed in the respirometers for h while oxygen consumption was measured using best practices in intermittent respirometry Clark et al Briefly water was continuously circulated through each respirometer using an submersible pump within a recirculation loop and the partial pressure of oxygen in the water in the respirometers was measured continuously at Hz using a FireSting O system Aachen calibrated in accordance with the manual Automated flush pumps refreshed the water in the respirometers for min in every period ensuring that oxygen levels in the respirometers always remained above air saturation oxygen uptake was calculated from the decline in partial pressure of oxygen in the water of the respirometers during each period between flush cycles SMR was calculated for each fish as the mean of the lowest of oxygen uptake measurements during the period where the fish were left undisturbed after respirometer entry outliers which were considered to be SD below the mean of the lowest of Following the undisturbed period fish were individually removed from their respirometers and subjected to an exhaustive exercise protocol et al consisting of a period of manual chasing around a circular tank m water depth containing aerated freshwater at All individuals were visibly exhausted by the end of the exercise period as highlighted by a lack of response to an experimenter tapping the caudal fin Immediately following the exercise protocol fish were returned to their individual respirometers whereupon respirometers were sealed for min and the MMR was taken as the steepest slope during this time Glochidia load determination Glochidia load was estimated for each fish directly after they had been in the respirometers Trout were anaesthetized mL L and glochidia load was examined by gently lifting the operculum and gill arches using pincers The number of encysted glochidia was counted as precisely as possible for each fish However the number of glochidia on heavily infested fish could not be estimated to an exact number using this method Thus trout with more than glochidia encysted on their gills were set to have glochidia when analysing the data Hct measurements Following glochidia determination blood samples were obtained for the determination of Hct By using heparinized G hypodermic needles Braun Medical attached to syringes it was possible to withdraw mL of blood from an individual via puncture of the venous vasculature directly caudal of the anal fin However due to the small size of some individuals it was not possible to withdraw adequate blood samples from all fish thus a smaller sample size for the determination of Hct was obtained infested and uninfested Hct was determined as the fractional red cell volume upon centrifugation of a subsample of blood in microcapillary tubes at rpm for min Statistical analyses Fork length body mass and condition factor of infested and uninfested fish were compared using independent sample t tests Homoscedasticity and normal distribution of residuals were assessed and found to be appropriate assumptions by inspection of spread and symmetry of boxplots and plots Relationships between size and number of glochidia on the gills were investigated using Spearman rank correlations Differences between and uninfested individuals were analysed using linear models including presence absence of glochidia as a fixed factor and ln as a covariate Size effects were corrected for in the statistical model using wet mass as a covariate Given that metabolic rate is a power function of body mass we assumed a linear relationship between metabolic rate and wet mass This was also found to be an appropriate assumption based on inspection of scatterplots Assumptions regarding residual normality and homoscedasticity of residuals were judged to be adequately fulfilled by visual inspection of residuals and Differences between infested and uninfested fish were assessed based on the estimated marginal means at the mean value of the covariate For infested fish we descriptively investigated whether glochidia load affected SMR MMR or Hct using local regression with glochidia load used as independent variable and Spearman rank correlations The SMR MMR and Hct values for each individual were as residuals from the LMs used to investigate general

estimates B for all three linear models are presented in Fig Effects of glochidia load on SMR MMR and Hct We found that SMR tended to decrease with increasing glochidia load which made individuals

the scatterplots showing data in relation to glochidia load the lines show the local regression with confidence limits in grey All data was standardized for size by using residuals from the respective linear model presented in Fig Discussion trout exhibited significantly higher SMR and MMR and elevated levels of Hct which demonstrates the potential of encysted glochidia to affect metabolic rate and oxygen transport capacity Furthermore trout also had elevated levels of Hct The combination of increased metabolism and increased Hct values in infested fish indicates that there is a physiological effect on the trout caused by the glochidia perhaps as a compensatory response to the potential respiratory stress caused by glochidia encystment Similarly our finding that trout had higher Hct is similar to that of a previous study whereby Hct of chinook salmon increased following infestation by western pearl shell Margaritifera falcata Gould glochidia et al The increased Hct of infested chinook salmon was related to a combination of increased number of circulating erythrocytes and cell swelling e increased mean corpuscular volume and reduced mean corpuscular haemoglobin et al This may also be the case for the infested brown trout in the present study however future measures of cell number and size are necessary to substantiate these claims When relating glochidia load to metabolism and Hct the fish with lower numbers of glochidia per gram body mass were the ones with particularly elevated metabolism and Hct Interestingly SMR then decreased with substantial glochidia loads towards levels similar to those of uninfested fish This is not necessarily suggesting that trout with high glochidia loads are unaffected Rather we hypothesise that the initial effects visible at low levels of encystment may be countered by additional physiological effects at high loads g potential perturbations in energy utilization as suggested by et al Previous studies have shown that low glochidia loads glochidia per gram body are not lethal and do not necessarily affect the host salmonid performance at least when kept under aquaculture conditions and Geist Treasurer et al However very high glochidia loads have been shown to cause mortality in brown trout to mortality within h with loads of glochidia per gram body and Geist Furthermore swimming performance decreases with increasing glochidia load which could be an effect of increased oxygen demand for a given activity or reduced capacity to take up oxygen due to damage on gills in heavily infested fish and Geist After infestation glochidia are fully enveloped in the gill tissue typically the filament and Millemann as a consequence of shape change and migration of gill epithelial cells without signs of hyperplasia et al After a few days following encystment the ultrastructure of cysts and normal gill tissue is very similar et al However filaments with encysted glochidia are on average thicker and longer than normal filaments et al The lamellae of the filaments often fuse with the wall of the cyst and while blood still flows through these lamellae they may not function to the same extent for respiration and Millemann Glochidia can also pinch arterioles restricting blood flow to certain filaments and large cysts increase the physiological dead space in the water flow across the gills and Millemann Our results where basal oxygen consumption first increases at low glochidia loads and then decreases again with increasing load indicates that higher numbers of glochidia may restrict oxygen uptake by the gills and a mechanism for this effect may be restriction of blood flow or respiratory functional surface Indeed previous data show that brown trout infested with high numbers of glochidia take longer to reach basal ventilation rates after a stressor suggesting that high glochidia loads indeed constitute a respiratory burden et al If gill parasites reduce oxygen uptake from the gills an adaptive response to parasite attachment could be to increase the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen e g through increasing the number of erythrocytes or haemoglobin et al Although there are indications that this may be occurring in the present study e significantly higher Hct in infested brown a more extensive haematological evaluation of infested and uninfested fish is necessary to validate this hypothesis A word of caution is warranted as oxygen uptake and Hct may reflect differences in the trout phenotypes with infested fish having a generally higher metabolism and activity which in turn may have caused an increased exposure to glochidia in the wild et al Therefore the effect of glochidia on oxygen uptake capacity should be further investigated in future studies using artificially infested fish with natural levels of glochidia encystment However our findings still reflect the physiological status of infested and uninfested fish within the stream ecosystem and when used in combination with results from the previous studies outlined above et al Thomas et al it seems likely that the effects seen in our study are indeed caused by glochidia encystment The natural glochidia loads in this study are notably lower than the loads where adverse effects are noted in previous studies Juvenile brown trout examined in the present study were captured approximately months after initial glochidia infestation compared to e g as the fish studied by Taeubert and Geist It is likely that heavily infested fish have been outcompeted or suffered high mortality rates during a longer time period et al Taeubert and Geist explaining the relatively low number of encysted glochidia found on the fish in this study Additionally many glochidia are sloughed off the gills during the initial period of encystment as the immune system responds to glochidia infection and Young Hence this may also lead to a decrease in encysted glochidia in host fish populations over time When artificially infesting trout with glochidia in mussel conservation programmes the recommended load on the host fish is between and glochidia per gram body mass and Geist The fish in our study are well within this recommended span and we therefore note with support from other studies on behaviour et al et al et al that the higher loads within this span may also be affecting the host fish negatively to the potential detriment of the mussel glochidia Based on our findings we reiterate the conclusion that artificial glochidia infestation of fish within pearl mussel propagation programmes should be done with care and aim for relatively low glochidia encystment rates This could avoid detrimental effects on host fish which may translate into unsuccessful deployment of juvenile mussels into the stream where the infested fish are released and Geist Thomas et al Acknowledgements We thank Fredrik Wahlqvist for assistance in the field and Kellermann for assistance when conducting respirometry

public hospitals in Kenya We used a qualitative case study approach to examine these processes in two hospitals in Kenya We collected data by interviews of national level policy makers hospital managers and frontline practitioners in the case study hospitals n a review of documents and observations within the hospitals over a month period We applied an evaluative framework that considers both consequentialist and proceduralist conditions as important to the quality of processes The budgeting and planning process in the case study hospitals was characterized by lack of alignment inadequate role clarity and the use of informal criteria With regard to consequentialist conditions the hospitals incorporated economic criteria by considering the affordability of alternatives but rarely considered the equity of allocative decisions In the first hospital stakeholders were aware of and somewhat satisfied with the budgeting and planning process while in the second hospital they were not Decision making in both hospitals did not result in reallocation of resources With regard to proceduralist conditions the budgeting and planning process in the first hospital was more inclusive and transparent with the stakeholders more empowered compared to the second hospital In both hospitals decisions were not based on evidence implementation of decisions was poor and the community was not included There were no mechanisms for appeals or to ensure that the proceduralist conditions were met in both hospitals Public hospitals in Kenya could improve their budgeting and planning processes by harmonizing these processes improving role clarity using explicit criteria and by incorporating both consequentialist equity stakeholder satisfaction and understanding shifted priorities implementation of and proceduralist engagement and empowerment transparency use of evidence revisions enforcement and incorporating community conditions budgeting and planning deliberative democracy hospitals Kenya Introduction Hospitals consume a significant proportion of recurrent national health budgets and are avenues for the delivery of key interventions English et al Understanding how these hospitals set their priorities and the factors that influence their allocation of resources is therefore imperative Martin et al However research has mainly focused on macro and micro level processes and rarely on the meso and or level particularly hospitals Martin et al Further of the few studies examining the hospital level the majority have been carried out in high income countries Barasa et al There is therefore a dearth of literature on hospital level practices in LMICs This is consistent with a general lack of evidence on priority setting frameworks and their usefulness in LMICs Wiseman et al This paper focuses on practices in public hospitals in Kenya In after a national election that ushered in a new government the country transitioned into a devolved system of government with a central government and units called counties Government of Kenya Under this new governance structure the public healthcare delivery system is organized into four tiers namely the community level primary care level county referral hospitals and national referral hospitals Ministry of Health County referral hospitals which are the focus of this study are first level referral hospitals in the county health systems Little is known about how the Kenyan health sector sets its priorities At the macro level it has been reported that priority setting is ad hoc rather than systematic without explicit priority setting criteria Ndavi et al The sector is guided by a long term national health policy which outlines health sector objectives and a short term national health sector strategic plan which articulates sector strategies aimed at achieving the policies laid out in the national health policy The health sector strategy outlines a package of health services that are to be provided by the public sector known as the Kenya essential package of health Ministry of Health Hospitals were therefore expected to provide KEPH services but had the authority to prioritize across these services On paper the Ministry of Health employed a combination of and bottom up planning to operationalize the sector strategy Ndavi et al There are no official guidelines in place on how the priority setting should be conducted at the county hospital level There is also no evidence literature on how the priority setting process is actually carried out within hospitals in Kenya We used a case study approach to examine practices in two of these hospitals Specifically this paper presents a description and evaluation of the budgeting and planning process in the case study hospitals The budgeting and planning process was selected because it is in theory the major expression of identified and selected hospital priority activities and services with allocation of available resources against those activities Methods This study employed a qualitative case study design A case study has been defined by Yin as an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real life context A case study approach is considered suitable to inquiries into phenomena that are highly contextual and where the boundaries between what is being studied and the context are blurred Yin It has been observed by several authors that priority setting practices in hospitals are highly context dependent Kapiriri and Martin Martin and Singer Gibson et al The case study approach is useful in building an understanding of the contextual influences on the phenomena of interest Yin de Lange and Flyvbjerg The case study approach is also considered appropriate for the study of complex social phenomena Yin de Lange and Flyvbjerg Priority setting is considered a complex social process that confronts decision makers with significant theoretical political and practical obstacles Hauck et al Shayo et al Klein As observed by Flyvbjerg social processes are complex and unlikely to yield universal truths or accurate predictions An appropriate analysis should therefore aim to develop concrete context dependent knowledge Flyvbjerg These context specific insights could then be tested and examined in other contexts in an iterative process of knowledge building Two county hospitals were purposely selected as cases for the study The two hospital cases were selected purposefully guided by the following criteria First level referral hospitals that were designated as county hospitals with a high local resource level and those with a low local resource level This was based on an assumption that practices might be influenced by the level of funding In the financial year preceding data collection one of the case study hospitals had an annual budget of USD while the other had an annual budget of USD These budgets remained fairly stable over the past years In line with case study methodology the selection of hospital cases aimed to ensure depth in information as opposed to aiming for representativeness of all county hospitals in Kenya To maintain confidentiality and minimize the potential identification and possible victimization of study participants the hospitals selected for the study will only be identified as Hospital A and B Data were collected through a combination of interviews with hospital managers and frontline workers a review of relevant documents including hospital plans budgets minutes of meetings and observations for a total period of months in both hospitals The selection of participants for interviews was purposive with the aim of selecting those who had an knowledge and experience of the budgeting and planning process This included senior managers middle level hospital managers frontline practitioners and key informants within the planning departments of the central Ministry of Health In total participants were from Hospital A from Hospital B and from the central Ministry of Health Table This study was broadly guided by the approach proposed by Martin and Singer on improving in healthcare organizations This approach proposes that efforts to improve in healthcare organizations should entail Martin and Singer critical description of processes using case study evaluation of using an ethical framework and action research to improve based on the findings in the first two steps While this paper focuses on step one and two it is part of a wider action learning study to improve governance and accountability in the county health systems in which the case study hospitals are located To evaluate the budgeting and planning process in the case hospitals we applied a published evaluative framework that was developed from a review of literature on evaluation Barasa et al Our evaluative framework is based on the argument that both consequentialist and proceduralist conditions are important for successful Barasa et al The framework brings together these two perspectives by drawing on ethical and deliberative democratic frameworks such as the for framework Daniels as well as consequentialist conditions of Barasa et al This integrated evaluative framework makes the following proposals Figure First given that is necessitated by the scarcity of resources processes should incorporate efficiency considerations by seeking to maximize outcomes within the constraint of available resources Second the goal of maximizing desired outcomes should be against equity To achieve equity the distribution of resources should be determined by need rather than other factors such as ability to pay favouritism or political consideration Third other intermediate outcomes of processes are also important These include Stakeholder Stakeholder Shifted resources and Implementation Fourth the following proceduralist conditions should be incorporated in practices stakeholder use of enforcement and incorporation of community values Data analysis Transcribed data were imported into NVIVO for coding and analyzed using a modified framework approach Pope et al This approach was adopted because it is suited to providing findings and interpretations that are relevant to policy and pragmatic recommendations The approach included an initial open coding step to support the emergence of important themes which might not have been captured in the evaluative framework described above Ethical considerations The authors received ethical approval from their organization Findings Description of the budgeting and planning processes Hospital structure The case study hospitals did not have an official organogram However observations and discussions with hospital managers and staff identified the existence of a management structure which was highly hierarchical Figure At the lowest level were frontline healthcare workers as pharmacists medical doctors and and staff as accountants and maintenance all of whom were answerable to the heads of their respective departments These heads of departments were middle level managers for clinical departments g paediatrics obstetrics and wards g adult male adult female and departments g pharmacy and and support departments g accounts and who were themselves answerable to the three senior hospital managers namely the medical superintendent the hospital administrator and the hospital nursing officer The medical superintendent was the chief executive of the hospital and was responsible for the overall running of the hospital The hospital nursing officer was in charge of the nursing department and hence all nursing wards in charges The hospital administrative officer was in charge of all the hospital departments The case study hospitals had management and committees First there was a hospital management team comprised of all hospital departmental managers level and senior managers Second there was an executive expenditure committee comprised of only the senior managers and third there was the hospital management committee which was an oversight committee that drew its membership from the local resident community The hospital was represented in the HMC by the medical superintendent who was also its secretary and the hospital administrative officer Budgeting and planning process The budgeting and planning process was comprised of two distinct quarterly budgeting and the annual work planning process The development of the hospital budget and the AWP were designed to be linked and aligned At the beginning of each government fiscal year hospitals were required to develop and submit AWPs to the central Ministry of Health for approval Hospitals were then required to develop quarterly budgets that outlined the allocation of available resources to the priorities indicated in the AWPs Hospital AWPs were developed by the HMT and submitted to the regional office for onward transmission to the central Ministry of Health for approval While the range of services provided by hospitals was guided by KEPH hospital managers had autonomy to allocate available resources across service areas e prioritize across these The budgeting process should begin at the hospital department level where departmental managers develop a list of departmental needs and present these to the HMT The HMT then deliberates on the departmental needs and develop budgets that allocate available cash budgets across hospital departments These budgets should then be deliberated upon and finalized by the EEC and subsequently presented to the HMC for review and approval Budgets approved by the HMC should then be submitted to the regional level and from there submitted to the MOH for approval of the budgeting and planning process While the budgeting and planning process was expected to be linked and aligned in practice this was not the finding in both case study hospitals The AWP was developed almost one quarter in the planning year while the budgets were developed on time at the beginning of every quarter This meant that the first budget of the year was often developed without the existence and hence any reference to the AWP Subsequent budgets were also developed without reference to the AWP The result was that activities budgeted for in the quarterly budgets were dissimilar to activities planned and budgeted for in the AWP As a result of this hospital managers placed little importance to the AWP process Very few managers knew what was contained in the AWP very few participated in the process and hardly any cared about implementing the AWP People just fill the template very fast but they even know what they are putting in the plans If you ask people you did the AWP some three months ago do you remember what you did Most of the people have an idea tell you did it and it has already been sent to the province We finished that business Middle level manager Hospital A criteria Formal and informal criteria were used to allocate budgets Formal criteria are objective criteria that were used explicitly by hospital decision makers to determine how the hospital budget was allocated across departments and or services Informal criteria refer to subjective considerations which were often implicitly employed that influenced budget allocation decisions in hospitals To get an idea of the prominence of criteria used in the case study hospitals we developed a word cloud by identifying criteria mentioned in interview transcripts and the number of times they were mentioned Figure The criteria identified will be discussed next Formal criteria In both case study hospitals the dominant criterion used to allocate budgets to hospital departments and services was the revenue generating potential of the departments Departments or services that generated more revenue from user fee collections were prioritized over departments that generated less revenue and subsequently received a larger share of the hospital budget The reason given for using the revenue generating potential of departments is that the hospitals experienced a severe scarcity of resources and relied on user fee collection to finance their daily operations Barasa et al To make sure that the hospital continued to run resources had to be allocated in a manner that assured further generation of revenues The hospital generates very little money which means priorities have to first we want to make money we allocate where we can make level manager Hospital B Historical budgeting also featured prominently among the criteria used by managers to allocate budgets across departments in both hospitals Departments often received the same budgetary allocation or increments to previous budgets The lack of technical competence in budgeting and planning and lack of guidelines together with resource scarcity also contributed to the use of historical budgeting et al in Managers also considered the extent of necessity of a service in making budgetary allocation decisions Services were considered essential if the hospital could not run without them The perceived medical need in the catchment area was also a determinant of hospital allocations The need was however based on the volume of patients seeking different services at the hospital rather than any formally assessed need in the community Other formal criteria used included international and national priorities such as the Millennium Development Goals the feasibility of implementing the service and affordability of proposed services Informal criteria In contrast to the formal criteria identified above managers in Hospital A felt that allocative decisions were influenced by informal criteria such as the lobbying and bargaining ability of departmental managers You see you can have a head of department who is not very vocal and does not articulate your needs as well as they seem to always get more than all depends on how eloquent and convincing the head of department presents his proposals Middle level manager Hospital A Resource allocation was also dependent on interpersonal relationships and mutual benefit between the managers and the senior managers Allocations depend on your relationship with the hospital mean in life sometimes things work because of relationships right You are a friend of mine and we get along well so we will allocate something to you Middle level manager Hospital A Middle level managers at Hospital A also felt that allocations favoured the senior managers who were part of the EEC The use of these informal criteria was made possible in Hospital A because there was little deliberative space in the budgeting process Given that actual allocation decisions were made by a small group of senior managers this provided an opportunity for the EEC managers to leverage on their unique position to favour their departments and the departments of those with whom they enjoyed good relationships The situation was different in Hospital B where the middle level managers through the HMT were empowered to make allocation decisions While managers in this hospital also felt that the bargaining and lobbying ability of managers had an influence the general feeling was that favouritism did not influence decisions The result was that while in Hospital A managers generally felt that the allocation decisions were unfair in Hospital B the feeling was that allocations were relatively fair We get all that we need but we can say that the budgeting is fair The medical superintendent ensures there is equity At least each department gets something small Middle level manager Hospital B Evaluating In this section we use the framework that we previously developed Barasa et al to evaluate the budgeting and planning process in the case study hospitals We first present our findings on the use of consequentialist principles followed by the adherence to proceduralist conditions The use of consequentialist principles Efficiency and equity Hospital managers were unfamiliar with mechanisms such as analysis and program budgeting and marginal analysis When the basics and rationales of these methods were explained to them they responded that although the methods were potentially useful in they lacked the technical skills and data required However in both hospitals budgeting and planning decisions considered the affordability of competing alternatives This could be argued to be an attempt to incorporate efficiency given the capacity and data constraints that the hospitals faced By taking into account the costs and affordability of competing priorities managers were recognizing budget limitations and the need to make decisions such that the hospital could get the most out of available resources In both case study hospitals the dominance of revenue maximization as a criterion meant that departments hence patient groups such as children under that did not generate user fee revenues were systematically underfunded compared to departments that generated user fee revenues This practice meant that budget allocations were inequitable Further the reported favouritism in resource allocation given to departments headed by senior managers and those whose managers enjoyed good relationships with senior management could also be considered as sources of inequity Stakeholder satisfaction The level of satisfaction with the budgeting and planning process varied between hospitals In Hospital A stakeholders and middle level managers and frontline were not satisfied with the budgeting and planning process because the process was generally not inclusive leaving most disgruntled Further the scarcity of resources meant that hospital managers were not satisfied with the resources that were allocated to them The use of revenue generation criterion also left the managers whose departments generated little revenue disgruntled In Hospital B the stakeholders reported having some level of satisfaction with the budgeting and planning process While they were unhappy with the limited availability of resources they seemed to understand the scarcity situation It appeared that this general satisfaction with the process was due to the fact that they were included in the budgeting and planning process However managers of departments with low revenue generating potential like in Hospital A were unhappy with the process Stakeholder understanding The level of understanding varied across stakeholders and was related to their level of engagement For example while in Hospital A the middle level managers had a low level of understanding of the budgeting process given that they were excluded from it in Hospital B the middle level managers reported adequate understanding of the process because they were involved in it Shifted priorities of In both case study hospitals budgeting and planning processes did not result in shifted resources This was because budgeting and planning in these hospitals was significantly guided by historical allocations The budgeting and planning process was therefore not responsive to the changing dynamics of resource needs Implementation of decisions The implementation of budgeting and planning decisions was fairly similar between the case study hospitals The planning processes in both hospitals were considered to be mainly an activity on paper that was hardly implemented in practice A number of reasons which we have reported elsewhere led to the lack of implementation of decisions including the lack of resources reduced motivation due to reduced autonomy of hospital managers over planning decisions a culture where hospital staff lacked a sense of duty and commitment to their roles and responsibilities and the lack of strong internal accountability mechanisms et al in Compliance with proceduralist conditions Stakeholder engagement The degree of stakeholder engagement varied across the case study hospitals with the budgeting and planning process being more inclusive in Hospital B compared to Hospital A While hospital budgets were discussed by the HMT in Hospital A final budgeting decisions were made by the EEC Given that the EEC was a smaller committee that comprised of senior managers only middle level managers felt excluded from the budgeting process In Hospital B however as mentioned above final budgeting decisions were made by the HMT which was a larger committee that comprised of both senior and middle level managers The HMT meetings also allowed for greater deliberation and discussion We present budgets and people are asked to say why they need the money At least we get to understand why a budget is like this or like that People also see why for example they are going to get less than what they asked because we also discuss what is available and how much departments can get Middle level manager Hospital B In both hospitals however frontline clinicians rarely participated in budgeting and planning processes While it was reported that they were not invited in Hospital A frontline clinicians did not participate in Hospital B despite being invited As we have discussed elsewhere it appeared that the main reason for of clinicians was professional identity et al in Clinicians in both hospitals did not seem to think that managerial responsibilities such as budgeting and planning were part of their roles as professionals They identified themselves more with their clinical roles and considered time spent doing managerial duties as et al in The shortage of clinical staff also contributed to the of clinicians in budgeting and planning meetings et al in As will be discussed below community members were involved only very peripherally in the budgeting and planning processes in both case study hospitals Stakeholder empowerment The level of empowerment of different stakeholders varied between the case study hospitals In Hospital A middle level managers appeared to have a low level of empowerment to participate in budgeting and planning activities compared to Hospital B Decision making is not democratic I think dictatorial because at the end of the day whatever decisions are made at HMT meetings still going to hear of another meeting that was held with another committee and basically whatever we had come up with will not even be considered Middle level manager Hospital A Further actors who were not engaged in the process and the were clearly not empowered to contribute to decision making either Transparency The extent to which the budgeting and planning process was transparent varied between the case study hospitals Generally Hospital B exhibited more transparency In Hospital A there was no mechanism in place for disseminating budgeting and planning decisions and once the final budgets and AWPs had been prepared they were not shared with the hospital managers Only selected senior managers had access to these documents and for both processes the reasons for decisions were not communicated to the managers Front line practitioners also reported that they were in the dark as far as budgeting and planning decisions in the hospital were concerned In Hospital B a more inclusive budgeting and planning process meant that managers were generally more aware of the budgeting and planning decisions and the rationales behind them They therefore reported that the process was transparent Nevertheless as with Hospital A they reported that final budgets and work plans were not made available to them unless they individually sought them out Use of quality information In both case study hospitals decisions were rarely made based on information evidence Information was gathered using formal channels such as the hospital management information system but ignored Decision makers often used their gut feeling and hearsay as the basis for When information was used the use was more symbolic rather than functional Decisions were first made and then information was sought to justify the decisions One of the reasons given for the low use of information was that the quality of information available was questionable Managers reported that data captured in clinic registers often had gaps and did not capture all events They also complained that the data captured in clinic registers were inaccurate Revisions In both case hospitals the budgeting and planning process did not have a provision for a formal appeals and revision process Once the quarterly budget or the AWPs had been prepared and approved they could not be changed or altered over the course of the planning period This meant that the process was inflexible and could not be improved with emerging information It also meant that there was no formal avenue for parties to contest planning and budgeting decisions Community values In both case hospitals community views were obtained through two mechanisms namely the suggestion box and community representatives in the HMC Both mechanisms were however felt to be ineffective as mechanisms for channelling community views In both case study hospitals the suggestion box was hardly ever opened by the hospital administration The incorporation of community representatives in the HMC was also shown to be an ineffective mechanism for obtaining community values in both hospitals This mechanism was shown to have two main shortcomings First the method of appointing community representatives into the committee was not thought to be transparent and inclusive Senior hospital managers were perceived to influence the selection process to appoint preferred individuals who were then thought to simply hospital decisions The community representatives in this committee were therefore not empowered to ask questions and contribute to Discussion This study is the first in Kenya and one of very few in LMIC settings that examines processes in hospitals One of the key findings was the lack of alignment of the budgeting process and the annual work planning process between budgets and sector priorities has been identified as a reason for Kenya failing to achieve health sector targets et al This appears to be a downstream manifestation of the observed lack of coordination and harmonization of the budgeting and planning processes for the health sector with the central MOH et al It is imperative that planning and budgeting processes are integrated and harmonized by for example ensuring that the same set of actors and administrative units within the county departments of health drive the process and by harmonizing the timelines for the two processes such that budgeting is carried out only after therefore draws the planning process A second observation was the lack of clarity about the roles and composition of the different decision organs in the case hospitals The importance of clarifying roles of bodies has been highlighted in literature Gibson et al Role clarity in the county hospitals could be improved by developing official hospital organograms with clear terms of reference for each position in the structure and specification of the composition of management committees A third observation concerns the appropriateness of the criteria used to set priorities It has been pointed out in literature that the criteria used to set healthcare priorities should be clearly defined and understood by stakeholders and Gibson et al The dominant criteria used to set priorities in both case study hospitals are the revenue generating potential of the department These criteria are seen to promote the inequitable allocation of budgets which resulted in frustration and reduced motivation among hospital staff et al in The use of informal criteria to set priorities also stands out as an area of concern While this observation was more prominent in Hospital A it was minimized in Hospital B largely because of the leadership style of the hospital superintendent et al in The use of informal criteria to set hospital priorities is consistent with findings in a number of settings For example in a case study of practice in a public hospital in Uganda it was reported that departments whose leaders knew how to use up their or their were usually prioritized Kapiriri and Martin In these settings it was reported that the absence of data led to the use of informal or arbitrary considerations in decision making Gordon et al While this is also true of the case study hospitals it also emerged that multiple additional factors had led to the use of informal criteria including the absence of explicit guidelines to guide budgeting and planning The use of informal criteria is seen to result in perceptions of unfairness The case study hospitals could minimize these unwanted consequences by adopting and implementing systematic and explicit criteria that hospital actors agree on Strengthening hospital information systems to provide reliable information for could also reduce the use of informal criteria A number of key issues emerge from the evaluation of the budgeting and planning process in the case hospitals The use of economic methods such as CEA and PBMA was hampered by a lack of both technical capacity and reliable data This is consistent with the literature on in other settings Barasa et al Hauck et al Managers in the case study hospitals appreciated the rationale of incorporating economic considerations in processes and attempted to do this by using the affordability criteria This was perhaps a more pragmatic approach in this and similar settings processes in settings with resource capacity and data challenges could incorporate efficiency considerations by assessing the affordability and budget impact of competing priorities alongside their effectiveness Further while equity was a concept that hospital actors related to there was no systematic attempt to incorporate it It is imperative that there is an explicit requirement that allocation of resources in hospitals be based on need give priority to the worse off and is transparent about where such considerations are traded off with efficiency With regard to intermediate outcomes of the budgeting and planning processes stakeholders in Hospital B were more satisfied and better understood the budgeting and planning processes compared to Hospital A because the process in the latter was more inclusive and deliberative eliciting perceptions of transparency and fairness The fact that stakeholders were included in Hospital B made them appreciate the reality of resource scarcity which in turn resulted in their being more understanding of the situation This highlights the relationship between procedural conditions and intermediate outcomes and the importance of both In both hospitals however the budgeting and planning processes often did not lead to shift resources due to the fact that hospitals relied on historical allocations The use of historical budgeting means that the hospital budgeting and planning process was not responsive to the dynamic healthcare priorities of the communities that they serve It also served to entrench historical inequities in the allocation of resources within the hospitals To improve hospitals should adapt criteria that are responsive to hospital needs and health system goals as burden of disease effectiveness and rather than historical budgeting The implementation of planning decisions in both case study hospitals was also seen to be unsatisfactory This was attributed to among others of budgets and plans and lack of internal accountability mechanisms to follow up and ensure that plans and budgets are implemented It is imperative that hospitals strengthen their internal accountability mechanisms by among others introducing and enforcing a system of tracking and monitoring the implementation of budgets and holding hospital managers accountable by a system of rewards and sanctions With regard to procedural conditions the case hospitals could improve their budgeting and planning processes by ensuring that the relevant range of stakeholders are included in the process Notable exclusions in both hospitals were frontline clinicians and the public This is consistent with the literature on hospital level Barasa et al This exclusion calls into question the legitimacy of the processes and resulted in perceptions of unfairness et al in One way of improving the inclusivity of the process in Kenyan county hospitals is to ensure that actual budgeting decisions are made in a more inclusive organ such as the HMT rather than the more exclusive EEC Closely related to this the range of actors excluded from budgeting and planning processes also appear to be less empowered to contribute to This exclusion is a function of unclear or sometimes lacking guidelines and systems and also of micropractices of power among hospital actors et al in press It is imperative that hospitals specify systematic processes that clearly outline the procedure roles of actors and composition of organs Such a system should ensure that the relevant range of actors are included the process is deliberative and mechanisms to empower actors are put in place et al in As has been discussed elsewhere hospital leadership also plays an important role in ensuring the effectiveness of deliberative processes by actively ensuring that processes are inclusive and managing the power dynamics among actors with varying levels of influence et al in Transparency is also seen to be a sticky issue in both hospitals with perceptions of lack of transparency being worse in Hospital A To improve transparency case study hospitals will need to improve communication and provide information about hospital budgeting decisions and their rationales to all relevant actors This information should be made easily accessible to these actors and also actively pushed to them In both case study hospitals budgeting and planning processes did not use evidence to make decisions but rather relied on personal experience and hunches Improving the quality of information information systems and requiring that budgeting and planning decisions be backed by evidence would improve this in the short term In the long term however there is a need to focus on changing the culture of hospital managers to place more importance on evidence based decision making Related to this and consistent with findings in most settings there is no formal process for revisions For hospital processes to be responsive to the changing dynamics of information and needs it is imperative that there is a mechanism that allows for budgets and plans to be amended in light of new information In both case study hospitals there is no systematic and effective mechanism to elicit and incorporate community values in the budgeting and planning process If we accept the idea that hospitals are a social institution then the lack of a mechanism to incorporate community values begs the question of the legitimacy and responsiveness of the hospital budgeting and planning processes et al in County hospitals in Kenya should incorporate participatory community engagement mechanisms such as the incorporation of community members in hospital planning committees the use of citizen juries Lenaghan or planning cells et al The selection of community representatives in these mechanisms must however be seen to be transparent and fair The proposal for implementing and or strengthening community engagement in decision making is not a new thing in Kenya The new Kenyan constitution requires that decision making at both the national and county levels involve and engage the public for their inputs Government of Kenya Further the Kenyan public finance law prescribes a mechanism that requires that the public budgeting processes at the national and county levels organize public forums to share and debate proposals before finalization of budgets Government of Kenya Extending this practice to health sector therefore has a precedent from public finance practice in Kenya Conclusion In this paper we have presented a description and evaluation of the budgeting and planning process in county hospitals in Kenya It is clear that to improve practices decision makers in charge of these hospitals will need to focus their attention not only on the content and outcomes of priority setting but also equally important on the process Fulfilling the consequentialist and proceduralist conditions of our evaluative framework especially is resource constrained settings may be challenging and will require making difficult We recognize these constraints and recommend that when making these decisions in addition to considering the required resources decision makers should also consider the merits of implementing a process that incorporates these conditions such improvement of the legitimacy of the decisions strengthening the responsiveness of decisions to local needs minimizing the range of disagreements and improving the quality of decisions Decision makers may therefore need to consider feasible ways of implementation while considering context For example hospitals could start by incorporating some of the conditions and then progressively add the other elements over time Also innovative ways could be used to improve feasibility and affordability For example a strategy to incorporate community engagement would perhaps be to integrate hospital community engagement initiatives with those already funded by the counties rather than having individual hospital initiatives One of the limitations of the study is that we did not interview community representatives who are a key stakeholder in processes While interviewing community representatives were beyond the scope of the study it would have enriched our findings especially with regard to their role and experiences of hospital processes Another limitation is the inability to generalize findings of a case study This this study in line with the intentions and characteristics of case study methodology provides insights that can be considered and tested in comparable settings Gilson et al Acknowledgement The authors are grateful to the staff of case

chemoradiotherapy underwent radical esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy for thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancers during Open thoracotomy was applied in and thoracoscopic surgery in Survivals according to TNM Stages and Efficacy index were analyzed Results Hospital death rates of O V were The survivals of V according to TNM Stages had significantly better prognosis in cStage III and showed not worse prognosis in general In the analysis using Cox proportional hazards model or was a significant prognostic factor indicating better prognosis of V More bilateral paratracheal lymph nodes along the recurrent laryngeal nerves tended to be classified as mediastinal instead of cervical in V Efficacy index of mediastinal paratracheal nodes was higher in V than in O while cervical lymphadenectomy maintained high EI Discussion and conclusion Though our series have limitations of retrospective study and substantial bias the feasibility and safety of thoracoscopic esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy was shown Higher paratracheal lymph nodes along the recurrent laryngeal nerves could be dissected from the mediastinal side in V group Thoracoscopic esophagectomy which is regarded as minimally invasive surgery in other countries is being accepted in Japan mainly in the expectation of more thorough and meticulous lymphadenectomy At the same time the dissection range is continuously for safer surgery maintaining radicality Keywords Esophageal cancer Thoracoscopic esophagectomy esophagectomy lymphadenectomy Minimally invasive surgery Squamous cell carcinoma The Japan Esophageal Society and Springer Japan Introduction In basic Japanese concept of multimodal treatment of esophageal cancer radical surgery plays the main role in control and wide range of thorough lymphadenectomy is believed to be mandatory The lymphadenectomy is accepted as the standard procedure for this purpose On the other hand thoracoscopic esophagectomy is rapidly prevailing in Japan About of esophagectomy in Japan is performed as thoracoscopic surgery Thoracoscopic esophagectomy is generally regarded and accepted as a minimally invasive surgery in western countries However most of thoracoscopic surgeons in Japan try to perform thoracoscopic esophagectomy as radical as their own open surgery and think that thoracoscopic esophagectomy is even advantageous in accomplishing meticulous radical surgery The purpose of this study was to clarify whether such high radicality was maintained and whether the value of lymphadenectomy had been changed with the introduction of thoracoscopic surgery Materials and method A total of consecutive patients who underwent curative radical esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy for thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancers during were first extracted for this study Ninety patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were excluded because NACRT which was applied to patients with bulky or suspicious tumors including metastatic lymph nodes seemed to be the largest bias between the groups of patients with open surgery and thoracoscopic surgery Consequently subjects of the study were patients in open thoracotomy group and in surgery group The open esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed as had been described by Akiyama The esophagectomy was done with essentially similar technique to what had been described by Osugi The esophagectomy was started in September of Survivals according to TNM Stages and Efficacy index metastatic rate were analyzed The characteristics of the subjects are listed in Table The sixth edition of TNM classification was applied in clinical TNM evaluation because number of clinically positive lymph nodes in preoperative staging was not available in patients before

Cervical O V Mediastinal O V Abdominal O P V exact test Discussion Thoracoscopic esophagectomy which is regarded as minimally invasive surgery in other countries is being accepted in Japan very rapidly According to the NCD report about of all esophagectomies performed in Japan in were done as surgery However most Japanese surgeons performing esophagectomy have the impression that the largest advantage of esophagectomy is not its less invasiveness but the expectation of more thorough and meticulous lymphadenectomy In our series most of the analyses on prognosis showed tendency of improvement with surgery Taking the large bias of this study design into account we feel at least we can conclude that the introduction of surgery has not worsened the prognosis of our radical esophagectomy Bilateral paratracheal lymph nodes which are also known as recurrent nerve chain nodes are most important nodes to be dissected in radical esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer They are uninterruptedly located from the mediastinum to the cervical area Our data showed that more paratracheal lymph nodes tend to be dissected from mediastinal side and fewer nodes were dissected from the cervical side in thoracoscopic esophagectomy Consequently of mediastinal paratracheal lymph node stations are higher in V group than in O group The large increase in EI of the station from O to V might show not only the fact that more nodes including nodes in more cervical location can be dissected but also that more complete lymph node dissection of this station can be achieved in thoracoscopic surgery Although more nodes in cervical paratracheal station can be dissected from the mediastinal side as in thoracoscopic esophagectomy high EI value of cervical lymph node dissection is still maintained because of better survival of cervical patients in V group It might mean that the combination of mediastinal dissection cervical lymphadenectomy be superior to the combination of conventional open mediastinal dissection cervical lymphadenectomy in terms of completeness At least we can say that lymphadenectomy remains as the standard operative procedure even in the era of surgery and multimodal treatment Because this study is a retrospective study it should contain biases The largest limitations are that V group was operated later than and that the distribution of clinical and pathological factors of the patients in both groups was different The latter can be adjusted to some extent by stratifying patients according to these clinical and pathological factors However the former bias cannot be adjusted We are looking forward to the coming results of the phase III study among thoracoscopic esophagectomy and open esophagectomy Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for resectable advanced thoracic esophageal cancer is widely accepted in all over the world On the other hand preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery is regarded as standard in Japan This strategy has yielded very good prognostic result as shown here In this study patients with NACRT were excluded because it was strongly associated with advanced poorer prognosis and open surgery There is no direct evidence to compare NACRT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy particularly when the surgery includes extended lymphadenectomy Japan Esophageal Oncology Group is executing a randomized controlled trial to give answer to this question Conclusion lymphadenectomy pursuing best control by surgery is feasibly and safely performed as thoracoscopic surgery Thoracoscopic esophagectomy which is regarded as minimally invasive surgery in other countries has ability to realize more thorough and radical lymphadenectomy This phenomenon was observed in the area along the recurrent laryngeal nerves This increased radicality seems to improve survival of the patients operated thoracoscopically However clear evidence of superiority of thoracoscopic surgery to conventional open surgery cannot be obtained until a phase III trial on this issue such as JCOG becomes available Compliance with ethical standards Ethical Statement We authors of this manuscript of the role of thoracoscopic esophagectomy as a radical declare that our work conforms to the guidelines set forth in the Helsinki Declaration of as revised in and concerning Human and Animal Rights and that we

pharmacovigilance While this general concept has been proposed by many central questions remain as to whether social media can provide earlier warnings for rare and serious events than traditional signal detection from spontaneous report data Objective Our objective was to examine whether specific event pairs were reported via social media before being reported to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Methods A retrospective analysis of public Facebook and Twitter data was conducted for recent FDA postmarketing safety signals at the pair level with six negative controls Social media data corresponding to two years prior to signal detection of each pair were compiled Automated classifiers were used to identify each with resemblance to an adverse among English language posts A custom dictionary was used to translate Internet vernacular into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms Drug safety physicians conducted a manual review to determine causality using World Health Monitoring Centre assessment criteria Cases were also compared with those reported in FAERS Findings A total of posts were harvested from Facebook and Twitter from March through October The automated classifier identified Of these posts were selected for causality assessment of pairs Clinical assessment revealed that posts had sufficient information to warrant further investigation for two possible associations and Banana Boat burns No associations were found among the negative controls In one of the positive cases the first report occurred in social media prior to signal detection from FAERS whereas the other case occurred first in FAERS Conclusions An efficient approach to social media monitoring may provide earlier insights into certain adverse events More work is needed to elaborate additional uses for social media data in pharmacovigilance and to determine how they can be applied by regulatory agencies Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users http dx doi org U S Food and Drug Administration Dasgupta Nabarun Springer International Publishing Switzerland Key Points Previous work has established that social media can be a viable source for pharmacovigilance signals by drawing information directly from patients that may not have been otherwise reported to regulatory agencies or industry Of recent postmarketing safety signals from the US FDA public Facebook and Twitter posts showed mentions of one pair before cases were reported to the traditional spontaneous report system Social media can be an adjunct to traditional safety reporting systems to possibly uncover postmarketing safety signals more rapidly although considerations of noise and volume need to be further characterized Introduction Clinical trials are imperative for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new medical however because of patient selection criteria small sample sizes and short durations they provide limited information on rare harms As a result traditional clinical drug trials are not designed to detect rare adverse drug events This is exemplified by the fact that over of approved drugs have serious adverse events identified that are not detected before approval In addition existing postmarket AE reporting systems are significantly underutilized by clinicians and patients It has been estimated that as much as of adverse drug events go unreported to regulators The normative and burgeoning online representation of human knowledge and the corresponding growth of computing power to analyze unstructured information offer novel opportunities to access the variety of experience which has been referred to as disease when applied to health Adoption of social media tools and smartphones has surged The USA alone has million Facebook users and million Twitter users In the health domain specifically of US adults had looked online for health information in the past year and had gone online specifically to determine a medical condition A high volume of discussions about medical products is occurring online with patients using social media to publicly share concerns and reactions to medications There is increasing interest in exploring the use of social media data for pharmacovigilance but questions remain regarding how to validate and best leverage this data source The general benefits and limitations of using social media for pharmacovigilance have been reviewed extensively One area of research has focused on creating online electronic tools that may expedite case reporting by incorporating formats generally referred to as Data mining or case studies have established a base of applied examples of how generally unstructured online electronic sources can be used to derive drug safety information from news and social media commonly including Twitter Facebook patient forums news reports blogs and others Notable among these are studies evaluating online discussions of benfluorex antibiotics human papilloma virus vaccine and infertility oral antineoplastic drugs duloxetine agents and opioid analgesics a study by Coloma et al used assertion analysis to demonstrate a positive association between rosiglitazone and cardiovascular events in posts acquired from Twitter Data mining of web search logs has also been considered for pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance Data mining approaches to social media for pharmacovigilance have been published by other academic groups and evaluated in the conduct of the research presented here However an outstanding fundamental question is whether analysis of social media could lead to earlier detection of rare and serious AEs This is the objective of traditional spontaneous reporting and represents a use case by which to evaluate social media especially for regulatory purposes It was hypothesized that warnings of safety signals for US medications would have been generated earlier by monitoring social media in the period prior to the discovery of the safety signals via the current pharmacovigilance surveillance system the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System The objective of this study was to examine whether cases of specific pairs were reported in social media before they were reported to FAERS Methods Study Overview The main study outcome was to determine whether social media posts for selected pairs occurred prior to the date of the first FAERS case report and the date when the FDA first considered the reports in FAERS a potential safety signal The date of the potential safety signal was the time at which the FDA first determined through routine pharmacovigilance that evidence of a concern was sufficient and that a formal safety review would be required Retrospective social media data were acquired and processed to remove spam and duplicates and to identify AEs Causality assessment was conducted by an independent third party The study process was as follows pairs were identified for retrospective analysis Search terms were selected to identify products including brand and generic names and common misspellings Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Terms indicative of the symptomology of the MedWatch alerts were identified Queries were submitted to a vendor to gather historical data A dictionary was applied to convert the verbatim post text to MedDRA PTs Machine learning algorithms were run on the data to automatically identify with resemblance to adverse delete spam posts consolidate duplicates and remove personally identifiable information Symptomatic descriptors for each association were used to identify posts for manual review An experienced drug safety physician manually curated An independent medical reviewer conducted causality assessments on the resulting posts Social media data were reviewed for concordance with the dates provided by the FDA regarding when the safety signals were first identified using the standard signal detection processes Data Sources and Study Period The data source was English language public social media posts from Facebook and Twitter collected between March and October regardless of geographic location duration was the same for all pairs starting two calendar years before the first day of the month in which the FDA safety signal was first identified Social media data from public Facebook and Twitter posts were obtained from an authorized data vendor since an estimated of all Twitter accounts and of all Facebook accounts are publicly accessible The commercially available service provided the verbatim text of the body of the original post along with metadata such as timestamp a link to the original content and if available the gender and geographical information Posts that were truncated but still described AEs and contained links to original content g a Tweet that linked to a longer post on the discussion board MedsChats were followed to retrieve the full text The FDA provided the month and year that the selected safety signals were first identified through the use of routine monitoring of FAERS in combination with other routine data sources for pharmacovigilance Public data from FAERS were used to extract information on individual cases received by the FDA Public FAERS data do not contain case narratives so further information could not be used to determine exact date of onset or a detailed causality assessment See the Electronic Supplementary Material for a list of data elements that were available in the public FAERS dataset and used in this analysis Selection A total of safety signals identified between January and October retrieved from the FDA website were initially considered for use in the study The time period was selected based on the availability of historical social media data from a data vendor The final list selected for analysis resulted in pairs The final products were nine prescription medications and one consumer product See the ESM for a complete list of pairs considered for analysis Table pairs selected for analysis Drug Adverse event Month identified

controls by restricting the number of feasible negative controls The process for selecting negative controls is described in Sect reactions was eliminated because the amount of curation required to review the high volume of posts for and was too onerous to be feasible in this study Of note the safety signal for hydroxyzine was specific to an injectable formulation but all mentions of hydroxyzine were analyzed to reduce the possibility of missing reports by using search terms Selection of Search Terms The brand names and misspellings in Table were identified for each of the products of interest from a list of hypothesized spelling variants using the public Twitter search This is because drugs posted in social media can take on a variety of aside from being referred to by various brand names and active ingredients medical products can be misspelled or referred to in more general terms Any search term that resulted in more than posts was included To maximize ratio an additional search criterion was added to include any posts mentioning common misspelling of but to exclude a common French word because the concept is semantically unrelated to drug safety Table Search strings

banana boat aerosol For the purpose of identifying cases in FAERS which contains curated data with corrected misspellings products were searched for using properly spelled brand and generic names Selection of Controls The selection of negative controls was modeled after the approach taken by Harpaz et al while establishing a reference standard for adverse drug reactions This approach defines negative controls by randomly pairing each product that appeared in the set of positive controls with one event that appeared in the set of positive controls This process is repeated until each product is paired with at least one negative control event In addition we avoided assigning negative controls where the signs and symptoms indicative of the negative control medical concept may be associated with a indication and therefore may trigger a false positive FDA safety reviewers then checked product labeling to ensure that the events were not AEs listed in the product labeling for the randomly assigned negative control product The most recent product label in October that was available from the National Library of Medicine DailyMed site was used Of the resulting matches four were excluded because the AE was listed as an AE in the label for that drug The six resulting pairs were selected as negative controls dabigatran etexilate and phenomenon dimethyl fumarate and priapism

leukoencephalopathy Definitions We utilized a previously created colloquial symptom dictionary in the social media listening platform to map colloquial phrases in social media posts to MedDRA the international medical terminology developed under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use The MedDRA taxonomy comprises a hierarchy of terms and codes describing to varying degrees of specificity a wide range of medical conditions diagnoses treatments investigations and signs and symptoms The hierarchical levels are defined by degree of specificity starting at the most general Organ that describes or disorders The fourth level of specificity was chosen for this analysis A PT represents a distinct clinical concept and is routinely used in pharmacovigilance including in FAERS data As described elsewhere the colloquial symptom dictionary was developed over four years through a manual curation process When curators encountered vernacular terms in social media describing medical conditions the phrases were added to the dictionary The dictionary encompasses euphemisms g look like a codes to combined words in the form of hashtags in social media using the variations between American and British English misspellings abbreviations homonym confusion affixes g plural s past tense homographs heteronyms metonyms or synecdoche and other facets of semantics At the start of this study the colloquial symptom dictionary contained vernacular terms mapped to of the most common PTs Phrases are mapped to the MedDRA PT level since PTs represent distinct clinical concepts and are routinely used in pharmacovigilance including coding AEs in FAERS data Each colloquial phrase identified in social media describing a symptom was mapped to a MedDRA PT as described elsewhere For our study all PTs identified in this analysis for the AEs of interest were available in the colloquial symptom dictionary including all corresponding AE synonyms Another research group found low recall when using a approach The lexicon studied was optimized for searching biomedical literature As such we would not expect that specific lexicon to perform well in social media posts in Twitter and Facebook However the lexicon used in our analysis was specifically generated based on empirical observation of patient conversations in social media Therefore the results observed by Nikfarjam et al cannot be generalized to this study Case Detection The unit of analysis was a single post in Facebook or Twitter that mentioned both a product name and an AE Those AEs mentioned with a specific product are referred to as a term used to differentiate AEs described in social media posts from AE reports that have been vetted to meet the minimum regulatory requirement for reporting AEs such as those in FAERS are conceptually modeled on the regulatory reporting definition as we consider a network username to be similar to a patient identifier for a MedWatch report We identified standardized symptom lists and definitions that were used to consistently evaluate the identified in social media posts This was because patients were more likely to report signs and symptoms of an AE than a medical diagnosis To screen social media posts for cases for causality assessment symptoms related to the AEs of interest needed to be identified ESM to build an event profile for automated detection The process used was as follows If available Standardized MedDRA Queries were identified yielding definitions for two AEs angioedema and vasculitis All terms related to medical devices injection infusion implant stents vaccinations and syringes or needles were removed from the angioedema list because only solid oral formulations were under review among drug products Injection PTs were selected from the Extravasation events MedDRA SMQ To give preference to regulatory precedent on definitions the FDA website was searched search to identify additional definitions resulting in the identification of symptom lists for renal impairment and enteropathy If other definitions were still not available clinical reference books g Merck Manual and trusted medical websites g Mayo Clinic and National Institutes of Health were consulted and converted into MedDRA PTs The number of unique PTs for each condition varied angioedema had by far the highest number of symptoms Indicator Score Calculation A machine learning algorithm was employed to distinguish posts containing relevant drug safety information from posts This was achieved using a statistical approach for automated document classification that categorized each post as either a or a based on a manually coded training set using Certified MedDRA Coders as previously described This training set consisted of data collected from Facebook and Twitter between October and December using application programming interfaces made publicly available by Facebook and Twitter There was no overlap between the training set data and the study data This involved feature extraction a process by which each post was broken up into a set of discrete elements that were then tallied to determine the number of times each element occurred in posts that had been manually coded as and in posts that had been coded as To improve computational efficiency the text was parsed using a single tree structure based on the algorithm originally developed for HealthMap adapted to identify mentions of products and symptoms Loading the product and symptom taxonomies into a single tree structure enabled the post to be processed a single time to identify tokens that may have represented both products and symptoms Next all punctuation was removed and the post was divided into tokens comprising to phrases Finally each token was processed and matched against the vernacular dictionary Positive matches were established when a was reached in the tree and a phrase for either a product or a symptom was identified based on the taxonomy After the feature extraction algorithm was run on the input the classifier developed through statistical machine learning computation was applied to each post The model for the classifier was taken from approach to eliminating spam in email Using a Bayesian probabilistic model and drawing on a training dataset containing more than manually classified posts the software assigned each post an indicator score on a scale of to For each feature extracted from a post we calculated a probability score representing the likelihood that the post was a based on the manually classified corpus We then combined probabilities across features using the inverse function and calculated an overall indicator score as detailed below A score close to meant there was a low probability that the post was related to an AE discussion whereas a score close to indicated a high probability that the post was related to an AE discussion In general terms each new token was compared with the priors and two probabilities were calculated based on the number of times the token appeared in positive and negative posts in the manually classified priors Finally we empirically determined that if a post contained no identifiable symptom it was less likely to contain a true AE report To account for this and as a performance improvement measure we therefore deducted a penalty of from the indicator score if the post did not contain any identifiable symptoms The process for computing the probabilities combining them and producing an indicator score was as follows For each token w w of positives containing w number of w of negatives containing w number of p w b w b w g w p w is the probability that the document is a positive given that it contains word w To adjust for rare tokens i e phrases that did not occur frequently or at all in the training set the following statistical adjustment was undertaken f w s x n p w s n f w is a scaled or transformation of p w The weighting is based on priors as well as the frequency of w in the training set s assigned to background information x assumed probability of spam for unknown token n number of examples containing w Strength s and probability of positive x are priors and are considered neutral values for s and x in our implementation we used for the value of s and for the value of x These values were determined by experimentation namely checking performance metrics for a range of values and selecting the values yielding the best performance No formal optimization methodology was applied for this process Probabilities were derived using method of combining probabilities where C is shorthand for the inverse function H C ln w f w n Complementary probabilities were combined in this manner S C ln w f w n The indicator score was then calculated by averaging the combined probabilities with the inverse probabilities H I H S We average the positive score H and the negative score S to produce a bimodal distribution of indicator I values That is with the resulting distribution of I in our dataset we see large numbers of posts scoring either very low likelihood of or very high likelihood of and a smaller number scattered across the middle The middle of the distribution represents content that the algorithm determined to be ambiguous Since there is not enough human analyst time to check and reclassify all posts we can then focus our analyst efforts on posts falling in the middle of the distribution Second the nature of the distribution makes the performance less sensitive to the exact indicator threshold value since we place the threshold near the middle of the distribution Posts with indicator scores of were generally spam e g advertisements coupons or other posts containing text clearly generated by bots Posts with indicator scores were called An analysis of classifier performance suggested that optimal thresholds for removing irrelevant posts without excessively sacrificing true positives were indicator scores of to In the previous analysis posts with indicator scores of had a positive predictive value of approximately e of every posts would be relevant for drug while keeping of true AE posts Human Curation Given the nuanced nature of social media language previous experience has consistently suggested that review by a human curator is necessary on some posts that have been automatically identified as AEs by the classifier This process helps to remove false positives continuously improve the classifier and expand the symptom and product taxonomies This approach called learning introduces a feedback loop between the human curators and the automated classifier The high volume of data in this study meant it was not practical to manually review every therefore we established a threshold to identify potentially ambiguous posts that may require curation based on previous analysis of social media data using the machine classifier Posts with indicator scores of at least were reviewed by a team of human curators that included Certified MedDRA Coders and medical professionals with a focus on removing false positives called curation All curators received standardized training on curation methods for social media data according to the MedDRA coding standards and guidelines Standard MedDRA practices were used including objective coding without any attempt to interpret or infer beyond the stated text Curators receive annual refreshers as well as training on each new release of MedDRA Primary curation is an ongoing process that is conducted for drugs in the general however to prepare the data for causality assessment in this analysis an additional round of curation was needed Accordingly was then conducted to identify relevant posts of interest for the hypothesis in this paper An experienced drug safety physician reviewed posts that had undergone primary curation for a given drug that had any symptom g from the SMQ associated with the pair from positive associations and negative controls Posts that appeared to describe the pairs of interest were extracted for causality assessment For SMQs the presence of any symptom was not sufficient to trigger a positive the symptoms listed for SMQs in ESM are often As such it was left to the discretion of the physician reviewer to determine whether the constellation of symptoms described was sufficient for a plausible positive match Causality Review World Health Monitoring Centre criteria for causality assessment were assigned to each post identified during secondary curation To accomplish this the text of the post along with date and data source was sent to for independent review by an experienced senior medical officer Posts were classified as being or The differentiating factor between certain likely and possible was the presence of more granular and plausible time information elevated a case to certain as opposed to likely It was assumed that most social media posts would likely fall in the possible category since information is not routinely reported by patients Ethics Statement All social media data used in this analysis came from public sources Prior to causality assessment posts were stripped of personally identifiable information such as screen names user names first and last names and addresses A hybrid process was used to remove first and last names Using a containing a few hundred thousand names from a global database of values the software removed from the posts any names that were contained in the dictionary In addition pattern matching was used to remove structured information g phone numbers email that could lead to individual identification other than for the needs of manual review post text presented in this manuscript has been paraphrased and or altered in ways to protect patient identity and prevent unmasking using Internet search engines AE data from FAERS were also publicly available in an anonymized format Since all primary data sources used in the analysis were publicly available no institutional review board approval was sought Results Data Processing Results Figure represents the schematic flow of posts and steps taken in data cleaning as well as the number and percent of posts resulting from each process We started with an initial dataset of posts containing text of selected products These were posted on public Facebook and Twitter accounts from March to October Spam posts were identified and eliminated based on indicator scores than implying that the posts did not contain text that met our requirements e posts with the name of a product and only an emoticon or in This step resulted in the removal of about n of the remaining posts leaving a corpus of posts mentioning the products of interest Next verbatim duplicates n were consolidated A total of were then identified based on indicator scores of representing about of the remaining posts After primary and secondary manual curation which occurred over the course of three months posts were identified as possibly relevant and were then submitted for causality assessment This process resulted in six posts of interest that described certain probable and possible cases Fig Data processing results Public social media data were obtained for Facebook and Twitter with posts identified where each of the products under review were mentioned An automated classifier was used to remove spam followed by exclusion of verbatim duplicate posts Posts with an indicator score of were considered a with resemblance to an adverse and manually curated to remove false positives The resulting posts that mentioned associations from alerts or negative controls were assessed for causality by an independent third party Six posts contained certain probable and possible cases AE adverse event post with resemblance to an adverse event Comparison of Twitter and Facebook Data Volume of mentions varied considerably by product with controlled substances g lisdexamfetamine showing much higher volume due in considerable part to Internet pharmacy advertisements Mentions for the products of interest varied over time with rapid increases after new product launches g lisdexamfetamine and Surges in post counts generally tended to express excitement about the new products among patient communities but also included sales and stock price forecasts for finance audiences Most posts came from Twitter compared with Facebook Twitter generally yielded a higher volume of mentions overall due to the prevalence of pharmacy advertisements references to financial reporting and links to news articles or literature The percent of posts from Facebook varied from to fumarate The higher proportion of posts from Facebook for dimethyl fumarate originated from patients posting within open patient groups rather than individuals posting on their personal pages While Twitter typically generates more posts mentioning medical products Facebook data typically consists of posts with more detailed information post format and its numerous open patient groups provide a platform for patients to share their experiences without the character limits imposed by Twitter Fig Volume of mentions of selected products in public Twitter and Facebook social media data Mentions for the products of interest varied over time with rapid increases after new product launches black bars by year and higher volumes for controlled substances Fig Comparison of public Twitter and Facebook data for purposes of medical product safety surveillance Social media data from public Facebook and Twitter posts were analyzed A greater volume of posts originated from Twitter than from Facebook Results of Causality Assessment In total posts were submitted to for causality assessment The assessor was provided with the complete post of the text and told which pair was under examination for each The posts covered of the pairs identified in Table dimethyl and Banana Boat Sunscreen burns The manual curator assigned the following scores to each of the pair posts three unlikely three possible posts one probable three unlikely dimethyl one unlikely Banana Boat Sunscreen burns two certain posts Of the posts given the classification of unlikely the greatest limitation was that the vernacular language used was not specific enough to constitute a causal relationship with the paired condition For example one Twitter post stated severely allergic to to go to the hospital just hours after I took my dose The phrase did not adequately describe DRESS Similarly another post read doc wants me to try a new im fuckin terrified i dont wanna i almost lost my life a few times from it im the only person i know allergic to abilify and geodon In this instance lost my did not specifically suggest DRESS In a third example they took me off Geodon because I had an extreme attack last week and was trying to go into cardiac arrest that was fun again and to go into cardiac did not provide enough detail to determine a causal relationship to DRESS All three of these posts would be considered serious AEs and potentially useful information but they did not meet the strict intent of this analysis These posts were all reported in social media before the FDA signal threshold for had been reached from spontaneous reports For dimethyl a single Facebook post was identified from secondary curation that was eventually adjudicated by to be unlikely tried taking Tecfidera and it made me SO sick I thought I was gonna die Now thinking of switching to Tysabri but I tested positive for JC virus My index value was and the doctor told me that risk for PML was low at that range Just wondering if anyone else is JCV positive and doing well on Tysabri In this instance the link to PML could not be definitively established because no specific adverse drug reaction was being described However it is also worth noting that JC virus seropositivity is considered the differentiating risk factor for PML with this medication In strictly medical terms the combination of a positive JC virus test and sick I thought I was gonna may not be sufficient to describe PML but nonetheless implies a potentially severe and particularly inauspicious event experienced by the patient This post was reported in Facebook before the FDA signal threshold for dimethyl had been reached For dronedarone four specific posts mentioned symptoms that were consistent with vasculitis all observed in Twitter but two of these originated in a patient discussion board One example stated on mg of Multaq daily for almost weeks Four days ago noticed I had a rash on the palms of both my hands with dots that kind of look like small blood blisters This case was considered probable by the causality reviewer because of the realistic mentioned in the post The symptomology in the specific location of the extremities is a known characteristic of vasculitis with the description of small blood further confirming the suspicion Finally hypersexuality has long been associated with synthetic pharmaceutical stimulants from amphetamine to methylphenidate and others Identifying priapism cases specifically within a background of normative hypersexual references led to difficulty in drawing a causal link For example says one of the side effects of ritalin a hard cock LMFAO Since no pathology is described in this post the reviewer made the determination that it had unlikely causal connection The other two posts reviewed for this pair also had similar limitations Review of Social Media Posts The posts identified as a result of secondary curation appeared to be discussing symptoms associated with the pairs No posts were found to contain symptoms for the negative controls after curation The posts were associated with of the safety signals specifically vasculitis and skin burns resulting from Banana Boat Sunscreen Spray There did not appear to be specific symptomology discussed in social media for the other eight safety signals identified by routine surveillance methods Table Social media post text

next week Facebook posts and Twitter posts discussed this topic fueled initially by a local television morning news story on June Timing of Social Media Posts Compared with FAERS Reporting For the social media case was identified from Twitter on December No cases were identified in Facebook The first FAERS primary suspect drug case was received on July with signal detection reported by the FDA on April Four social media reports were evaluated as possible n probable n or certain n compared with unique Individual Case Safety Reports leading to signal detection by the FDA For Banana Boat burns the first social media case was identified from Twitter on June whereas the first Facebook case was identified on June The first FAERS case was received on June with signal detection reported later that month by the FDA Two social media reports were evaluated as possible or probable compared with one unique ICSR leading to signal detection by the FDA The FAERS data suggest that events occurred on May and June It is possible that the case reported in social media was the one that occurred on May but this cannot be verified Therefore only a single post count was attributed Discussion This analysis applied strict criteria for evaluating the usefulness of social media data in detecting serious AEs Despite the very specific nature of this analysis of the safety signals studied one was mentioned in social media data prior to meeting FDA signal detection thresholds whereas another appeared in FAERS prior to social media The events selected for this analysis were very specific diagnoses whereas patients are more likely to discuss their medical conditions in common terms and symptoms Therefore it was necessary to cast a wide net using a large collection of terms consisting of any symptom that could possibly be associated with the selected medical event This resulted in a very large number of collected posts that ultimately were deemed irrelevant to the of interest such as posts that referred to other products or individuals g that happened to have the same name as the chosen medical products The combined lexical and machine learning approach used in this analysis had a performance of sensitivity and positive predictive value This approach was selected on the basis of performance after comparison with other machine learning techniques A recent analysis using Twitter and one patient forum with a training set of posts to returned recall of and precision in the range of with a semantic by comparison in that analysis a lexical approach had recall and precision The causation scale is a high standard when applied to social media The drug and the AE must be well described and specific in addition to having plausible time relationships Possible confounders will reduce the likely causality When one considers the usefulness of trawling the Internet reviewers think of signals that describe serious happening and the is characterized cohesively enough to suggest the effect is shared by a few unique individuals more than Seriousness should therefore be a signal in its own right so that and to go into cardiac would be as important a signal as something with a suggestive causal link to a specified disease reviewers feel that they would always be interested in such reports when identifying and evaluating signals Perhaps these are the most important contributions from social an early serious concern is expressed about a drug harm before it is medicalized Why social media monitoring did not yield early safety concerns for the other eight pairs bears consideration One possible explanation is that the events used in this analysis were relatively severe and or serious and our assumption is that patients would have sought medical treatment for many of these outcomes Therefore there is a likelihood that a provider might find the event to be significant enough to report whereas a patient might consider a more severe diagnosis to be private information thereby increasing the chances of it being detected through formal reporting channels and not mentioned on social media Similarly many of the events involved in this analysis may have required formal medical diagnosis for detection or may require medical expertise to describe it to the extent that it might trigger a signal A previous study by the authors investigated concordance at the MedDRA SOC level between social media reports and FAERS data General disorders less were most commonly reported in social media with patients describing symptoms in more general terms e g implying that whereas some patients are keen to describe their side effects publicly many do not describe symptoms using the medical terminology needed to explicitly confirm a certain condition or diagnosis This research contributes to the literature by providing a scientific approach to identifying potential posts containing AE information using an automated process followed by structured manual review by drug safety physicians including a process for assessing causality using an international standard As we mentioned above the nature of the severe events selected for this analysis required us to rely on a large selection of terms for common signs and symptoms that would provide us with a large enough corpus from which to work This methodology might have been improved search results could have been much by developing an algorithm for each separate event of interest or product that assigned weights to each sign and symptom according to the likelihood that it would indicate the event of interest One unresolved key question is how to operationalize social media surveillance for regulated medical products Given the curation burden and the large volume of social media data prospective monitoring of all regulated products may have limitations Social media could be used to stimulate a safety assessment that the FDA was not already considering Some pharmaceutical companies have progressed to monitoring a portfolio of products but government agency monitoring of the pharmacopeia will require additional effort Whereas other researchers have developed more directly automated screening methods to identify potential posts of interest g a critical component of our study was to elucidate a process by which posts could be evaluated for causation within the existing global frameworks used by regulators and industry This process is a bridge between the computer science tools and existing pharmacovigilance methods A future can be envisioned of greater machine dependence but adjudication of causality is likely to remain a fundamentally human function Beyond this the results of this analysis elicit points for discussion First further research is needed to develop best practices and methods for determining what constitutes a in social media It can be hypothesized that higher signal thresholds than those used in traditional pharmacovigilance may be appropriate for signal detection in social media data as these data are not specifically intended to be used for reporting adverse drug reactions A line of interdisciplinary research has been initiated to explore alternative methods for quantitative signal detection using social media data in addition to an approach using proportional reporting ratios Second social listening for postmarketing safety surveillance is a new field and best practices are still being established There is some uncertainty on the appropriate use of these data from a regulatory and patient privacy point of view There are several technical limitations to this study that bear mentioning First there is inherent variability across data sources that can change rapidly over time This may include the types of people posting on a particular website and limitations caused by website characteristics g character In Facebook enacted a policy to no longer make verbatim text available for purposes citing privacy concerns This effectively makes the largest social network unavailable for future drug safety surveillance without special dispensation Other social networking sites may also make their data not public meaning it will be inaccessible using the methods described herein Second Internet vernacular may not accurately reflect a medical condition To alleviate this limitation the dictionary used for this study was able to pick up on many such peculiarities of language but some may have been missed Other researchers have proposed solutions to developing an exhaustive consumer health vocabulary which will be incorporated in future analyses Third there is the possibility that people may post the same information in multiple social media platforms As a result some duplication may exist However this was not apparent to curators while manually reviewing posts for this analysis Potential for duplication will need to be considered in the development of quantitative signal detection methodologies alongside the perennial problem that stems from the lack of an obvious denominator for rate calculation in spontaneously reported AE data Finally the manual curation steps described here were considered necessary to provide a medical understanding of the social media posts A practical limitation to including the human curation step is in the volume of reports that can be processed For example acetaminophen paracetamol products were not included in this analysis because the volume was too high for manual curation Specific investigations may need to consider approaches that rely more on automation Conclusion Although we do not foresee that social media monitoring will replace current spontaneous report systems we present one example of how social media listening even for rare and serious events can be modeled as an early warning system for emerging drug safety concerns In Cobert and Silvey commented live in electronically exciting in reference to the explosion of options for pharmacovigilance A decade and a half later we feel that their vision for the future of drug safety is being borne out and will continue to expand in coming years

supports the efficacy of prophylaxis in decreasing the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection among individuals especially when used in combination with other behavioural preventive methods Safety concerns about PrEP present challenges in the implementation and use of PrEP The aim of this review is to discuss safety concerns observed in completed clinical trials on the use of PrEP We performed a literature search on PrEP in PubMed global advocacy for HIV prevention Vaccine Advocacy database clinical trials registry http www clinicaltrials gov and scholar google using combination search terms concerns in the use of use as for PrEP and to identify clinical trials and literature on PrEP We present findings associated with safety issues on the use of PrEP based on a review of clinical trials on PrEP with results on safety and efficacy as at April We also reviewed findings from routine practice reports The pharmacological intervention for PrEP was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate emtricitabine in a combined form as Truvada or tenofovir as a single entity Both products are efficacious for PrEP and seem to have a good safety profile Regular monitoring is recommended to prevent toxic effects The main adverse effects observed with PrEP are gastrointestinal basically mild to moderate nausea vomiting and diarrhea Other adverse drug effects worth monitoring are liver enzymes renal function and bone mineral density PrEP as an intervention to reduce HIV transmission appears to have a safe profile in clinical trials It is recommended for widespread use but adherence monitoring and safety surveillance are critical in the phase to ensure that the benefits observed in clinical trials are maintained in use Springer International Publishing Switzerland Key Points Safety concerns about prophylaxis pose challenges in use that should not be overlooked Behavioural counselling and assurance of safety and efficacy are important components of prophylaxis safety surveillance is critical in the phase to ensure that the benefits observed in clinical trials are maintained Introduction At the end of the World Health Organization established that million people were living with human immunodeficiency virus with about million becoming newly infected in the year With this high prevalence of HIV acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the world the World Health Organization related the urgency and importance of novel effective and safe interventions in the prevention of HIV infection This became necessary in that preventive behavioural messages on abstinence faithfulness and condom use presented useful but limited impact as primary prevention on the spread of HIV This challenge is observed especially among people at high risk because these protective measures were not applied consistently Human immunodeficiency virus continues to be a major public health problem and it has claimed more than million lives so far In alone million died from causes worldwide The various management options for HIV including treatment prophylaxis and prevention of transmission have been integral in lowering HIV incidence but reaching out to individuals at substantial risk owing to lifestyle practices required newer specific preventive approaches prophylaxis is a powerful tool in curbing the transmission of HIV infection and it involves taking an antiretroviral pill daily in addition to other preventive behavioural measures to prevent HIV infection This is a protective mechanism used for individuals not diagnosed with HIV but who may be at substantial risk of becoming infected because of their lifestyle or as a partner in a relationship Results from clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of PrEP either used alone or in combination with other behavioural preventive methods where it has been shown that PrEP can reduce the incidence of HIV by up to or even more with strict adherence Based on results and evidence from PrEP trials the US Food and Drug Administration on July approved Truvada mg emtricitabine Sciences Inc Foster City CA as an effective medication for the prevention of HIV that could be sexually acquired and in all other types of possible HIV infection including injectable drug use This was followed with guidelines for the provision of PrEP in clinical settings issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and recently the World Health Organization also issued similar guidelines recommending PrEP as a prevention option for individuals at substantial risk for acquiring HIV In the CDC guidelines TDF alone based on positive results of substantial efficacy and safety in clinical trials with injectable drug use and heterosexual active adults was recommended as an alternative regimen for these populations but not for men who have sex with men because no efficacy studies were concluded as yet in the group Again the use of other antiretroviral medications for PrEP either in place of or in addition to TDF FTC or TDF alone is not recommended and finally the use of oral PrEP for sex or noncontinuous daily use is also not recommended The CDC also recommend in addition to regular testing for changes in status and adverse drug monitoring including renal function before the initiation of PrEP and regularly while on preventive therapy Routine bone mineral density monitoring was not recommended by the CDC There are several challenges in the implementation and use of PrEP These concerns include high costs safety screening toxicity arising from continuous use adverse drug reactions poor adherence possible abuse and the fear of decreased condom use as an additional protective method Poor adherence during PrEP is especially an important factor that may reduce effectiveness and lead to an increase in HIV infection rate with a possible development of strains and subsequent transfer among the population Factors that can affect adherence include adverse drug reactions regular or toxicity drug reactions at probable high intolerant doses or The ARV drugs presently recommended for oral PrEP are TDF or a combination of TDF FTC These medications have proven to be potent have a favourable resistance profile and are claimed to have limited adverse effects thus rendering them efficacious and safe for PrEP Some studies have also assessed the efficacy of a vaginal gel formulation of TDF and found it to be effective in reducing HIV transmission by Essential factors to be considered before using PrEP include a confirmed status with a normal renal function a negative hepatitis B status and absence of reduced BMD or a history of bone fractures bone loss and osteoporosis Recipients of PrEP also need to be tested on a minimum of a quarterly basis during to ensure they remain HIV negative do not present with decreased estimated creatinine clearance levels or reductions in BMD The aim of this review is to describe and discuss safety concerns on the use of PrEP in the literature Results from this review will contribute to the growing knowledge on the safety profile or use of PrEP Methods We performed a search of the literature on PrEP in PubMed date May scholar google date May global advocacy for HIV prevention Vaccine Advocacy database date May and the clinical trials http www clinicaltrials gov date May using combination search terms concerns in the use of use as for PrEP and to identify literature on PrEP safety trials and issues The coverage dates were from January to April We limited the search to articles in English which were completed with results available and based on the safety or efficacy of TDF FTC and TDF FTC We profiled our findings on safety concerns of PrEP Information on clinical trials was extracted from PubMed Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and clinicaltrials gov based on completed studies Fig Chart of search strategy for clinical trials on prophylaxis based on tenofovir emtricitabine and a TDF FTC combination AVAC Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition In the clinical trials database studies that were enrolling or incomplete at the time of this review were excluded cases were retrieved We modified the search for closed and completed studies and reduced the number to Further modification with emphasis on the drugs of interest reduced the trials to We then isolated nine studies that were complete with results and enough data for our review In PubMed we obtained articles after the initial search We then limited the search to only clinical trials and obtained We then modified to include only trials involving TDF FTC and TDF and got articles From here we isolated articles that were completed and had results We then focused on efficacy and safety and retrieved nine articles For AVAC the initial search on PrEP and then clinical trials and product development yielded we then selected completed studies and obtained articles We then modified to focus on efficacy and safety and isolated eight articles We then isolated studies that appeared in all three search engines that satisfied our review requirements and used these for our review and discussion Results Clinical Trials Supporting the Use of PrEP Numerous trials involving both humans and animals have tested oral and vaginal routes of administration of PrEP and have been found efficacious in preventing HIV The basis for PrEP stems from results of clinical and epidemiological research We reviewed clinical trials on PrEP among different risk groups conducted from to These trials had results at the time of our study and allowed for review Results from literature on PrEP studies are not necessarily universal The efficacy ranges from lack of protection to protection levels of as high as attesting to the complex nature of PrEP implementation Aside from the effectiveness of PrEP in most of the studies cited the Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic and Preexposure Prophylaxis Trial for HIV Prevention among African Women studies were terminated ahead of time because the analysis failed to demonstrate efficacy attributed to poor adherence Results for the VOICE study differ with findings in three other vaginal PrEP trials PrEP Iniciativa Profilaxis and one vaginal gel trial for AIDS program of Research in South Africa Partners PrEP studied Truvada and TDF alone in committed African couples studied heterosexual African women and men iPrEx studied gay and bisexual men on four continents and CAPRISA studied South African women Poor adherence as in was the main reason for failure in all three VOICE arms Among women who became infected with HIV entered the trial with acute HIV infection With their exclusion HIV incidence was per meaning about in every women got infected in every months HIV incidence rates per were and for oral TDF vs placebo and for Truvada vs placebo and and for TDF gel vs therefore none of the three strategies worked as hazard ratios was for oral TDF HR confidence interval oral Truvada HR CI and TDF gel HR CI In all cases women reported adherence with return data suggesting the same but TDF concentrations in plasma told another story or fewer women in all three treatment arms had detectable concentrations in plasma in oral TDF in oral Truvada and using TDF gel In all three again or more women never had detectable blood in any sample Three factors predicted detectable TDF in plasma first being married odds ratio CI the second being older than years odds ratio CI and the third being multiparous odds ratio CI The study of participants reported new HIV infections months after initiation of the study with the infections equally distributed between Truvada and placebo groups in each clearly indicating the lack of protection in the use of Truvada Overall adherence on participants was with no clear difference in adherence between the two arms These two results revealed that that are long acting and require minimum daily adherence may be more suitable for the population under contrary to positive results posted by the other findings which suggest that young sexually active single people can be motivated to take oral Truvada or TDF gel regularly enough to protect themselves from HIV However the CAPRISA trial differed from the and VOICE studies by determining a protection against HIV at a TDF concentration of ng mL and up to with a TDF concentration of ng mL Results from Prophylaxis to Prevent the Acquisition of Infection in the UK and Intervention Preventive de aux Risques avec Risques avec et pour les Gays in France both showed that PrEP reduced infections among gay men by None of the participants on PrEP involved in these studies acquired HIV PrEP was also found to be effective for heterosexual men and women a study in East Africa reduced possible HIV infection within couples in which one partner was positive by The iPrEx study also found that the HIV infection rate in gay men who were given a daily pill containing Truvada was reduced by compared with men given placebo Those who confirmed adherence at had a reduction rate of up to The trial in Botswana gave a reduction rate of against placebo and after secondary therefore confirming the obvious benefit in the use of PrEP The Bangkok Tenofovir Study focused on men and women who inject drugs and found that the risk of acquiring HIV reduced by and up to in those who adhered consistently to their medication The study also found that participants taking TDF were more likely to experience nausea and or vomiting than those in the placebo group No indication of elevated creatinine or renal impairment in the TDF group was reported The PrEP study in USA with participants with taking TDF and taking placebo was successful with only four on placebo and three among the participants seroconverting Estimated adherence by pill load was and by medication event monitoring system was Oral TDF was well tolerated with no significant renal concerns while adverse drug events reported did not differ significantly between TDF and placebo arms Sensitivity analysis on oral PrEP demonstrated that both TDF FTC and TDF are efficacious in the prevention of HIV infection for a variety of populations irrespective of country Both daily and intermittent dosing of PrEP have proven effective and safe Pharmacokinetic modelling of the prophylaxis initiative data revealed that a PrEP dose regimen of days in the week dosing could achieve as high as efficacy in the prevention of HIV infection among MSM Additionally an intermittent dosing of days in the week could result in efficacy In a laboratory analysis detectable blood concentrations of medications used for PrEP were consistently associated with a protective effect against HIV acquisition Safety Concerns Adverse reactions to medications used for any intervention are undoubtedly a primary safety concern irrespective of the duration of use A qualitative study of gay and bisexual male couples assessed the concerns for adoption of PrEP and revealed that the main concerns and probable barriers to adoption of PrEP were and side effects or adverse effects due to intermittent dosing or early termination of drug use aside from cost and accessibility of the drugs In this review we acknowledge that the trials discussed are short term and do not give the opportunity to assess the safety profile of the products used for PrEP prophylaxis is premised on ARV medications that have been used by people living with HIV and AIDS for quite some time now since the inception of ARVs We would expect based on current evidence that the safety profile will be within acceptable limits with favourable profiles considering the impact of PrEP on HIV prevention Nonetheless established adverse drug events such as renal impairment reduction in BMD and gastrointestinal disturbances captured in scientific literature concerning the use of TDF should be considered and monitoring is recommended in PrEP use An earlier study by the same authors on the association between the occurrence of adverse drug events and the modification of highly active antiretroviral therapy in Ghanaian patients established that adverse drug events play a major role in treatment modification and could be used as a predictor for possible therapy modification Other concerns on the use and implementation of PrEP include resistance to PrEP medications feasibility acceptability and very importantly adherence to PrEP regimens Because of the importance of PrEP in reducing the spread of HIV it is critical that these concerns are addressed and fears alleviated to allow for the promising potential of PrEP The US Public Health Service recommended guidelines for the use of PrEP in and the CDC has interim guidelines for clinicians on the use of PrEP Essential factors to be considered before using PrEP include a confirmed status with a normal renal function and a negative hepatitis B status Recipients of PrEP should be at high risk for HIV infection receive behavioural and adherence counselling and need to be tested on a minimum of a quarterly basis during to ensure they remain HIV negative Adverse Effects The TDF FTC combination or TDF alone used for PrEP generally shows a tolerable profile In most studies the experienced side effects did not differ significantly from rates among participants taking placebo The side effects or adverse events are basically of GIT origin and more prevalent at the start of use but subside within a month of use The GIT disturbances are generally upset abdominal pain nausea vomiting or diarrhoea Other reported adverses events not of GIT origin are dizziness headache fatigue weight loss shortness of breath cough anxiety fever or joint and muscle pain In most studies these side effects or adverse events did not differ significantly from rates among participants taking placebo Risk factors in use include age duration of treatment with TDF elevated baseline creatinine levels and treatment with a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir combinations and among persons with African descent as against Caucasians Side effects considered potentially serious in the daily use of Truvada or TDF for PrEP are liver function problems kidney damage hypophosphatamia proteinaemia or glucosuria pancreatitis bone thinning and lactic acidosis symptoms hypertriglyceridemia increased creatinine phosphokinase unusual dreams and hyperpigmentation are associated with the use of FTC The Partners PrEP safety trial the iPrEx and the Bangkok Tenofovir studies all recorded increased serum creatinine levels but analyses indicated that they were statistically insignificant compared with placebo However changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate were associated with a small but statistically significant decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate which was and resolved with TDF discontinuation The use of TDF alone is also associated with liver and pancreatic problems as well as depression The iPrEx study found a modest effect on BMD reduction in men who participated in the study The study compared changes in BMD between placebo group and study participants with blood concentrations of tenofovir diphosphate associated with efficacy and use of two to three tablets per week There was a decline of in the hip and in the spine by the end of the study in those with optimal TDF diphosphate concentrations but this reduced to normal levels after years of stopping PrEP The loss of BMD could lead to potential bone fractures and is a problem for PrEP This could be because of phosphate wasting TDF FTC was well tolerated with some nausea but little difference was observed between participants and those taking placebo vs No differences in severe or adverse laboratory events were observed between the active and placebo groups In the CAPRISA study hepatic flare as an event with an abrupt rise of alanine aminotransferase levels to more than five times the upper limit of during chronic hepatitis B virus infection and considered to be the result of a human leukocyte restricted cytotoxic T immune response against hepatitis B virus was observed for two hepatitis B carriers but this did not result in drug discontinuation In the study there were no significant differences across the study arms with respect to serious adverse effects including the total of deaths per arm The US MSM safety trial presented no marked difference in the overall frequency of adverse events between TDF and placebo groups but in a subset of men at a San Francisco site n the use of TDF was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in BMD at the femoral neck and total hip but no bone fractures were detected Rates of nausea and vomiting were higher among the TDF than among placebo recipients in the first months in the Bangkok Tenofovir Study but not thereafter The rates of adverse drug events deaths or elevated creatinine were not different between the TDF and the placebo groups Concerning the trials with questionable efficacy the trial presented adverse drug events of nausea and vomiting which were transient and a mild elevation of liver enzymes was much more common with the TDF FTC group than that of placebo group No change in renal function was reported in either group In the VOICE study a confirmed increase in creatinine levels was observed in the oral TDF FTC group than in the oral placebo group There were no significant differences between the active products and placebo groups for other safety outcomes Resistance Generally resistance to PrEP is rarely observed in seroconverters who are infected with HIV after randomisation Participants who show resistance are more likely to be the result of circulating resistance and not necessarily PrEP induced In the PROUD trial no one acquired resistance to TDF Resistant virus reported in studies include one with virus in a participant randomised to TDF and one with virus in a participant randomised to FTC TDF from the trial They were found to be infected at randomisation A rare TDF resistance mutation was however reported in the TDF arm of the study after randomisation In the study and resistance mutations occurred in one participant in the TDF FTC group The participant was later found to have had HIV infection at enrolment The iPrEx study presented two of two men in the active group and one of eight in the placebo group with virus TDF FTC resistant virus was detected in five women in the placebo group and four in the TDF FTC in the study Two women from the TDF FTC group who were determined after enrolment to have had acute HIV infection at baseline had the virus with the V mutation associated with FTC resistance One other woman also had the V mutation but acquired the HIV infection after enrolment The development of a resistant mutation seems to be more common with FTC than TDF Additional care must be deployed to ensure that PrEP use is not approved during the acute infection stage to prevent the development of resistance strains An abstract authored by Knox et al presented at the CROI conference in Boston MA USA titled infection with multiclass resistance despite provided evidence of breakthrough HIV infection irrespective of adherence to FTC TDF via clinical and pharmacokinetic and described a resistant strain irrespective of adherence It is described as the first such report and more efforts would be deployed to closely monitor the use of PrEP following this report The other area of concern is sexual and reproductive health because women of childbearing age are prone to HIV infection and the use of PrEP in discordant relationships could be useful The Partners PrEP and the studies showed that TDF based PrEP does not affect the effectiveness of hormonal contraception and neither does hormonal contraception affect PrEP efficacy There were not significant differences in pregnancy related and infant adverse reaction including premature births congenital anomalies and growth throughout the early years of life for infants born to women who received PrEP as against placebo in the Partners PrEP study Therefore PrEP is relatively safe to be used by women of age though like all medicines its benefits should be weighed against any risks that it may pose in specific individuals Feasibility and Acceptability Some research on behavioural tendencies has helped to determine adherence to PrEP but few studies have assessed the acceptability and use of PrEP Factors associated with intentions to use PrEP in a sample of men who have sex with men in USA included the efficacy costs and potential side effects of PrEP Preliminary findings from the PrEP Safety trial showed that MSM attending the STD clinic in San Francisco had a high interest in taking PrEP This trial also demonstrated feasibility of including PrEP in busy clinical settings indicating that PrEP can be accessed at clinics providing HIV care management Project PrEP a study on the acceptability and feasibility of PrEP among young men who have sex with men reported of high feasibility and acceptability of PrEP The PROUD study also affirmed the feasibility of incorporating PrEP in routine activities of clinical settings Acceptability of PrEP as demonstrated in a study among MSM and female sex workers in Nairobi and Mtwapa Kenya was also rated as high Suggestions proposed in this study included how best to improve the pill characteristics to make it easy to take how to reduce stigma and discrimination from other family members certain barriers and facilitators to adhering to PrEP regimens such as lifestyles dosing regimen and side effects were identified Enhanced counselling and commitment to using the products also improved their ability to adhere to the regimens despite the challenges Participants in all the listed studies were receptive to monthly HIV testing and counselling risk reduction counselling physical examinations and intervention sessions Participants were more likely to accept a daily pill compared with multiple daily pills administration especially if they knew their partner was not infected The Ipergay trial demonstrated that MSM who do not use condoms consistently accepted on demand PrEP as a practical alternative to daily PrEP if its effective A substudy of The Alternative Dosing to Augment Prophylaxis Pill Taking study involving men in Harlem revealed scepticism and distrust by male partners and sometimes resulted in unwillingness of partners to engage in sex after learning about their PrEP use thus pointing out how stigma and social barriers may impede adherence and therefore acceptability Adherence Six clinical trials yielded PrEP efficacy estimates of mostly because of differences in adherence among the studies adherence to PrEP is unreliable as the initial clinical trials quickly established that blood drug concentrations sharply differ from perceived adherence claims Effective counselling and other support measures are required in all persons who desire to use PrEP for HIV prevention The iPrEx study clearly illustrated how adherence produced different outcomes in gay men who were given a daily pill of TDF and FDC and achieved a reduction rate of as against men given a placebo It was realised that subjects who by and pill count took the drugs more than of the time reduced the infection rate by Meanwhile another interesting finding of the trial indicated that while of trial subjects reported complete compliance only actually complied effectively when drug concentrations in blood were determined The investigators concluded through calculations that a reduction in the risk of HIV infection could have been as much as compared with placebo if the study subjects had complied totally This confirms the importance of adherence as a major tool to be deployed in PrEP The trial which was halted for futility reported adherence by and pill count as high but plasma drug concentrations showed that only of samples from HIV seroconverters had detectable concentrations of serum TDF and only of controls This low level of adherence was recorded as by the researchers and this may have resulted in the inability to assess the protective effect of Truvada in trial This again points to the importance of ensuring adherence

Their multivariable analyses showed that age and sex were likely associated with adherence In this study men having sex with other men were surveyed of participants indicated regular taking of medicines of this number reported taking medicines for treatment whilst said they take medicines for preventive purposes The study also realised that men aged older than years were more likely to report excellent adherence together with those who did not report any adherence barriers Willingness to use PrEP was also associated with high likelihood of reporting perfect adherence They listed factors that improved medication adherence as establishing a routine keeping medication visible and using a Forgetfulness changes in usual routine and being busy or away from home were listed as barriers to adherence Counselling strategies to build routines can help improve adherence to PrEP Daily dosing are much more associated with a high level of adherence than use of PrEP which is generally low Following the approval of the use of PrEP in USA and Europe reports on adherence have been claimed to be higher in recent trials and open label extensions as compared with the initial clinical trials Explanations provided include available evidence of PrEP efficacy and individual motivations and reasons for taking PrEP Discussion The advent of PrEP is a promising turning point in the prevention of HIV among groups PrEP is recommended to prevent HIV infection in tandem with other preventive measures From the trials reviewed it is evident that PrEP is highly effective against HIV infection when taken as required Most importantly PrEP seems to be characterised by low adverse effects Our current review shows a favourable pattern of adverse events for PrEP among eligible populations Side effects can lead to a lack of compliance resulting in low levels of adherence of medicine to pill use Some reported symptoms associated with the start of PrEP gradually resolve Generally even for some side effects listed as serious such as kidney dysfunction observed increases in the serum creatinine level return to normal after the discontinuation of PrEP Tubular renal toxicity from PrEP is rare and active screening is not recommended The same applies to the reduction of BMD after cessation in the use of TDF and therefore current evidence does not support constant monitoring at baseline before initiating PrEP and while taking TDF FTC Liver toxicity mentioned earlier in the findings was reported by the D A D study which looked at the use of antiretroviral therapy and the risk of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in persons It concluded among that alongside other antiretroviral agents TDF is associated with an increased risk of liver disease among patients on therapy It also indicated that the unexpected viral hepatitis independent TDF association should be investigated further The use of PrEP is yet to present any case report involving serious hepatic complications However the regular monitoring of liver enzymes in PrEP uses would be helpful in preventing possible toxicities The correspondent decrease in sexual risk behaviour among participants in the course of PrEP is very encouraging This is attributed to behavioural intervention including sexual health counselling and the provision of condoms across the studies where applicable Undoubtedly behavioural interventions should be an integral part of PrEP Because PrEP is meant for individuals an important aspect of PrEP is the identification of people who are seroconverting Preliminary testing methods for example polymerase chain reaction that can diagnose people who are recently infected with HIV are thus important but expensive This will enable provision of treatment options instead of preventive interventions Exclusion criteria that run across trials were the low level of creatinine clearance below mL min some cases of hepatitis and evidence of bone fractures People who do not qualify for PrEP but are at risk for HIV should be encouraged to adhere to good sexual behavioural prevention practices including regular condom use The reduction in rates of sex without condoms from to after months of the trial is encouraging and shows that counselling and education on good sexual practices is complementary on HIV prevention Several other studies including studies conducted in West African women with TDF also demonstrate a reduction in sexual behaviour with counselling during PrEP TDF FTC is the only medication with a label indication as PrEP against HIV infection but new PrEP drugs and formulations are being considered for future trials intravaginal rings containing dapivirine and and injectables These newer agents also present a good safety profile when used for the treatment of HIV infection but use for PrEP purposes in persons is unknown as efficacy and clinical safety is yet to be established A new formulation tenofovir alafenamide that provides lower plasma levels of TDF concentrations compared with standard TDF has recently being approved by the FDA It is claimed to have favourable renal and bone safety profile better than original TDF unfortunately as at the time of this review efficacy and safety in PrEP has not been established in populations Conclusion The medications currently studied for PrEP and are efficacious and seem to have a good safety profile within the average short period of years studied Emphasis on the use of additional prevention methods should be made alongside The main adverse effects observed with PrEP are GI related and graded below for severity These are basically mild to moderate nausea vomiting and diarrhea Major concerns are renal hepatic and bone toxicity but these are transient and and quickly resolved after discontinuation of TDF Overall the profiles of the products used for PrEP appear favourable PrEP as an intervention to reduce HIV transmission appears to have a safe profile in clinical trials It is recommended for widespread use but adherence monitoring and safety surveillance are critical in the phase to ensure that the benefits observed in clinical trials are maintained in use Behavioural counselling and assurance of safety and efficacy are important components of PrEP Other factors of PrEP implementation that have been suggested include improving access averting stigma cost effectiveness and education on PrEP to improve knowledge and assure people of the efficacy profile of products used for PrEP Further studies must ultimately look at how safe and beneficial PrEP could be for pregnant women and women seeking to get pregnant contributions The authors RAT ANOD BAY and ETN worked on the conception study design and the final article

on the unexplored phenomenon of multiple institutional affiliations using scientific publications Institutional affiliations are important in the organisation and governance of science Multiple affiliations may alter the traditional framework of academic employment and careers and may require a reappraisal of institutional assessment based on research outcomes of affiliated staff Results for authors in three major science and technology nations Japan and the and in three fields chemistry and show that multiple affiliations have at least doubled over the past few years The analysis proposes three major types of multiple affiliations that depend on the structure of the research sector and its international openness Highly internationalised and higher affiliations are most common for researchers in the UK whereas Germany and Japan have stronger affiliation patterns International multiple affiliations are however still more common in Germany compared to Japan which is characterised by a domestic affiliation distribution Moreover multiple affiliation authors are more often found on high impact papers particularly in the case of authors from Japan and Germany in the

Cornelia Budapest Hungary Introduction Recent literature has emphasised the importance of as well as collaborations for academic research which has been documented by the increase in team sizes and collaborations on papers et al Wuchty et al Jones et al In this academic environment that promotes collaboration and mobility et al multiple affiliations are increasingly recognised as facilitating knowledge exchange and have been said to become more widespread and Musselin Nonetheless to date there has been little systematic assessment of the extent and patterns of these multiple affiliations primarily due to the lack of sufficient bibliometric data which would allow for determining such links and Martin There are several factors that may contribute to multiple affiliations Individual scientists may seek affiliations to gain access to additional research resources or networks as affiliation to an institution is closely linked to resource access research infrastructure and career opportunities Long and McGuinnis Fox Stephan but may also be motivated by personal financial benefits While can be an effective way of expanding a research competencies may constitute a way of forming stronger ties between researchers and institutions Lander for instance found some evidence that in the case of infection and immunity researchers in Canada multiple affiliations facilitate may also reduce the burden of using an research infrastructure compared to collaboration through alone Furthermore researchers may seek additional affiliations to increase the visibility and geographic reach of their work especially if they are placed in more peripheral regions or institutions On the institutional side performance assessments have led universities across the globe to become more proactive in attracting the most prolific researchers in a bid to enhance their position in national and international rankings Offering the option of additional affiliations to the most able researchers in a field may provide institutions with access to researchers For example universities in China and Saudi Arabia created special positions to attract leading foreign scholars to enhance their prestige and ranking which saw an increase in papers from both countries but with science that did not always originate there and Normile Bhattacharjee Affiliations are also offered by past employers in an effort to maintain links with alumni employees and may therefore constitute a direct consequence of increased mobility Public and private sector research centres moreover offer affiliations in order to foster mobility and facilitate research collaborations and knowledge exchange with the academic sector The drivers as resource access personal finances or institutional and implications as collaboration or research of multiple affiliations likely differ by the type of affiliation under consideration as well as by the institutional contexts in which these affiliations form Thus for any assessment of their potential implications one first requires a better understanding of the forms that multiple affiliations take and how they differ between disciplines and countries with distinct science governance structures Addressing the current lack of evidence regarding multiple affiliations this study proposes an analysis of institutional affiliations based on scientific publications that makes use of a new tag available in Web of Science since The new tag allows us to unambiguously link authors to their institutions and to determine whether an author has multiple affiliations We then analyse the types of multiple affiliations in terms of and affiliations Further incorporating citation data we investigate the link between multiple affiliations and publication impact Looking at authors in Germany Japan and the UK straddling three major science and technology and in three fields chemistry and our results demonstrate that multiple affiliations have increased over the past few years Yet the types of multiple affiliations depend on the structure of the research sector and its international openness While this analysis can only provide a first look at the extent and structure of multiple affiliations we anticipate the findings will encourage more research into their contractual and organisational nature We also hope to spur discussion regarding academic employment and affiliations that no longer require the commitment of academics with implications for institutional assessment based on research outcomes of affiliated and the funding of academic research both nationally and internationally Data and methods The data used in this study are pairs retrieved from Web of Science First we select a set of journals based on the journal citation report Thomson in three fields bioscience chemistry and engineering Journals listed in the JCR are sorted by eigenfactor score a rating of journal importance based on the number of incoming citations that enables us to consider journals across all quality spectra The bottom of the eigenfactor distribution is discarded as they represent primarily national journals of little importance within the field The remaining journals are split into four quartiles of the eigenfactor distribution for each scientific field and five journals are randomly drawn from each quartile thus obtaining three samples of journals by field stratified by eigenfactor score For each journal we check on a subsample of articles whether addresses are correctly listed and we drop and replace journals with any address inconsistencies Documents published in each of the selected journals and with an address in one of the three selected countries Japan and the are downloaded from WoS for the years The retrieval relies on author addresses as listed in WoS Overall we consider records of bioscience articles chemistry articles and engineering articles Each author on the selected publications is attributed one or more institution based on the author address field in WoS The field provides address information separately for each author and lists more than one address per author where this occurs We split each publication record by author and address to build a table with lines These records are checked for any address inconsistencies i e whether address information is missing for one or more authors Publications that do not report addresses for all their authors are excluded The number of excluded publications is or of all publications Only authors with at least one address in Germany Japan or the UK are retained In total we identify authors with an address in Germany with an address in Japan and with an address in the UK It is important to note that this study does not attempt to disambiguate author names and the same author can appear in the data multiple times As the goal is to provide an application of the field for measuring multiple affiliations and to gain first insights and identify general trends no author disambiguation was performed However results are robust to the deletion of all repeated names within one subject area and year or to the deletion of all duplicate names in general All addresses appearing in the data are coded by institution type and country In doing so each institution is assigned a unique code to ensure that multiple addresses are truly different and to exclude multiple affiliations the same institution The coding was undertaken meaning that a search algorithm first identified address entries containing word elements such as and marked these as universities All entries were then checked manually and organisation names searched online to assign institution types We not only coded institutions in the three countries of interest but also institutions in other countries if an author had a secondary affiliation there In total we identified different institutions These institutions were coded as belonging to the higher education sector public or research institutes research institutes private sector institutions government or other institutions as industry Each institution was moreover assigned a country code The maximum number of affiliations at truly different institutions observed for one author is seven while the maximum number of different institution types is three In addition the number of citations received up to March is collected for all articles in the sample to measure the impact of multiple affiliations This means that we have different citation windows depending on the year of publication As the citation count is highly field and year sensitive we follow Lee et al and consider papers that are in the top of citations in their field in each year of March as papers with high scientific impact This alternative measure corrects for any year or subject bias of the pure citation count Only authors in our sample appear on articles that are in the top we therefore also consider the top as an alternative measure This method of determining impact may be preferable to pure citation counts as it is less sensitive to year and field differences Results Trends in multiple affiliations Table shows the total number of authors reported on the selected publications by country and field as well as the number and proportion of authors that report more than one institutional address Of the more than authors in the sample have more than one institution attached with some differences across countries and subject areas The proportion of authors with multiple institutional addresses is highest with more than of authors in biology and chemistry in the case of Germany and biology in the case of the UK This already suggests some country and differences regarding the extent of multiple affiliations Table Number of authors by field and number of authors with addresses in multiple institutions on pairs for the years Country Subject No of authors No of authors with multiple affiliation Proportion Japan Biology Chemistry Engineering Germany Biology Chemistry Engineering UK Biology Chemistry Engineering Total pairings are available from onwards which means that we can also observe whether there is a trend towards more institutional affiliations since then Figure shows how the share of authors with more than one affiliation address evolved over the period We see an upward trend in multiple affiliations in all scientific fields and countries from about in to in For Japanese authors in bioscience however this increase only happened after and multiple affiliations are still lower than for bioscience authors in Germany and the UK Fig Share of authors with multiple affiliations by country and field Note Colour scheme from Bischof These results of a significant and growing proportion of authors with multiple affiliations also corroborate the increasing importance of studying multiple affiliations in the context of scientific research Main affiliations in the three countries The research structure differs between the three countries and subject areas and these differences are reflected in the types of institutions that publish academic research Table reports the different forms of institutional affiliations within the three countries for all authors For this purpose all multiple affiliations outside the focus country are excluded and only affiliations within each of the three countries considered We observe that most authors have their address within a HEI This share is highest for authors in the UK where of authors have at least one address within a HEI The share of authors with an address in a HEI is lowest in Germany and especially in engineering where only of authors are affiliated with a HEI Outside the higher education sector authors are primarily affiliated to PROs In Germany PROs account for of all author addresses which has its root in a large public research sector in Germany In Japan PROs account for and in the UK for just of all authors NGOs are an important affiliation only amongst bioscience authors in the UK through institutions such as the Wellcome Trust Here they account for almost of authors Private sector authors are found mostly in engineering in Germany and Japan with more than of authors and in bioscience in Japan with In the UK they account for just of authors Government appears as a frequent affiliation amongst engineering and chemistry authors in Germany and the UK with of authors Table Author affiliations the three countries of all Country Discipline HEI PRO NGO Private Government Other Japan Bioscience Chemistry Engineering Germany Bioscience Chemistry Engineering UK Bioscience Chemistry Engineering Row sums are larger than as authors can belong to more than one institution type Only addresses within the three countries are considered Both single and multiple affiliation authors are considered The address breakdown by country and sector reflects the research activities of the various sectors in the three countries as well as the research structure Higher publication participation amongst private sector authors in Japan and Germany compared to the UK suggests that more commonality between sectors and opportunities for joint research may exist there which may also be conducive to multiple affiliations and international affiliations Multiple affiliations can occur across all sectors Figure reports the share of authors with two or more HEI affiliations and HEI and selected affiliations over all multiple affiliations by countries and fields including affiliations with institutions abroad Only the most common combinations are reported Amongst UK authors more than with multiple affiliations have a affiliation i e belong to two or more HEI regardless of academic field For authors with at least one address in Germany or Japan this share is much lower at fewer than of multiple afilliation authors Instead affiliations especially with PROs are more often observed This is reflective of the stronger public research sectors in the two countries which also seems to extend into joint appointments For UK authors with the charity research sector are of importance in the biosciences The share of authors with joint HEI and private sector affiliations is highest in engineering and for authors in Japan that is in those areas where private sector publications are more often found Multiple affiliations with other sectors such as national and local government agencies are less often found Also that do not include at least one university are rarely observed Only of authors with multiple affiliations do not concern HEI authors Fig affiliations as share of authors with multiple affiliations by country and field Note Bar sums can be larger than as authors can belong to more than two institution types Colour scheme from Bischof Additional affiliations can not only be in a different sector but also with an institution abroad We propose to plot affiliations along their international and dimensions to quantify the difference in between countries and fields We do this by plotting the share of multiple affiliation authors with a affiliation on the x and the share of multiple affiliation authors with an international affiliation on the y for each country and field combination Figure shows that affiliations are more common amongst authors with at least one address in Japan or Germany as already seen in Fig For authors with an address in Japan the domestic nature of multiple affiliations is particularly strong while authors in Germany show slightly higher levels of internationalisation with of multiple affiliations involving an institution abroad Authors with at least one address in the UK on the other hand are characterised by little but high international This means that authors in the UK primarily with HEIs abroad The graphical representation in Fig thus shows that in this analysis we can observe three classes of multiple affiliations a highly internationalised affiliation distribution as represented by authors in the UK a balanced affiliation distribution as seen in Germany and a domestic affiliation distribution as seen in Japan Fig and international as share of authors with multiple affiliations by country and field Impact and multiple affiliations Previous literature has linked collaboration to higher research quality and impact in terms of citations and Hicks Wuchty et al Using publication level information regarding citations received up to March we can investigate whether multiple affiliations too are associated with higher impact publications One may expect a correlation between author numbers and multiple affiliations and numbers thus to act as confounding factor however there is no significant correlation between the two vs authors p with the exception of chemistry in Japan and Germany Table reports the differences in the number of citations and the share of papers between those with and without multiple affiliations It shows that in the case of Japan authors with multiple affiliations have higher citation numbers and are more often found on top impact publications in bioscience and chemistry In the case of Germany only bioscience publications with multiple affiliation authors have statistically significantly more citations or top impact articles than those with single affiliation status Finally UK authors with multiple affiliations do not receive more citations or have more top articles They do however still publish more articles in the top in bioscience and engineering but not chemistry These correlations suggest that for UK authors their primarily international affiliations are less associated with higher article impact Bioscience and chemistry authors in Japan on the other hand show higher publication impact that may be due to their links with PROs but may also represent funding relationships Table Citation impact of authors with single versus multiple affiliations Discipline Country Citation numbers Top Top t test test test Japan Bioscience Chemistry Engineering Germany Bioscience Chemistry Engineering UK Bioscience Chemistry Engineering indicate significance levels of using a t or a test Significance levels remain in ANOVAs that control for author counts Conclusion This paper studied multiple affiliations of authors in research publications Results for three scientific fields chemistry and and three countries Japan and the showed that multiple affiliations are widespread and have increased in all fields and countries during the period We found that multiple affiliations reflect the dynamics of the research sector in specific countries and proposed a classification of the and international dimension of author affiliations To summarise we find three types of multiple affiliations that can be classified as a highly internationalised HEI centred affiliation distribution as represented by researchers in the UK a balanced affiliation distribution as seen in Germany and a domestic affiliation distribution as seen in Japan These results suggest that affiliations are highest in countries and fields with a large research sector while affiliations are highest in countries with an international research base An analysis of other countries may find additional types However the occurrence of low affiliations paired with low internationalisation that is where academic authors are primarily affiliated with other domestic universities may be limited by academic employment contracts which generally still limit such arrangements These observed differences have consequences for the types of networking that can be achieved through multiple affiliations in different countries For example international affiliations may help to preserve links to research institutions while affiliations may be more conducive to knowledge transfer and mobility between sectors Our results did however show that most multiple affiliations of academics are with other universities or with PROs including in the cases of Japan and Germany The role of multiple affiliations as a facilitator for knowledge transfer between distinct sectors may therefore be rather limited We also find some evidence that multiple affiliation authors are more often found on high impact papers This complements existing findings of a positive correlation between collaboration and citations and Hicks Wuchty et al Regardless of author team size citation numbers are higher for authors with multiple affiliations in the biosciences and chemistry in Japan and Germany In the UK however we only find smaller correlations Resource access considerations may thus be the driver for multiple affiliations in Germany and Japan while in the UK this may not be the case as they may simply have less to gain from additional affiliation due to their already higher citation numbers Nevertheless several limitations apply For example this analysis does not determine whether the association between citations and affiliations found in Japan and Germany is driven by the affiliation itself through access to human or other resources or whether perhaps more able academics are more likely to engage in additional affiliations To investigate these causal relationships more information on individual authors is required Moreover it is not clear how well publication data can capture multiple affiliations While institutions may encourage researchers to list them this may be dependent on the rewards offered Authors may also take strategic decisions regarding the affiliations they list depending on the journal or the type of research undertaken A longitudinal study of authors is therefore encouraged to uncover choices regarding institution address selection It is further not clear from publication data what the nature of multiple affiliations is i e whether they are due to second appointments visiting periods research funding or other types of arrangements We also cannot be certain about an home institution when multiple addresses are listed This may affect the interpretation of some of the findings as foreign university researchers could be affiliating with PROs private sector institutions or others in one of the three countries in this analysis Publications may also not represent the preferred dissemination method for academic authors that are also affiliated with the private or government sector These may rely on alternative dissemination channels such as reports and thus not be captured through publications in top field journals Regardless our results document multiple affiliations as another factor in the international and collaboration of academic research as well as its correlation with high impact research These insights thus contribute to the discussion about increases in team sizes and collaborations on papers et al Wuchty et al Jones et al The findings also have direct implications for research policy On the one hand there are multiple affiliations that work as a reallocation mechanism between institutions which may benefit resource use efficiency knowledge exchange and collaboration and should therefore be encouraged On the other hand there are or affiliations which could give rise to institutions that act purely as a for researchers with little or no actual research undertaken there Such affiliations can distort institutional performance measures and rankings and have ethical implications due to a lack of research contribution from the additional institution et al Multiple affiliations may also reflect may be a symptom a decline of institutional support for academics especially regarding resource constraints in research or the casualisation of the academic profession which require academics to seek resources and work roles outside their main institution We therefore encourage more research into multiple affiliations in other country and field contexts and are confident that our analysis will encourage a discourse regarding their scientific and institutional impact This tag has previously been used by Lander to determine multiple affiliations amongst infection and immunity researchers in Vancouver Canada Coding of institution types in Japan additionally made use of WoS address dictionaries provided by the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy http www nistep go jp In the case of Japan this denotes national regional and private in Germany it includes universities technical universities and universities of applied sciences Hospitals were assigned to one of the institution types depending on their organisational structure The majority were university teaching hospitals and thus assigned to HEI The shares are higher at if we consider multiple affiliations within the same institution However such multiple affiliations are not the focus of this analysis This share is higher than previous research by Katz and Hicks suggested The difference may be due to changes in the UK public research sector organisation where many previously independent research council laboratories and hospitals have experienced a closer integration with universities Acknowledgements We are grateful for

indicate if changes were made Introduction Antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed drug class in children data mining on the paediatric population showed potential associations between antibiotic use and acute liver injury Objective We assessed risk estimates of liver injury associated with antibiotic use in children and adolescent outpatients Methods A large study was performed in people years of age from two European countries and The during the period All potential cases of liver injury were automatically extracted from three databases and then manually validated based on Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences criteria and by exclusion of all competing causes for liver injury Up to control participants were sampled for each case and were matched on index date of the event age sex and database Based on prescription data antibiotic exposure was categorized as current recent or past use by calculating the time period between the end of prescription and the index date Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were applied to calculate odds ratios as a measure of the association confidence interval Results We identified cases of liver injury and matched to controls Current use of overall antibiotics is associated with a threefold increased risk of liver injury compared with past use OR adj CI With regard to individual antibiotics the risk is significantly increased for current use of each antibiotic p except for azithromycin Risk estimates vary from the lowest OR adj of CI for amoxicillin to the highest OR adj of CI for cotrimoxazole e sulphamethoxazole and CI for ceftriaxone Sensitivity analyses confirm the associations for ceftriaxone cotrimoxazole and clarithromycin Conclusion liver injury in children is heterogeneous across the use of individual antibiotics When prescribing ceftriaxone cotrimoxazole and clarithromycin in children paediatricians should definitely be aware of their potential risk of liver injury even if for short periods Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users Springer International Publishing Switzerland Key Points Compared with past use current use of antibiotics in children was associated with an increase in the risk for liver injury Substantial differences in risk estimates have been found among individual antibiotics Paediatricians should be aware of the potential increase of liver enzymes in children taking ceftriaxone sulphamethoxazole trimethoprim combination or clarithromycin even for short periods Introduction Antibiotics are the most common drug class causing liver injury in the general population hepatotoxic reactions are usually idiosyncratic unpredictable and present a poorly understood pathogenesis The diagnosis of liver injury is challenging due to heterogeneous clinical manifestations ranging from transient mild asymptomatic liver function abnormalities to rare potentially fatal acute liver failure Moreover especially for antibiotics causality assessment is difficult because the indication for antibiotic treatment acts as confounder In fact it is known that bacterial infection may lead to changes in hepatic enzymes representing an underlying cause of liver injury per se The diagnosis of liver injury is even more of a challenge in the paediatric setting because of the maturation of the cytochrome enzymes involved in the antibiotic overall metabolism Although several case reports in paediatrics suggest that liver injury in children would be likely at least as in the general population only a few studies addressed this issue specifically in paediatrics Moreover spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting systems showed that antibiotics are most frequently implicated in hepatic ADRs in children and adolescents However since these data lack denominator findings from spontaneous reports may also be explained by the widespread use of these drugs in the paediatric population Moreover a previous study investigating the power of data mining on electronic healthcare databases to assess hepatic drug safety in paediatric outpatients showed that antibiotics had the highest risk of acute liver injury compared with of any drug and relative risks confidence interval for CI for amoxicillin clavulanic and CI for However confounding by indication and protopathic bias could not be fully excluded Given that antibiotics are more commonly prescribed in children than in adults and since no studies have so far examined liver injury specifically in the paediatric population we conducted a large study to investigate the risk estimates of liver injury associated with individual antibiotics in children and adolescent outpatients Methods Source Population We selected all children and adolescents younger than years of age from three longitudinal electronic primary care databases in two European countries Pedianet a family paediatrician Health Longitudinal Patient Database a general practice registry from and the Integrated Primary Care Information a GP database from The Netherlands All three databases contain anonymous data on patient demographics reasons for clinic visits medical diagnoses by GP FP and specialist hospitalizations drug prescriptions and laboratory and other diagnostic findings In The Netherlands the paediatric population receives medical care from GPs while in Italy medical care is provided by FPs to years of and GPs years of These databases are representative of the Italian and Dutch paediatric populations and have been proven to be valid data sources for pharmacoepidemiological studies The study period ran from January to December Case and Control Selection From this population we excluded all children with clear competing causes of liver injury including viral infections hepatic neoplasm autoimmune hepatitis neonatal jaundice genetic hepatopathy biliary tract diseases and abdominal trauma Details on case definition identification and validation have been previously described In brief by applying a similar stepwise approach across all three databases all potential cases were extracted using International Classification of Primary Care codes used in the IPCI or International Classification of Diseases Revision Clinical Modification codes used in the Pedianet and HSD for hepatic reactions signs e hepatitis liver failure hepatic steatosis hepatic cirrhosis hepatic necrosis hepatomegaly or specific keywords for and laboratory values of liver function tests e alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase and total For each potential case the complete electronic medical record history results of laboratory data ultrasound and other diagnostic tests as well as hospital discharge summaries and was then manually validated by four medically trained investigators blinded to the drug exposure Based on Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences criteria and in accordance with previously published evidence cases of liver injury were defined as any increase of more than two times the upper limit of normal range for liver function tests i e ALT AST AP or total bilirubin or their or diagnosis of liver injury confirmed by either a specialist GP or FP or via ultrasound evidence Specific search terms such as jaundice and hepatomegaly which are suggestive of liver injury but are not sufficient by themselves to confirm a diagnosis of livery injury were considered only in association with other more specific symptoms signs g abnormal liver enzyme values Children with elevation of biochemical liver tests e ALT AST or less than two times the ULN or with isolated increases of were excluded as cases In case of uncertainty cases were reviewed by expert medical doctors with the aim of reaching consensus on whether the case was indeed indicative of liver injury The index date of the event was defined as the earliest date of the hepatic symptoms signs e fatigue weakness anorexia nausea jaundice dark urine light stools itching and or in the absence of these the date of abnormal liver tests immediately preceding the diagnosis Within the same underlying study population we selected up to control participants for each case at the same index date through incidence density sampling according to which the likelihood of being selected as a control is proportional to the Controls were matched to the corresponding case on index date year of birth sex and database Exposure Definition Antibiotic exposure Therapeutic Chemical code was evaluated based on prescription data from these healthcare databases To estimate the association between antibiotic use and liver injury we created exposure categories based on timing and duration of use Exposure was categorized as current if the index date fell during antibiotic exposure or within days

prescription before the index date Patient Comorbidities Several comorbidities were addressed as potential risk factors for liver injury Patient medical histories were screened for diagnoses of

drugs for disorders anticonvulsants drugs for respiratory disorders paracetamol and its combinations nervous system drugs as psycholeptics and drugs or immunosuppressants Main Analyses We compared characteristics of cases and controls using conditional logistic regression Covariates associated with liver injury in the univariate analysis at a value and those that changed the point estimate of the association between antibiotics and liver injury by more than were included in the final adjusted model To minimize the effect of confounding by indication past use of any antibiotic served as the reference category instead of of antibiotics Children who have never been treated with antibiotics during the study period may be healthier than those receiving antibiotics and ultimately this may result in an overestimation of the risk of liver injury for all antibiotic users Several multivariate models have been run as primary analyses to estimate the odds ratios together with CIs as a measure of the association between liver injury and current use of antibiotics grouped as follows antibiotics antibiotics by individual antibiotics Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses To rule out possible effects of outcome misclassification we repeated all the analyses in a dataset restricted to patients for which liver injury was strictly defined as more than twice higher than the ULN of laboratory parameters and confirmed by specialists To better address confounding by indication due to current infections a sensitivity analysis was conducted using current use of amoxicillin as a reference group Amoxicillin was chosen since it is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in children and is considered to be when used as a single ingredient compared with its combination with clavulanic acid To investigate exposure misclassification we changed the risk window from days to days e no carryover period at In order to explore the impact of age as an effect modifier we stratified the analysis by age category All analyses were conducted using SPSS version Corporation Armonk NY We used a p value of as the threshold of statistical significance except for the selection

antibiotics and liver injury definite liver injury by more than as concomitant use of c Withdrawn from the Italian market in When restricted to only cases of abnormal liver parameters confirmed by a specialist the associations between current use of antibiotics and liver injury did not change substantially In terms of individual antibiotics the increased risk was confirmed for amoxicillin clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone and became stronger for cefixime and clarithromycin This analysis was limited by statistical power given the few cases exposed to cefaclor ceftibuten and cotrimoxazole The analyses were not stratified by age category because of the very low number of exposed cases among each age subgroup Discussion In this study we found that current use of antibiotics in children and adolescents was associated with a threefold increased risk of liver injury when compared with past use Risk estimates differed among antibiotic classes and varied even more among individual antibiotics belonging to the same subclass Although these associations may be partly explained by confounding due to current infections the use of cotrimoxazole ceftriaxone and clarithromycin still remained associated with a higher risk of liver injury when the potential effect of confounding by indication has been ruled out To the best of our knowledge no other paediatric studies have addressed the association between liver injury and individual antibiotic use specifically providing risk estimates Thus our results can only be compared with adult data descriptive studies from drug induced liver injury registries and results from signal detection analyses Fluoroquinolones sulfonamides tetracyclines cephalosporins macrolides and penicillins have been associated with liver injury Of course variations on risk estimates across antibiotic classes depend on different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics which play a crucial role in their manifestations of liver injury Our results confirmed the high risk of hepatitis or elevated liver enzymes as already described in a few case reports in children adolescents Moreover the high risk is also supported by our previous finding from signal detection analysis on ADR spontaneous reporting systems in children Clinical manifestation of the hepatitis may represent a direct toxic effect an idiosyncratic reaction or a cholestatic injury associated with its calcium precipitation which is known to typically occur after days of treatment liver injury is in adults and has also been detected as an hepatotoxic signal in children from ADR spontaneous reporting system analysis As in adults the typical presentation is sudden occurrence of fever and rash followed by jaundice within a few days or weeks of starting the medication and the typical pattern of serum enzyme elevations is mixed or cholestatic and often asymptomatic The mechanism underlying sulphonamide liver injury is probably immunoallergic In contrast to previous evidence our results showed different hepatotoxic profiles amongst macrolides A higher risk was observed for rokitamycin from the Italian market in and clarithromycin while the association was not significant for azithromycin The effect of reducing carryover time on the risk estimate for clarithromycin is consistent with the proposed mechanism suggesting the onset of liver injury Consistent with existing evidence amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is associated with a higher risk of liver injury than amoxicillin alone supporting the potential role of clavulanic acid in the toxic pathway Nevertheless we cannot definitely exclude an increased risk however small of liver injury associated with amoxicillin use Strengths First given the large study population identified from three longitudinal nationally representative GP and FP databases the results can be largely generalized to the paediatric population in these countries Second these electronic registries are maintained for daily routine healthcare purposes and the exposure is prospectively collected thus limiting the possibility of recall bias Third we were able to adjust the analyses for many potential confounders because of the availability of clinically relevant information in the study databases In addition we confirmed in the paediatric setting some risk factors for liver injury only known in adults such as underlying diabetes obesity hyperlipidaemia thyroid imbalance or congenital diseases Fourth confounding by indication is a main concern when studying the association between antibiotics and liver injury Accordingly the sensitivity analysis in which current exposure to amoxicillin was used as the reference category allowed to control for this potential confounding because amoxicillin is the most frequently used antibiotic in children and is usually considered less hepatotoxic than other antibiotics Thus the risk estimate during amoxicillin exposure can be regarded as a proxy of the background risk of liver injury Limitations This study has some potential limitations because of its observational nature Due to the limited number of exposed cases we could not explore the effect of heterogeneity by country Residual confounding due to unmeasured severity of infection cannot be excluded Moreover although we carefully excluded viral infections as underlying disease they still may represent the indication for antibiotic prescription With regard to liver injury case selection we adopted a very sensitive search strategy as in previous database studies investigating the same association and thereafter manually validating all automatically detected potential cases Nevertheless it is likely that outcome misclassification is randomly distributed among those exposed and unexposed to antibiotics thus again eventually leading to risk dilution As we used outpatient prescription and no dispensing data we might have misclassified the exposure However if present such a bias would likely be between cases and controls thus underestimating the actual risk We could not exclude the potential effect of diagnostic bias on the risk estimates because children exposed to specific hepatotoxic antibiotics might receive liver function tests more likely than children exposed to other drugs Moreover the analyses were not stratified by however since antibiotics are usually responsible for idiosyncratic liver injury reactions i e by definition it is unlikely that the risk of liver injury is influenced by the dose of antibiotic The system of medical record databases did not allow to collect and then to explore the medications such as paracetamol to be hepatotoxic in children Thus although we were able to identify paracetamol as a potential risk factor for liver injury in children despite the low number of cases and controls exposed we failed to test it as an effect modifier Lastly the limited number of cases exposed to individual antibiotics resulted in wide CIs particularly for cephalosporin antibiotics As a result their risk estimates need to be interpreted with caution Conclusion The use of antibiotics in paediatric outpatients is associated with an increased risk of liver injury with substantial differences in risk among individual antibiotics In particular after several analyses the potential risk of liver injury in children was found to be associated with current exposure to ceftriaxone cotrimoxazole and clarithromycin Paediatricians should be aware of this risk when using these antibiotics even if for short periods From a methodological point of view this study demonstrates that combining data from different databases is crucial in paediatric postmarketing surveillance to provide the large sample size required for the adequate assessment of drug safety profiles in routine clinical care However a larger and more heterogeneous sample size is needed to investigate safety in terms of less commonly used antibiotics or even other medications Electronic

changes were made Purpose of Review Arboviruses viruses transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes ticks sandflies and fleas are a significant threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential The geographical distribution of diseases such as West Nile Rift Valley fever Dengue Chikungunya and Zika has expanded over the last decades Countries of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions are not spared Outbreaks of WN are repeatedly reported in the Mediterranean basin Human cases of RVF were reported at the southern borders of the Maghreb region For this reason establishing the basis for the research to understand the potential for the future emergence of these and other arboviruses and their expansion into new geographic areas became a public health priority In this context the European network gathering laboratories in countries from the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions seeks to improve the surveillance animals humans and by reinforcing capacity building and harmonizing national surveillance systems to address this important human and veterinary health issue The aim of this review is to give an exhaustive overview of arboviruses and their vectors in the region Recent Findings The data presented underline the importance of surveillance in the implementation of more adapted control strategies to combat diseases Partner laboratories within the MediLabSecure network present a wide range of infrastructures and have benefited from different training programs Summary Although reporting of arboviral presence is not carried out in a systematic manner the expansion of the area where arboviruses are present cannot be disputed This reinforces the need for increasing surveillance capacity building in this region to prevent future emergences Keywords Arboviruses Vectors Emergence Surveillance Mediterranean and Black Sea regions Springer International Publishing AG Introduction The global distribution and disease burden associated to arboviruses have increased over recent years Unexpectedly Chikungunya hit northeastern Italy in and struck France in and Dengue entered the European scene in followed by more human cases in subsequent years A more recent threat is the Zika virus which is still unreported in the European territory including the Mediterranean region despite the increasing number of imported cases In countries of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions the epidemiology risk transmission etc of arboviruses remains poorly characterized MediLabSecure is a European project that has established a laboratory network including partners from countries of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions These countries are in the Balkans around the Black Sea in South Caucasus Middle East and North Africa As they share common public health issues and threats the overall objective of MediLabSecure is to increase through capacity building and harmonization of surveillance systems the health security in the whole Mediterranean region Emerging viruses that are pathogens for humans and or animals are at the heart of this project West Nile Dengue Chikungunya and Rift Valley Fever Within this One Health network a subset of laboratories are dedicated to medical and veterinary entomology while others are focused on human virology animal virology and public health The entomologists target mosquitoes identified as present threats or with potential risk of emergence in the concerned region Aedes mosquitoes Aedes aegypti Stegomyia aegypti and Aedes albopictus Stegomyia albopicta responsible for transmission of Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus to humans and Culex mosquitoes g Culex pipiens implicated in the transmission of West Nile virus Other arboviruses transmitted by sandflies or ticks g hemorrhagic fever virus transmitted by Hyalomma tick are also considered in the MediLabSecure program activities The Past of Diseases in Europe Dengue was not uncommon in the Mediterranean area in the past The disease was reported in Athens in which was the theater of the last major epidemic on the European continent with million cases and deaths It seemed that clinical severity was due to the sequential circulation of viruses and Aedes aegypti the vector of dengue in Greece disappeared from the Eastern Mediterranean after Since then no local transmission of Dengue has been recorded in Europe until when autochthonous cases of Dengue were reported in Croatia and France Yellow Fever is mainly transmitted to humans by Ae aegypti While originating from Africa YF was first reported in the Caribbean after the introduction of its vector via the slave trade from West Africa Yellow Fever and Ae aegypti were introduced around in harbors of Western Europe Outbreaks occurred on the Iberian Peninsula Sevilla Cadiz Malaga Lisbon Porto France Brest Rochefort and Italy during the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries More than people died in Barcelona between and and more than in Lisbon in West Nile has been discovered in Africa in and circulated on the continent mainly associated with mild symptoms Since the new viral strains were responsible for increased incidence of human diseases in Europe While lineage was repeatedly isolated in Europe and North Africa lineage historically endemic in Africa and Madagascar has been recently associated with human cases in Hungary with subsequent spread into Austria Italy Russia Greece Serbia and Croatia Currently WNV is present in Africa the Middle East Europe Asia America and has become the most widely distributed of the encephalitic flaviviruses Contrary to related flaviviruses such as DENV and YFV WNV can be transmitted by wide range of vector species and has been detected in more than different mosquito species The Vectors of Arboviruses in Europe Aedes aegypti This mosquito was common in southern Europe and the Middle East at the beginning of twentieth century It was present in southern Europe and Western Asia at the beginning of twentieth century in Syria Lebanon Turkey Greece former Yugoslavia Italy Corsica and Spain The species was the vector of a YF outbreak in Livorno in Italy in Following the development of sanitation and management of urban water collections and vector control with DDT the vector disappeared from continental Europe after the The last record of Ae aegypti in Europe was in Desenzano del Garda province northern in An Ae Aegypti outbreak was reported in Madeira in After decades of absence Ae aegypti is back to the Eurasian continent more specifically around the Black Sea in southern Russia Apkhazeti and Georgia in and Turkey Major outbreaks associated with Ae aegypti may occur in South Europe as this mosquito was responsible for large epidemics of Dengue in Greece in Additionally this species is a vector of CHIKV and ZIKV Aedes albopictus From its native in the forests of Asia Ae albopictus has succeeded in colonizing most continents in the past years The species was recorded for the first time in Europe in Albania in then in Italy in and is now present in European countries Today it is established in most countries of the Mediterranean Sea including Lebanon Syria and Israel This mosquito is susceptible to arboviruses including CHIKV DENV and YFV when provided by experimental infections Unexpectedly Ae albopictus was responsible for CHIKV and DENV cases in Europe Chikungunya virus emerged in Europe in Italy in and in France in and Dengue virus was detected in patients in Croatia in and in France in Culex pipiens Cx pipiens complex should be considered as a polytypic species differentiated into several forms The species Cx pipiens is commonly found in the Palearctic and Oriental regions and described under two morphologically identical biotypes named pipiens and molestus which show distinct feeding behavior Biotype pipiens prefers birds as blood hosts whereas the biotype molestus prefers mammals Hybrids between the two biotypes have an intermediate host preference which makes them ideal vectors to bridge arboviruses such as WN and Usutu from birds to mammals The epidemiological cycle of WN disease involves migratory birds acting as reservoir and ornithophilic Culex mosquitoes mainly as vectors amplifying viral traffic between bird populations Migratory birds ensure the introduction of the virus from Africa into temperate areas North Africa and Europe Humans and horses present clinical symptoms sometimes severe but are generally considered hosts as the level of viremia they develop is not high enough to infect mosquitoes Ticks In Europe ticks are the most important vectors of human and animal pathogens They transmit several viruses such as encephalitis virus and hemorrhagic fever virus that are reemerging in many parts of the world viruses are traditionally maintained in a natural cycle between vector ticks and wild animal hosts humans being accidental hosts New TBVs are continually being discovered presumably resulting from the proliferation of ticks in many regions of the world and incursion of humans into habitats Ixodes ricinus is the most widespread and abundant European tick presenting a high potential as vector of different pathogens Borrelia bacteria responsible for Lyme disease Anaplasma spp Rickettsia Babesia and Theileria Hyalomma ticks are aggressive species which search for humans actively Hyalomma marginatum and Hyalomma anatolicum are the main vectors of CCHF Other species of Rhipicephalus Boophilus Haemaphysalis Amblyomma Dermacentor and Hyalomma genera play a role in maintaining enzootic circulation of CCHFV among tick vectors and wild domestic mammals The Situation of Arboviruses in Countries Around the Mediterranean and Black Sea Regions

Phlebotomus tobbi Phlebotomus similis Phlebotomus simici Sergentomyia dentata and Sergentomyia minuta with P neglectus being the most abundant and widespread species in Albania A new phlebovirus provisionally named Adria virus has been detected in pools of sandflies trapped close to the Adriatic Sea and This new virus is genetically close to Arbia virus at nucleotide which belongs to the Salehabad serocomplex Its distribution and probable pathogenicity to humans are still unknown A new virus has been detected by a sequencing approach in sandflies of Kruje region in it has been named Balkan virus belonging to the group of Sandfly fever Naples virus The Balkan virus is closely related to the Tehran virus with and of divergence at nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively hemorrhagic fever virus is endemic in Albania with intermittent outbreaks The first CCHF case was described in in the northern part of the country near the border with Kosovo Reemergence in the southern part of the country occurred in area bordering Ticks collected during the period from cattle were tested for presence of CCHFV RNA while serum samples collected from goats cattle hares and birds were tested for the presence of specific IgG antibodies to CCHFV One of the pools of ticks consisting of four female Hyalomma spp ticks was found to carry CCHFV RNA with homology to sequences detected in patients from the same region Antibodies were not detected in cattle hares and birds but two goats presented high titers of IgG antibodies The shepherd of the flock was a member of a family affected by CCHF days before the collection of and he presented a mild form of the disease The overall CCHFV antibody seroprevalence rate for ruminants in Albania was In WN antibodies were detected in two human blood samples In confirmed cases of WNV infections have been reported in humans They were located in the coastal and in the central parts of Albania Algeria West Nile virus has been first isolated in Algeria in from a pool of Culex mosquitoes in the district of Djanet a Saharan oasis in the southeastern part of the country In the and several serological surveys revealed WNV circulation in human populations in the Sahara and steppe areas In more than human cases and fatalities were documented during an outbreak of WNV encephalitis in Tinerkouk oasis in the of Algeria In a retrospective serosurvey in Algiers and surrounding areas highlighted specific IgG in out of human samples tested During the same year a fatal case was reported for the first time in northern Algeria in the province of Jijel In two more cases were notified in the province of Guelma and in the Sahara desert in the province of Timimoune Recently the WNV lineage was detected in a pool of Culex perexiguus collected from the Oasis of Aougrout province of Timimoune Among phleboviruses reported in Algeria the Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus has been detected both in humans and sandflies in Tizi Ouzou district northern part of the country Between and serological evidence of Toscana virus circulation was reported both in humans and dogs During the same period TOSV was isolated from sandflies collected in Tizi Ouzou Furthermore several cases of meningitis and due to TOSV were detected these last years Regarding Rift Valley fever Algeria as well as all North Africa region is at high risk with respect to the epidemiological situation in neighboring countries in the Sahara with recurrent outbreaks in Mauritania and and recently in Niger So far there has been no human case reported in Algeria despite evidence from serological data that the virus circulated in the southern part of the country Between and only few imported cases of dengue were reported however the risk of autochthonous cases remains significant since Ae albopictus the vector of DENV CHIKV and ZIKV has been recently established in two high densely populated cities in Algeria Oran and Algiers Earlier this year the Hemorrhagic fever virus has been isolated from Hyalomma aegyptium ticks in the South of Algeria Armenia Armenia is located in the South Caucasus and is mainly composed of highlands and mountains Until now five genera of Culicidae have been described in Armenia The genus Anopheles is represented by six species An maculipennis An sacharovi An claviger An hyrcanus An superpictus An plumbeus The most common Culicine species are Cx pipiens Cx hortensis Cx theileri and Ae caspius In an extensive entomological survey has allowed to collect mosquitoes and Ixodidae ticks and identify distinct strains of arboviruses in four climatic regions the dry steppe to m above sea desert and m above sea mountain steppe mountain forest and Alpine From the mosquitoes were Anopheles Culex and Aedes From ticks are found Dermacentor Rhipicephalus Hyalomma Boophilus Haemaphisalis and Ixodes From mosquitoes four viruses have been isolated Batai Orthobunyavirus in Culex mosquitoes Sindbis Alphavirus in Culex Tahyna Orthobunyavirus in Aedes mosquitoes and WNV in Cx pipiens From ticks at least five viruses have been detected TBEV Flavivirus in Ixodes Dhori Thogotovirus in Ixodidae Bhanja in Haemaphysalis Tamdy Nairovirus in Ixodidae and CCFHV Nairovirus in Hyalomma Lebanon Lebanon is located on the eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea that is considered endemic for several arboviral diseases such as West Nile that has been reported from neighboring countries Israel and Turkey A number of epidemics of Dengue fever had occurred in Lebanon in the past of which one was reported from Beirut region and affected more than individuals in A serological survey conducted in to using the test showed a seroprevalence for WNV and DENV of and respectively During the malaria control program and as a result of mosquito control efforts Ae aegypti the widespread dengue vector was eliminated from the country With the beginning of the civil war in all vector control programs ceased and never resumed since then Consequently mosquito populations became a public health burden and a source of nuisance Entomological studies conducted in showed a widespread of Cx pipiens in the country in addition to the presence of other arbovirus vectors such as Cx perexiguus a species involved in the transmission of WNV in Israel Moreover Ae albopictus was introduced to Lebanon and recorded for the first time in This mosquito is now established in the country and is widespread in the coastal areas around big cities and in middle altitude humid regions Local strains of the Asian tiger mosquito showed to be competent mainly for transmission of CHIKV but also DENV In an outbreak of Sandfly fever virus occurred in Nahr El Bared near Tripoli North Lebanon More than cases were declared among Lebanese soldiers during military operations A Sandfly fever virus strain close to the Sicilian strain was identified as the causative agent Ministry of Health sources unpublished viruses have never been documented in Lebanon Some of these viruses such as CCHFV occur in some neighboring countries Turkey and Iran Presently Lebanon is considered at risk for the occurrence of several arboviral diseases such as WNV Not only is Lebanon situated in an endemic area but it also constitutes a major stopover for migrating birds WNV principal reservoir Aedes viruses such as CHIKV DENV and ZIKV should also be regarded as potential threats Their introduction to the country is highly likely if we consider the important flux of Lebanese expatriates coming from endemic areas in Latin America Africa and Asia Libya Libya has become a place of passage for migrants who cross the country to Europe They mainly come from Africa where several arboviral diseases are endemic As well the illegal animal trade can be a risk for the introduction of zoonotic viruses such as RVFV Libya is then subjected to regular serological surveys for arbovirus antibodies In the most recent survey human blood samples collected in the country were examined to determine the seroprevalence to zoonotic viruses and bacteria causing acute febrile illness Antibodies against WNV SFNV SFSV Sindbis virus and RVFV have been detected For WNV the prevalence among the Tripoli population is and of the population in the Yfran area for TOSV The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia In the Republic of Macedonia CCHF and WN are mandatory notifiable diseases In the first outbreak of CCHF occurred in the Ciflik village Tetovo with confirmed cases of which there were two deaths Until new cases of CCHF were notified During the period only one new case was registered From a total of ticks collected from cattle sheep and goat the ratio between Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus ticks was Between and a seroepidemiological study for CCHFV on serum samples collected from cattle the prevalence of antibodies rated up to in the cattle population from the Northeastern region of Macedonia Serological investigation on human for WNV IgM and IgG was performed since by ELISA Until human cases with symptoms of neurologic illness were tested were positive with WNV IgM antibodies Moldova WNV is the main arbovirus isolated in Moldova It has been detected in ticks in central and southern regions of Moldova between and Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor marginatus and from Nisporeni Hincesti and Vulcanesti regions CCHFV has been isolated from I ricinus D marginatus and Haemaphysalis punctata between and from Slobozia Nisporeni Hincesti and regions TBEV was isolated from D marginatus in in Nisporeni region and from mosquitoes in Moldova Batai virus has been detected in An maculipennis s l in in Zberoaia village Tahyna virus and WNV were isolated from mosquitoes in Moldova Recent epidemiological studies in Romania in the Danube Delta close to the border to Moldova reported the presence of WNV lineage in mosquitoes and Ixodidae ticks collected from migratory birds Migratory birds are reservoir hosts for a number of arboviruses and play an important role in distributing pathogens within and between countries The Danube Delta is one of the most important migratory sites in Europe and the risk of arbovirus dissemination through the birds to Moldova is extremely high Montenegro Using different trapping methods of adults and immature stages sampling sites have been examined during sampling nights in of municipalities in Montenegro A total of mosquito species were identified Anopheles potential vectors of malaria An saccharovi An maculipennis An plumbeus Aedes with Aedes vexans and Ae caspius potential vector of RVFV Ae albopictus of CHIKV and Culex with Cx modestus and Cx pipiens potential vector of WNV and RVFV Cs Culiseta annulata Cs longiareolata and Coquillettidia Cq richiardii and Cq buxtoni done by the LOVCEN project in cooperation with the MediLabSecure and VectorNet Montenegro is a country susceptible to be hit by a viral disease as its neighboring country Croatia which experienced in an autochthonous transmission of DENV Morocco The most prevalent arbovirus in Morocco is WNV mainly affecting horses with epizootics detected in and The viral isolates from to belonged to WNV lineage clade In WNV infection was first detected in a patient In a serosurvey of wild birds confirmed the circulation of WNV in native birds Serological surveillance confirmed that WNV is widely present Culex pipiens is highly suspected in the transmission of WNV in Morocco Moreover RVF is another arbovirus also transmitted by Cx pipiens which circulates at a common border with Mauritania where the first West African outbreak of RVF occurred in Following this epidemic Mauritania has experienced several other episodes in and In following unusual heavy rains an epidemic affecting mainly camels presenting severe clinical signs and high mortalities was reported in northern Mauritania It has been suggested that the oasis can play a role as a site of emergence of RVF in the Maghreb where and entomological conditions are suitable for vector development The border with Mauritania consists of hundreds of kilometers which are a real strainer to unauthorized migrants nomads and domestic animals Serological surveys of humans and animals should be reinforced in addition to viral isolations in mosquitoes Apart from its role as vector Cx pipiens is mainly considered a nuisance in most urban areas It is for this reason that it has been targeted for years in mosquito control programs The most widely used insecticides are pyrethroids organophosphorus and carbamates Although the level of resistance to insecticides of this mosquito is the object of a regular surveillance by the Ministry of Health since published data remain fragmentary Overall Cx pipiens populations showed significant resistance to insecticides used compromising the strategy of mosquito control Other arboviruses such as DENV CHIKV and ZIKV were not yet detected in Morocco However the vector Ae albopictus has been detected recently in the town of Rabat Regarding viruses TOSV is known to be present in Morocco It was isolated from P sergenti and P longicupis collected in north and center of Morocco between and Moreover CCHFV has been isolated from Hyalomma marginatum ticks in South Morocco in Palestine Only sporadic cases of WN have been detected in Palestine Since six human cases were reported in the West Bank of Palestine with four cases occurring in the northern districts cases in in Nablus and Jenin districts and cases in in Qalqilia and two cases in Jericho city in All patients were males between and years old One patient from Jericho died from the WNV infection Cx pipiens was suspected as the main it is present in the West Bank especially in Tubas Qalqiliah Jericho and Bethlehem districts and active all year long with the highest densities in summer Other arboviral diseases are occasionally detected CCHF SINV fever and Sandfly fever In Palestine arboviral diseases must be notified to the Preventive Medicine Division in the district of the residence Then a special investigation is set off with reports to the Central Preventive Medicine Department Control measures are immediately implemented by the vector control unit of the Health Promotion Department In addition to Cx pipiens three other mosquito species were reported Ae albopictus An claviger and Cs longiareolata Aedes albopictus widely found in the West Bank Qalqiliah Jericho and Bethlehem is active from March to November with the highest densities reported in August Monthly investigations at district level for breeding sites are implemented by the vector control unit In about sites were inspected for mosquito breeding and were positive for immature stages percent of positive sites were treated using environmental measures and treated with pesticides or Bacillus thuringiensis Serbia Serbia experienced the second largest outbreak of WN in Europe with confirmed human cases in http ecdc europa eu en healthtopics Pages dpuf The largest numbers of human cases as well as outbreaks of various magnitudes have been reported repeatedly in the Vojvodina province of northern Serbia since in in in and in http www batut org rs index php The first serological investigation for WNV was conducted in and antibodies against WNV were found in of human sera Between and the seroprevalence for WNV was in patients who had been hospitalized for encephalitis or meningoencephalitis Information on asymptomatic cases was also provided among samples taken from healthy people In the seroprevalence was estimated to be of A total of individuals tested in were exposed to at least one mosquito risk factor Within this group were seropositive for WNV Most of the people with IgG positive against WNV did not have screen protections on windows and doors of their houses while only of those using window screens were seropositive for WNV During the same period mosquito specimens sampled on migratory and domestic bird reservoirs were all negative for WNV RNA A serological analysis by ELISA based on WNV recombinant envelope E protein and PRNT showed for the first time in Serbia that of horses from the northern part of country sampled in presented specific neutralizing WNV antibodies Due to the absence of routine diagnosis and the limited resources of hospitals in Serbia human cases of meningoencephalitis of unknown origin were not tested until In addition regular surveillances of sentinel chicken horses or mosquitoes are not performed Consequently the approach used to search for the virus in Serbia had been focused on detection of humans and virus in mosquitoes In WNV linage was detected in Cx pipiens In August an outbreak of WN in humans was reported for the first time in Serbia http www episouthnetwork org content http ecdc europa eu en healthtopics Pages index aspx During the same year viral RNA was detected for the first time in nine wild birds All these isolates belonged to the WNV lineage and were closely related to strains responsible for recent outbreaks in Greece Italy and Hungary From to WNV surveillance activities in Vojvodina province northern Serbia were performed as part of ongoing research projects In a specific and integrated surveillance system targeting mosquitoes wild and sentinel birds as well as horses was set up by the National Veterinary Directorate in Vojvodina The main goals of this nationwide WNV surveillance have been to provide warnings of WNV circulation and tools for controlling the spread of WNV infections in humans Tunisia Since the first half of last century rapid urbanization and changes in agriculture practices have created environmental conditions favorable to the proliferation of Cx perexiguus and Cx pipiens The latter became the dominant species in urban and rural areas Consequently WN became the most important arboviral disease for public health In Tunisia the first outbreak of meningoencephalitis due to WNV was observed in autumn in two coastal districts and causing more than cases with deaths The WNV belonged to the lineage strain which is closely related to the group of American Israeli viruses collected between and The second WN outbreak was reported in in all East coastal districts Twenty patients with neurological signs including three fatal cases were reported in the district of Sousse In a total of sera collected from healthy patients from three different districts center and were investigated by ELISA to detect specific IgG against WNV Specific IgG were detected in of studied population The seroprevalence varied largely between the three districts high endemicity in the center in Kairouan moderate in the southern region in the Sfax and low in the north in the Bizerte The third important outbreak of WN was observed in cases with neurological signs were confirmed by serological tests patients died Equids are also affected the serological investigation tested by competitive immunoassay of horses conducted in in the southern west region of the country showed that had neutralizing antibodies The prevalence was significantly higher in areas close to the oasis compared with that of the surrounding arid areas Sandfly fever viruses belonging to the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family were occasionally reported They include two main serocomplexes Naples fever Naples virus and Sicilian fever Sicilian virus which are associated with human diseases Besides Toscana virus is a variant of Sandfly fever Naples virus It is endemic in Mediterranean countries especially in Tunisia In a recent study Fezaa et al showed that out of patients with neurological disorder tested using ELISA n were IgM positive for TOSV Of these patients n were IgG positive In addition n of the cerebrospinal fluid samples tested by were positive for TOSV One CSF sample tested by revealed the presence of SFSV By TOSV was detected in Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi collected in north Tunisia In addition the Punique virus was identified in P perniciosus Among healthy individuals from various regions of Tunisia tested by ELISA for IgGs people were positive Seroprevalence varied with bioclimatic regions and gender Usutu Virus which is a emerging Flavivirus antigenically close to WNV and also transmitted by Culex mosquitoes has never been reported in humans in Tunisia In a recent study antibody titers against USUV were reported in equines In a serological investigation Nabli et al recorded that of human serum samples n from different regions of Tunisia were positive to the Sindbis virus Turkey Arbovirus screening in vertebrate hosts and vectors conducted in the last years have revealed the activity of arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes sandflies ticks and Culicoides Among viruses WNV is known to be present in Turkey since the After the detection of serological evidence of WNV in various animals cattle dog horse and in eight provinces human cases were detected The WNV Lineage clade was confirmed in both humans and horses Further studies corroborated the circulation of the virus in the East and as well as South East and South and West parts of the country and The virus was also detected in primary and secondary vectors Cx pipiens s s and Ae caspius samples in North West in Cx quinquefasciatus and Cx perexiguus in the South These results also confirmed the presence of the most important vector of the virus worldwide Cx quinquefasciatus with DNA barcoding for the first time in the country Established populations of the invasive Ae aegypti and Ae albopictus were recorded in the northeast of the country in Due to the fact that these species are involved in the transmission of CHIKV DENV YFV and ZIKV they will become a public health concern Data from blood donors in recent years have shown evidence for DENV exposure in Central Anatolia thus its reemergence is probable Imported cases of CHIK also represent a threat On the other hand some major and novel Phlebovirus serotypes are endemic in Turkey Sandfly fever Sicilian virus Naples virus and Toscana virus are known to be present in the country In addition Sandfly fever Turkish virus a variant of SFSV was discovered and Phlebotomus major s l is detected as the best vector candidate so far Last year Adana virus a novel Phlebovirus belonging to the Salehabad virus complex was identified with high seroprevalences in dogs goats sheeps but a low seroprevalence in humans A recent study revealed that dogs are candidate reservoirs of TOSV in Turkey and of this virus with Leishmania infantum is detected To put that into perspective of TOSV and WNV was also documented in a human case for the first time causing enhanced pathogenicity with severe clinical outcomes Caused by biting midges bluetongue virus is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock It was recorded in provinces of Turkey on Western North Western Eastern South Eastern and Central Anatolia throughout the years sharing lineages and with its neighboring countries encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever had a significant impact in Turkey Since there have been more than patients infected with CCHFV with around overall mortality rate Ticks collected from migratory birds were found infected with CCHFV genotype whereas CCHFV Europe I clade is known to be present in Central Anatolia In the same region a recent study has shown that clade I is also affecting the Anatolian wild sheep Ovis gmelinii anatolica The virus was also detected in the part of the country outside the endemic region for several tick species Conclusions Arboviruses viruses in particular including DENV CHIKV and WNV are becoming a global health issue spreading beyond their natural range of distribution mainly in Africa DENV and CHIKV have benefitted from increasing human mobility and the larger geographical distribution of the vectors Ae aegypti and Ae albopictus which expand their area of activity to new regions and continents including countries The introduction of these viruses in naive countries relies on long distance spread taking advantage of human travels By contrast the spread of WNV depends primarily on bird migration and local viral dynamics relying on activities of mosquito populations Given this global threat the surveillance system human and must be strengthened to prevent outbreaks and or to ensure the early detection of a potential epidemic These are the objectives of the MedilLabSecure project strengthen the preparedness for arboviral diseases in countries of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions that should be considered a unique episystem for emergence of diseases in Europe Failloux Ali Bouattour

evaluated by measuring understanding of serious risk and messages Methods Results from mandatory knowledge attitude and behavior surveys and voluntary patient surveys completed between June and June were analyzed and responses to questions relating to compliance with birth control measures and understanding of messages are presented by patient risk category Results In total patients were enrolled into the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide and completed mandatory surveys prior to medication dispense Of these completed an additional voluntary survey Among voluntary survey participants for all patient pregnancy risk categories reported compliance with birth control requirements was above when starting therapy and at At the beginning of therapy complete compliance was months later it was Patient understanding of messages was very high in all pregnancy risk groups notably for messages repeated at each physician visit Overall of patients knew that lenalidomide and thalidomide could cause birth defects which is part of the repeated educational messaging In contrast recalled that unused product should be returned to their healthcare professional which is not included in repeated messaging Conclusion The lenalidomide and thalidomide REMS programs enhance patient understanding of messages resulting in high levels of compliance with the birth control precautions essential to prevent fetal exposure to these known and potential human teratogens Overall compliance was maintained after months of and throughout therapy Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users http dx doi org Celgene Springer International Publishing Switzerland Key Points Regular risk evaluation and mitigation strategies patient survey data indicate high levels of understanding retention of REMS messages High compliance rates with REMS program contraception requirements were also reflected Introduction The exposure of thousands of unborn fetuses to thalidomide in the and resulted in major changes to the US pharmacovigilance and risk management legislation and regulations Thalidomide was first marketed in Europe as a sedative in the late and preclinical and clinical studies had led to the conclusion that it was in humans Thalidomide was found to be antiemetic and was used extensively to treat and prevent associated with pregnancy In two physicians independently associated thalidomide use in pregnancy with congenital malformations including phocomelia amelia syndactyly and underdeveloped long bones Fetal thalidomide exposure has also been associated with a range of internal defects resulting in an early mortality rate of around Once the link between thalidomide and birth defects was established the drug was withdrawn worldwide and US pharmaceutical regulatory processes were strengthened Interest in thalidomide revived when it was shown to be effective in treating erythema nodosum leprosum an inflammatory reaction that complicates lepromatous leprosy Subsequently thalidomide was found to inhibit the expression of tumor necrosis factor also known as a cytokine associated with wasting The HIV AIDS community began to use thalidomide to treat wasting creating a need to allow access to thalidomide for those who might benefit while preventing access by those who could be at risk from the teratogenic effects In thalidomide was approved by the US FDA for acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL Prior to its approval thalidomide was found to be leading to research into its use to treat angiomas and malignancies Subsequent clinical studies determined activity in multiple myeloma In thalidomide Celgene Corporation Summit NJ in combination with dexamethasone was approved by the FDA to treat newly diagnosed MM While Celgene was developing thalidomide it created chemical congeners called IMiD products that shared many of the immune modulatory and other properties of thalidomide Celgene discovered that each IMiD product had slightly different properties from each other and from thalidomide The first IMiD product to be commercialized was lenalidomide Celgene which was approved by the FDA in for the treatment of anemia due to or myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion abnormality and in in combination with dexamethasone for MM in patients who have received at least one prior therapy The approvals of lenalidomide and thalidomide were achieved in a different regulatory environment from that of the and and in tandem with approval of these drugs systems were implemented to prevent fetal exposure Since the FDA Amendments Act the FDA has required sponsors of new drug applications biologics license applications generic and biosimilar applications to submit a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program if there is concern that the risks of the product cannot be addressed by routine product labelling A REMS program is intended to ensure that through the implementation of additional measures the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks All REMS programs include a timetable for submission of assessments and the FDA may require that a REMS program includes a communication plan medication guide patient package insert to assure safe and an implementation system Lenalidomide and thalidomide have REMS programs with ETASUs that have two goals to prevent the risk of exposure and to inform prescribers patients and pharmacists of the serious risks and conditions of the product To achieve these goals some key messages in the REMS programs are repeated at each physician visit The repeated messages vary according to patient risk categories but include warnings on birth defects sexual intercourse birth control drug sharing and donations to blood and sperm banks One of the ETASU measures introduced to achieve these goals is to ensure the product is dispensed to patients enrolled in the REMS only after they have received and confirm they understand comprehensive education messages and agree to participate in frequent mandatory knowledge attitude and behavior surveys Additional voluntary patient surveys were conducted up to to examine patient understanding and compliance with measures While the FDA has been able to mandate REMS programs since published data available on the effectiveness of these programs are limited In an evaluation of REMS medication guides of medication guide assessments led to correct with higher correct response rates reported for REMS programs including ETASUs Previous analysis of voluntary survey data from the lenalidomide RevAssist risk management program reported over comprehension of messaging for male patients and females of childbearing potential This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of patient education activities in the lenalidomide and thalidomide REMS programs by analyzing the results of the mandatory KAB surveys and additional voluntary patient surveys to assess comprehension of messages and compliance with birth control measures Methods The surveys described here were conducted in support of a regulatory commitment of the REMS programs to serve as a practical indicator of conditions rather than for research purposes Mandatory surveys from June to June were interrogated alongside data from the voluntary surveys from June to February to establish receipt of patient brochures patient understanding of messages and reported compliance with birth control requirements Demographic data were collected for both survey populations Lenalidomide and Thalidomide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies Program The main elements of the Celgene REMS programs are presented in Fig Every prescriber intending to prescribe lenalidomide or thalidomide must first become certified into the respective REMS program A certified prescriber may then enroll patients into the REMS program in a similar manner The prescriber provides the patient with educational material highlighting the serious risks and conditions of the product and describes the frequent interactions with the REMS program during therapy All patient materials were written to be comprehensible by a patient at grade literacy levels The prescriber and patient choose a unique identifier that is used in future REMS interactions and information about the patient risk category age and indication is recorded in the Celgene REMS database Throughout therapy both the prescriber and the patient are required to provide the REMS program with information that confirms continued patient understanding of the measures before each subsequent prescription can be filled Fig Flowchart highlighting the main components of the Celgene risk evaluation and mitigation strategies programs PPAF agreement form The messages provided to patients prior to enrollment into the REMS program are as follows these products can cause birth defects contraceptive measures must be taken while receiving therapy these drugs cannot be shared patients must not donate blood to a blood bank any unused product must be returned to a healthcare professional This information is described in patient brochures and in the agreement form that is signed by patients and returned to Celgene The PPAF also includes patient demographics and International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes which are provided by the prescriber The serious risk messages are also conveyed in the prescriber brochure to ensure prescribers are sufficiently informed to educate their patients about the risks before initiating therapy messages appropriate to the risk categories are repeated at each physician visit Other patient resources include a patient resource kit which contains a REMS patient guide and an emergency contraception brochure These materials are provided to the patient at the time of enrollment by the prescriber in support of the PPAF discussion They are also available publicly on the REMS websites http www revlimidrems com for http www thalomidrems com for Additionally each patient is counseled by a counselor with a REMS Education and Counseling Checklist for Pharmacies before each dispense Importantly lenalidomide and thalidomide are dispensed to patients enrolled in the REMS only after they have received and confirmed they understand comprehensive messages All patients must agree to participate in frequent KAB surveys initially as well as during treatment with the frequency depending on patient risk category These surveys may be taken online via an interactive system or by calling the Celgene Customer Care Center Mandatory surveys occur monthly for boys men girls who have not undergone menarche and females of reproductive potential and every months for women not of reproductive potential The number and nature of questions varies between risk categories Mandatory surveys for adult males and females of reproductive potential include questions on the use of birth control methods and drug sharing The survey for females of reproductive potential also includes questions that confirm their risk category obtains confirmation of acceptable contraception behaviors as outlined by REMS and affirms the patient understands the potential for the product to cause birth defects Mandatory surveys are also completed by prescribers when a prescription is written Prescriber surveys include questions on contraception counselling pregnancy testing and drug prescribing All mandatory surveys for patients and prescribers are reviewed using a computer algorithm that discrepant responses that indicate a potential cause for concern Responses were identified as discrepant if they diverged from the desired answers or there was discrepancy between patient and prescriber responses If a flag occurs to halt the REMS authorization process an outbound call from Celgene is placed to the prescriber to provide the appropriate patient information to remedy the flag and verify conditions All flags must be resolved prior to drug dispense Voluntary Patient Survey Patients in the REMS program indicated on the PPAF whether they would be willing to participate in additional voluntary surveys initial survey for patients days from initial dispense and a for patients days from that further examined their understanding and compliance with measures in relation to the REMS program The patients who volunteered were categorized into one of four risk categories females of childbearing potential females not of childbearing potential and adult Of these patients one child and at least other patients were randomly selected each week for the voluntary patient population All eligible females of childbearing potential were included in the initial survey whereas of eligible females of childbearing potential were included in the survey no minimum or maximum number for patients in this category in either The remaining patients were randomly selected from the females not of childbearing potential minimum of four and adult males minimum of six The survey queried patients whether they were provided with the REMS program education materials and engaged in sufficient conversations with their healthcare providers to understand the contents Patients were then classified into pregnancy risk groups similar to those in the mandatory KAB survey and understanding and retention of educational materials was evaluated by sampling patients within days of the first lenalidomide or thalidomide prescription and after they had received therapy for at least months The voluntary surveys also assessed patient compliance with birth control requirements Acceptable forms of birth control for patients receiving lenalidomide and thalidomide include true abstinence or one highly effective and one additional effective method of contraception Highly effective contraception methods include an intrauterine device hormonal birth control pills or devices tubal ligation or vasectomy Additional effective methods include male condom diaphragm or cervical cap The THALOMID voluntary patient survey for female patients of childbearing potential is provided in the Electronic Supplementary Material Information provided during enrollment into the mandatory REMS program and the optional voluntary patient survey together with the results from the mandatory surveys was analyzed to determine the effectiveness of patient education activities Results Patients in the REMS Programs Between June and June a total of patients enrolled into the REMS programs including patients receiving lenalidomide and patients receiving thalidomide The vast majority of patients enrolled in the REMS were treated for MM with lower numbers of patients treated for myelodysplastic syndrome ENL and other conditions The distribution of patients by risk category is summarized in Fig a Consistent with published epidemiological data for MM there were more males than females Of the female patients were of reproductive potential and the majority were adult females not of reproductive potential indicating the older population expected for patients with the diseases associated with the use of these drugs Children represented of the enrolled patients Fig Characteristics of the patient populations a Distribution of patients enrolled in the lenalidomide and thalidomide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies programs between June and June by risk category N b Distribution of patients in the voluntary survey population by risk category N C Proportion of patients in the voluntary survey population who received and read the patient education brochure by risk category Of the patients enrolled in the REMS programs agreed to participate in the additional voluntary survey Of these patients were randomly selected for inclusion in the voluntary survey sample of whom responded The distribution of responding patients is presented by risk category in Fig b The proportion of patients in each risk category was generally consistent with those recorded for the whole population enrolled in the REMS programs with more females of reproductive potential as expected from the sampling strategy used The voluntary survey confirmed that of patients received the initial education materials from their healthcare professional and read them before starting treatment with lenalidomide or thalidomide During the study period mandatory patient surveys were performed and were flagged as a potential cause for concern Females of reproductive potential had the highest number of flagged surveys all of which were resolved before the patient received her prescription determined that were due to the patient not understanding or not complying with risk messages These reports were investigated and resolved prior to drug dispense as described in the Methods section A further of the surveys for females of reproductive potential were flagged because since their initial enrollment into the REMS program the patient had either had their uterus removed or their menstrual periods had stopped for more than months These patients were as females not of reproductive potential Table Distribution of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies patient survey flags by

understanding of most of these messages Importantly of patients knew that lenalidomide and thalidomide can cause birth defects which is part of the repeated educational messaging whereas recalled that unused product should be returned to their healthcare professional which is not included in repeated messaging Discussion Effectiveness of the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide in driving patient understanding and retention of messages was assessed using data from mandatory KAB assessments and voluntary patient surveys Patients surveyed had high levels of compliance with birth control requirements both initially and at as well as very high levels of understanding of messages This study determined that mandated REMS programs are effective tools for educating patients in the safe use of lenalidomide and thalidomide and compliance with measures by repeated messaging Previous studies have determined that levels of fetal exposure to both lenalidomide and thalidomide are very low in patients enrolled in US risk management programs for these drugs A third Celgene IMiD product pomalidomide approved in the USA for advanced MM in is distributed through an REMS identical to that for lenalidomide It is anticipated that the REMS program will be similarly effective for this product Patient understanding of messages in the Celgene REMS programs reported in this study for key messages related to pregnancy teratogenicity and sharing the is consistent with the high levels of understanding reported in a previous analysis of voluntary surveys conducted as part of the original lenalidomide risk management program However published data on the effectiveness of messaging in other REMS programs are limited A recent study investigating patient understanding of key risks based on medication guide assessments for drugs between September and June found that primary drug risk knowledge questions were answered correctly by of respondents on average Higher rates were recorded for REMS that also included ETASU or a communication plan and ETASU and The continued high understanding of messages for patients in the Celgene REMS programs is consistent with the higher rate of patient understanding in REMS programs with ETASUs and indicates the relative effectiveness of the Celgene programs The high reported adherence to birth control measures for the Celgene REMS programs is particularly important given the teratogenic potential of the drugs involved Thalidomide is a proven human teratogen and lenalidomide caused malformations in newborn monkeys in studies Therefore both must be considered products with teratogenic potential A limitation of the current study is that the surveys do not report on patient behavior which may not necessarily reflect survey responses In a study of oral contraception use in over million US women of childbearing age only of those receiving both category X medications and oral contraceptives were considered to be adherent to oral contraception Consequently an estimated of pregnancies in the USA occur in women receiving medications of known teratogenic risk D or In this context the high reported adherence to birth control requirements in this study over indicates the effectiveness of repeated messaging enabling understanding of birth control requirements in the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide Crucially Celgene risk management measures have been executed over years with no reported births with teratogenicity due to Celgene products In this study understanding was particularly high for messages that were part of repeated messaging For each of these safety messages around of patients demonstrated understanding considerably higher than for a message not included in repeated messaging This demonstrates the crucial role of repeated messaging in the REMS programs particularly for messages related to teratogenicity and the need for adequate birth control measures The high rate of understanding of these messages is reflected in a high rate of reported adherence to birth control measures Repeated messaging has previously been shown to be effective in influencing prescriber behavior in a study of the provision of calcium and vitamin D supplements to UK patients receiving drugs In the Celgene REMS programs the use of mandatory monthly patients of reproductive or other KAB surveys allows continued understanding of messages to be regularly and continually assessed prior to dispensing Approximately of the surveys completed during this study were flagged providing the opportunity to investigate and resolve concerns before lenalidomide or thalidomide was dispensed It should be noted that the surveys described here were conducted in support of a regulatory commitment of the REMS programs to serve as a practical indicator of conditions rather than for research purposes Consequently the goals and objectives of these surveys differ from those of surveys conducted as purely research exercises One limitation of this study is the limited duration of Messaging within REMS programs needs to be developed to prevent patient with repeated messaging which could potentially diminish attention to serious risk and messaging There was no evidence in this study that the repeated messaging in the lenalidomide and thalidomide REMS programs led to a reduction in attention to safety however there was no beyond months Additional studies are required to assess whether repeated messaging leads to diminution of patient attention In addition although analysis of the patient surveys allowed us to assess patient understanding of REMS messaging it did not provide any data on the impact of the REMS programs on prescribers We believe that the results presented in this report the record of birth control compliance with other category X drugs and the overarching REMS programs rationale should be considered when evaluating the burden incurred by healthcare providers in relation to REMS programs In a survey of healthcare providers in Southern California USA most respondents considered that REMS improved patient safety whereas considered that REMS was very or somewhat meaningful in improving patient safety Among oncology prescribers N considered that REMS improved patient safety whereas responded that REMS was meaningful Despite this the additional administrative burden incurred by REMS programs is a recognized concern among oncology practitioners To mitigate this online enrollment systems have been developed to minimize the administrative burden on healthcare providers enrolling patients in the REMS programs for lenalidomide and thalidomide Further studies are required to assess the burden of REMS programs and to evaluate potential improvements to the REMS process The necessary extra administrative burden incurred by these REMS programs must be considered in the context of the risk of fetal exposure and the effectiveness of the programs in preventing this exposure Data presented here and elsewhere clearly demonstrate that these programs drive the high levels of patient understanding and compliance necessary to prevent fetal exposure Conclusion Lenalidomide and thalidomide are both important treatments for an increasing variety of malignant conditions For these and other teratogenic compounds to be used safely it is crucial that both the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities work to minimize the risk of fetal exposure The data from this study support the conclusion that the lenalidomide and thalidomide REMS programs in the USA enhance patient understanding of messages leading to high levels of compliance with the birth control precautions essential to prevent fetal exposure to these known and potential human teratogens The with the voluntary survey means there are no data on patient understanding of the REMS However the mandatory surveys show that overall compliance was maintained after months of and throughout therapy Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material Supplementary material Acknowledgements Medical writing

however the role of VTA in regulation when directly activated or inhibited remains unknown In this study we investigated the effects of activation or inhibition of VTA neurons on behavior using the pharmacogenetic receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs approach Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to confirm the microinjection sites and combined with electrophysiological experiments to determine whether the VTA neurons were activated or inhibited The VTA neurons were excited confirmed by expression and firing in whereas the VTA neurons inhibited by reduction of firing

neurons were excited at the total wakefulness amount increased while NREM and REM sleep decreased and respectively for h No difference of the amount and EEG power density of the NREM sleep was observed following the arousal effects of CNO The inhibition of VTA neurons during active or inactive periods gave rise to no change in the time spent in the wakefulness REM and NREM sleep compared with control The results indicated that VTA neurons activated pharmacogentically played important roles in promoting wakefulness Keywords N Pharmacogenetics Ventral tegmental area National Natural Science Foundation of China Huang Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project Yang http dx doi org National Natural Science Foundation of China Yang Japanese Society of Sleep Research Introduction The ventral tegmental area contains dopamine containing neurons and is traversed by many blood vessels and nerve fibers Close to its poorly defined borders are found DA and containing neurons The VTA comprises several subdivisions and neurons synthesizing neurotransmitters such as DA GABA or glutamate The DA neurons arises in the VTA and projects to the septal area olfactory tubercle nucleus accumbens amygdaloid complex and piriform cortex and the medial prefrontal cingulate and entorhinal areas The VTA is crucial for brain functions such as voluntary movement and behavior as well as cognition emotion reward working memory and decision making Accordingly DA midbrain system dysfunction is associated with neurologic and psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia addiction attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disease Several lines of evidence suggest that DA signals are closely associated with regulation of activity In humans malfunction of the brain DA system is associated with neuropsychopathy with disruption of sleep as one symptom Systemic administration of a selective D receptor agonist induced an increase of wakefulness and a reduction of slow wave sleep and REM sleep On the other hand low doses of D receptor agonist reduced W and increased SWS and REM whereas large doses induced the opposite effect promote wakefulness by inhibiting the DA reuptake transporter and thereby enhancing the extracellular DA levels in mice The results are often controversial by drug effects on targets outside the VTA area or by potential disruption of neural circuits during development after gene knockout The effects of activation or inhibition of VTA neurons on sleep wake behavior remains to be directly tested The VTA is a heterogeneous area where dopaminergic and neurons are intermixed The pharmacogenetic technique receptors exclusively activated by a designer DREADD utilizes extrinsic muscarinic receptors for excitation and for that have lost their affinity for endogenous acetylcholine but can still be activated by a synthetic inert ligand N Activation of by CNO has previously been shown to activate neurons through a phospholipase mechanism CNO can also stimulate the Gi receptor thereby activating the inwardly rectifying potassium channel resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing In this way the activity of VTA neurons can be manipulated temporarily and reversibly Our study established a direct link between the activity of midbrain VTA neurons and arousal promotion The results will contribute for understanding the roles of the VTA area in regulation of sleep and wake states which will provide a therapeutic basis for sleep disorders involved in VTA neurons Materials and methods Animals adult male mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences The animals were housed in individual cages at a constant temperature with a relative humidity on an automatically controlled

difference of the amount and EEG power density of the NREM sleep was observed during the time period following the arousal effects of CNO Discussion The first occurrence of the VTA in the literature is due to Tsai in In its description of the opossum brain he identified with Nissl and Golgi staining a region lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus as the trigonum interpeduncular Recently the VTA DA neurons were thought to be homogeneous in their properties and behavioral functions such that they express characteristic phasic excitatory responses to rewards and cue that predict rewards while being inhibited by omission of rewards A prior study wherein the neurons in mesencephalon were given electrolytic lesion in cats and the animals had an obvious decrease in behavioral waking indicated the neurons played a role in sleep wake regulation However this method produced irreversible death of neurons and may also lead to some compensatory reactions of other brain areas Despite higher dopamine levels usually associated with arousal the previous studies did not establish a direct link between the activity of VTA neurons and wakefulness In the present study we applied DREADD to pharmacogenetically manipulate the activity of VTA neurons DREADD utilizes receptor signaling which can affect neuronal activity in a relatively chronic and consistent manner and allow investigation of the behavioral effects of activation or inhibition of VTA neurons Besides the AAV has proven to be very effective for studying neuronal function and behavior it is highly neurotropic and importantly it can drive transgene expression at significantly high levels necessary to alter neuronal function and produce a behavioral phenotype In this study we confirmed its effect by in vitro electrophysiological experiments in which the spontaneous firing rates of the neurons were increased obviously while the neurons were inhibited by CNO administration In this way we can selectively manipulate the neurons in the VTA acutely and reversibly Considering that the firing activity of DA neurons peaked between and and between and we examined the effects of the pharmacogenetic activation of the VTA neurons either at or at on behaviors in mice We found no matter the level of sleep pressure was high or low and the activation of VTA produced remarkable increase in wakefulness which lasted longer when CNO was given during the active period in mice The findings demonstrate for the first time that injection of CNO in mice expressing in the VTA is able to significantly increase arousal Our results were consistent with previous reports that DAT knockout mice exhibited an increase in wakefulness selectively activating midbrain dopaminergic neurons using DREADD induced hyperactivity in mice and optogenetic stimulation of VTA dopaminergic neurons initiated and maintained wakefulness in mice Although the VTA is generally known as the source of dopaminergic projection neurons the VTA contains multiple cell types dopaminergic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons Therefore we think that all types of VTA neurons were simultaneously activated by this nonspecific pharmacogenetic DREADD system VTA DA neurons project heavily to several limbic structures including the nucleus accumbens amygdala and prefrontal cortex In the rat both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons form local synapses in the VTA and project in parallel with the DA neurons to limbic regions As a result the increased wakefulness induced by activation of VTA may be caused not only by activated dopamine neurons but also by glutamatergic neurons It may increase the dopamine and glutamate levels in targeted area which may also contribute to the wakefulness It is recognized that sleep is under the control of circadian and homeostatic processes and animals will attempt to regain or compensate for sleep that was previously depleted Previous studies showed that sleep deprivation often accompanied with the increase of EEG power density of NREM Our results showed that the activation of VTA no matter during the day or night is responsible for wakefulness However the NREM sleep amount or delta power in mice expressing receptors treated with CNO following the induced extended wakefulness did not increase The possible reasons may be involved the different methods of sleep deprivation in which gentle handling or water platform techniques were employed in the previous studies whereas the arousal was induced by VTA activation using DREADD approach The present phenomena was in agreement with study in which they did not find EEG or behavioral sleep rebound even after days of induced wakefulness by chemogenetic stimulation of the pontine parabrachial nucleus To investigate whether the VTA has some roles in physiological sleep regulation the sleep analysis in mice with was carried out The inhibition of VTA neurons was confirmed with recording in which CNO bath application decreased the firing of the positive neurons We found there were no differences in the mice microinjected with between CNO and saline group in behavior The reason may be a comprehensive effect by inhibition of different type neurons in VTA When the VTA nucleus was inhibited on one hand the dopaminergic neurons were on the other hand the inhibition of the GABAergic neurons could produce disinhibition of local dopaminergic neurons However we cannot exclude some roles of single cell type neurons in VTA in regulation under physiological conditions In fact a recent study has shown the VTA dopaminergic neurons are necessary for wakefulness since the inhibition of these neurons suppressed wakefulness in mice In this study we investigated the role of the VTA in sleep wake however viruses indiscriminately transduce most cell types within the introduced region Next we will manipulate neuronal subtypes independently to understand the genetic basis of the phenomena for therapeutic purposes Compliance with ethical standards Conflict of interest This was not an industry supported study None of the authors has any financial interest or conflicts of interest related to

There is increasing interest in making patient participation an integral component of medical research However practical guidance on optimizing this engagement in healthcare is scarce Since patient involvement has been one of the key features of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology international consensus effort Based on a review of cumulative data from qualitative studies and internal surveys among OMERACT participants we explored the potential benefits and challenges of involving patient research partners in conferences and working group activities We supplemented our review with personal experiences and reflections regarding patient participation in the OMERACT process We found that between and patients have attended OMERACT conferences of whom had sustained many other patients contributed to OMERACT working groups Their participation provided face validity to the OMERACT process and expanded the research agenda Essential facilitators have been the financial commitment to guarantee sustainable involvement of patients at these conferences procedures for recruitment selection and support and dedicated time allocated in the program for patient issues Current challenges include the representativeness of the patient panel risk of and disparity in and perception of involvement In conclusion OMERACT has embedded patient involvement in the process on the measurement of core health outcomes This integrative process continues to evolve iteratively We believe that the practical points raised here can improve participatory research implementation http dx doi org Outcomes Research Institute Bingham Clifton O III Springer International Publishing Switzerland Key Points for Decision Makers Outcome Measures in Rheumatology has shown that involvement of patients in research is beneficial for identifying and validating outcomes that matter to patients Building and sustaining successful partnerships with patients requires restructuring of the research process and investing time and budgets into training and support of patient research partners The integration of qualitative and quantitative data complemented by participation of PRPs enhances the face validity of outcome research Ensuring representativeness of the patient perspective for diagnosis disease severity and cultural and geographical diversity is still challenging Introduction There is a growing trend in healthcare research to focus more on outcomes that matter to patients and more widely on research To this end the involvement of patients not just as subjects of research but as partners in the design assessment and implementation of health research is recommended and is sometimes mandatory for grant approval In the USA the Outcomes Research Institute was established in to promote research that focuses on those aspects of health that are most meaningful and important to patients PCORI involves patients at critical stages of the research process to ensure that the questions being asked are relevant and the results are meaningful to people living with a given health condition In Canada a unique study explored perspectives of people with osteoarthritis with full involvement of patients in all research phases In the context of the Innovative Medicine Initiative the European Union in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry has initiated the European Academy on Therapeutic Innovation to promote the education and active involvement of patients in health research Internationally the Cochrane Collaboration involves patients in the development of systematic reviews The UK has the longest tradition of public and patient involvement through a National Institute of Health Research program called Involve Within the specialty of rheumatology the European League Against Rheumatism Outcome Measures in Rheumatology an international consensus effort and its member working parties the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis and the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society have gained experience and published regarding active involvement of patients in their main activities In the past years EULAR and the American College of Rheumatology have included patient representatives in their guideline development and other initiatives In several European countries arthritis patient organizations have established networks of trained research partners Although patient engagement in research is promoted it is often limited to evaluating research proposals for funding or participating in advocacy groups However patients can contribute to research in different roles not only as respondents or study participants but also as advocates advisors reviewers or research partners When referring to higher levels of engagement involving close collaboration in the research process itself we use the term research A PRP is someone living with the relevant disease or condition who participates as an active team member on an equal basis with professional researchers adding the benefit of his her experiential knowledge to research projects There is limited guidance on how patient involvement in research can be achieved and few case studies to illustrate its success Fig The empirical research circle potential patient contributions and potential patient roles in research Phases of the empirical research circle are in blue examples of potential patient contributions are in orange and five potential patient roles in research are in black The role of patient research partner and patient advisor are applicable throughout the research circle The role of patient reviewer is particularly relevant in the phase of assessing grant applications often used by research funding bodies The roles of patient respondent or patient participant mostly relate to the phase of data collection The role of patient advocate is generally beneficial in the phases of fundraising establishing supportive legislation for medical research and dissemination OMERACT an independent international organization of health professionals epidemiologists outcomes researchers pharmaceutical representatives and patients has engaged PRPs consistently and increasingly over a period of years The involvement of patients has been rewarding for both the researchers and the patient representatives By collaborating with PRPs relevant outcomes for patients such as fatigue and have been identified and PRPs have reported increased knowledge and empowerment OMERACT has incrementally learned how to support promote and gain from this process Here we review how PRP involvement in OMERACT was developed supported and promoted how challenges were addressed and the benefits that have accrued Outcome Measures in Rheumatology and the Involvement of Patients The first OMERACT conference was convened at a time of actively questioning traditional but arbitrary approaches to assessing the benefits of treatment in rheumatic diseases The conference aimed to consolidate methodologically oriented approaches that had begun separately in the USA through activities within the ACR and in Europe through the World Health Organization and International League of Associations of Rheumatology One of the objectives of the first OMERACT conference was to develop consensus on the minimum number of outcome measures to be included in all rheumatoid arthritis randomized controlled trials The conference brought together rheumatologists methodologists regulatory officials and pharmaceutical industry researchers from around the world Agreement was achieved on the outcome domains that are known as the RA core set Subsequent meetings of OMERACT followed every years developing and validating specific outcome measures and developing core sets for other rheumatic diseases as proposed by Working Groups within OMERACT The basis of OMERACT is discussions with consensus through nominal group techniques In during discussions about clinically differences in outcome measures there was uncertainty whether the perspective of physicians and researchers was similar to that of patients Concluding that a representative consensus should include all three the final plenary voting session at the conference recognized that the perspective was needed and a decision was made to invite patients to the next meeting The PRPs who attended OMERACT had a limited degree of participation in the meeting They were asked to review the RA core set from the patient perspective and to identify domains that mattered to patients It became clear that the views of researchers and patients were not identical Symptoms of importance to patients such as fatigue overall and sleep disturbances were not included in the existing RA core set Also the design of clinical trials at that time would not provide patients with the information they felt was needed to judge the success of new treatments After this meeting the leadership of OMERACT and a sufficiently large proportion of those actively involved in research were convinced that PRPs should continue to be involved Since then between and patients have participated in each of the OMERACT conferences Table Characteristics of patients attending Outcome Measures in Rheumatology conferences Characteristics Gold Coast QLD

Country USA UK Australia Norway Sweden Denmark Canada The Netherlands Germany New Zealand France Malaysia Turkey Italy Proportion of all attending the conference Each meeting included patients with the rheumatologic condition featured in the program because experiential knowledge of the condition itself was felt to be critical Thirty of the PRPs have participated in at least two OMERACT conferences ten of whom have participated in at least four OMERACT conferences In recent years many more PRPs have been members of OMERACT Working Groups which carry forward the research agenda between the biannual meetings The extent to which PRPs are integrated into the OMERACT meeting program has steadily expanded As a consequence the timetable commitment for PRPs during the meeting has increased from h in to h in In parallel OMERACT has developed systems for the selection and support of PRPs with the funding and organization of their attendance being a practical challenge However developing and implementing rules and guidelines recognizing that PRPs are an essential element of all OMERACT activities has been the greatest intellectual challenge Fig Outcome measures in rheumatology conference timetabled hours designated for full participation of patient research partners in the program and for patient research partners support sessions Recognizing Patient Research Partners as an Essential Element of all OMERACT Activities Endorsement by the Leadership and Full Participation in the OMERACT Process The continuous support of the OMERACT leadership has been crucial as has the continued increase of experience and patient involvement Initiatives taken by patients such as producing the OMERACT Glossary is now part of every conference information have gradually convinced the majority of OMERACT participants that PRPs make a positive contribution Results from a recent survey of repeat OMERACT attendees concluded that working with PRPs was one of the aspects that made them return to these meetings OMERACT values the perspectives of all stakeholders and stimulates open discussions through an interactive meeting design All participants should be treated as equals and have the same opportunities to contribute to the process An introductory patient session familiarizes PRPs with the conditions under discussion at the meeting OMERACT terminology and procedures Session moderators provide patients with a subject overview and provide an environment that encourages all stakeholders but particularly patients to speak up and contribute actively in all aspects of the meeting When voting on consensus decisions PRPs have full voting rights The roles played by PRPs at and between OMERACT meetings have steadily expanded to include leading mentoring reporting small group discussions chairing plenary sessions writing reports helping to design and facilitate research between meetings securing funding and writing and editing papers Support of PRPs and the Sustainability of Participation OMERACT support for PRPs evolved as experience working together accumulated Increasing integration of patients into the program combined with the achievement of specific milestones was accompanied by greater attention to the support of PRPs Orientation and training sessions have been cumulative and written into the conference program design The increasing time demand on PRPs has resulted in the introduction of personalized programs to ensure that each PRP is able to attend the sessions most relevant to their condition Arriving day before the conference and scheduling during the meeting are included to prevent overburdening and respect disease management g time for activities of daily living resting and doing An important innovation in was the introduction of a system where new patient participants are paired with more experienced PRPs New participants found this extremely helpful Table Milestones and cumulative patient research partner

Measures in Rheumatology PRP patient research partner Facilitating PRP participation in ongoing research between meetings has been a challenge Working Group leaders have been confronted with practical issues such as providing lay summaries of documents preventing overburdening ensuring sufficient lead time for PRPs to read information and provide feedback and adequate acknowledgment of contributions In addition it is not always clear whether PRPs fulfil the criteria for authorship of publications The criteria can vary between groups to some degree influenced by the decision to be coauthor or not These processes are continually evolving Acceptance of the Role of PRPs by OMERACT Members In recommendations for the involvement of PRPs in OMERACT Working Groups were approved by an overwhelming majority at the OMERACT plenary voting session Together with the appointment of a patient delegate to the Executive Committee this demonstrates the OMERACT commitment to the principles and practice of substantive patient engagement in the research process to ensure the inclusion of that perspective as a mandatory feature of outcomes research This point was arrived at in a stepwise process with many OMERACT participants gradually changing their views on contributions and realizing the value they can add to the research process These developments can be summarized in the observation that increasing experience of working with PRPs has the greatest influence on perceptions Organizing the Attendance of PRPs Recruitment Selection and Representativeness of PRPs Potential OMERACT PRPs are first approached by a member of a Working Group usually a physician Minimum requirements include being diagnosed with the condition being studied and the ability to speak English articulate the lived experience with the disease and travel abroad and participate in an intense OMERACT working conference The patient stream leader who is one of the members of the Executive Committee approves nominations and invites PRPs to attend the conference OMERACT aims at an adequate representation of continents sexes conditions and experiences appropriate to each conference program Ensuring appropriate representativeness of PRPs has been an ongoing challenge Detailed characteristics have not been systematically collected but the majority of OMERACT PRPs have been white and higher educated Attempts have been made to broaden the diversity of the OMERACT PRPs such as finding participants from Malaysia when the meeting was held there but it is difficult to involve patients from countries where participatory research is less recognized and relationships are traditionally more paternalistic Nevertheless the countries of residence of the PRPs are similar to those of the rest of the participants in OMERACT as is the proportion residing in the USA Europe and elsewhere and respectively for PRPs compared with and for other Patients and their treating physician are often both involved in OMERACT research requiring a separation of roles of patient doctor in the clinic from that of collaborative partners at OMERACT To facilitate this each OMERACT meeting has a designated consultant physician available for patients if they have health concerns OMERACT expects PRPs to represent their personal perspective of living with the disease not that of a particular group of patients Guidelines have been developed to help PRPs and researchers focus on the personal lived experience rather than personal agendas or organizational advocacy Resources for Participation Patient participation in research and in particular at conferences requires financial resources The cost of each PRP attending OMERACT have been met by OMERACT funds or donations organized by Working Groups These expenses have been considerable and accommodating patients with severe disabilities may require special transportation arrangements g supplemental oxygen on flights personal assistance or special travel The average cost per patient has been similar for almost all the total cost for patient attendance for each of the last three meetings has been approximately per meeting values after correction for US This is a considerable portion of the central funds available to OMERACT and represents a major fundraising commitment by the OMERACT Executive Committee Challenges and Benefits Demonstrating the Impact of PRPs There is evidence that engaging patients structurally in outcomes research provides benefits for the overall research process questions opinions and concerns provided face validity to the OMERACT process and widened the research agenda New domains including fatigue foot problems stiffness definition work productivity and flares were identified by patients and prompted new research The involvement of PRPs enhanced the inclusion of outcomes in core sets It changed the culture of OMERACT and may influence practice in other disciplines and research contexts At the individual level PRPs reported in feeling more empowered towards their own disease they appreciated opportunities to contribute to the greater community and felt better able to keep abreast of research developments related to their disease In the OMERACT survey Working Group leaders valued the feedback as a reality check of the relevance and quality of their project and stated that the feedback influenced the choice of appropriate outcomes and instruments Interestingly patients were less certain about the added value of their experiential knowledge to the overall research This confirms earlier findings that patients tend to underestimate their contribution to the research process Risk of Almost half of OMERACT PRPs have attended two or more OMERACT conferences and some are highly involved in other ongoing research projects As these patient participants have become more experienced some researchers have welcomed their increased familiarity with research processes and vocabulary However others have questioned the authenticity of their patient perspective because they felt training and support over a long period of time could result in who are not able to represent the or patient perspective and therefore do not represent patients Whether this is true is open to debate but OMERACT minimizes this risk by ensuring a mixture of new and more experienced PRPs at meetings and by focusing education on the ability of PRPs to articulate their personal experience in the context of outcome research Extent of Patient Participation Between Meetings A internal OMERACT survey showed that of Working Group leaders reported patient involvement between conferences usually including at least two PRPs Involvement included regular electronic communications teleconferences and meetings where possible The survey revealed differences between researchers and PRPs in their perception of the role played by PRPs Most PRPs perceived themselves as or four viewed themselves as collaborators and one PRP reported a leadership role In contrast Working Group leaders perceived that PRPs had higher levels of involvement ten Working Group leaders viewed PRPs as in their projects and two Working Group leaders mentioned the role as being This disparity might be explained by the varying maturity of Working Groups in regards to their activities and the tendency of PRPs to underestimate the influence of their participation PRPs in Different Types of Projects There remains some debate as to whether the appropriate extent of patient participation may depend on the particular research project Although OMERACT recommends involvement of patients as PRPs throughout the research process in reality this is not always feasible Some patients provide valuable input into one or more research phases not as a PRP but as a patient advisor For example in a study to develop or evaluate a new imaging modality it may be argued that perspectives are not as necessary for the assessment of the measurement algorithms or scoring method However it would be appropriate for patients to comment on the burden safety and feasibility of a test and to understand how the results could be used in guiding their care Examples of PRPs in Working Groups A detailed analysis of the consequences of PRP involvement in OMERACT has been published Here we showcase two working groups that substantively engaged patients in all their activities After patients identified fatigue as an often ignored and disease symptom the OMERACT Fatigue Working Group initiated a research agenda with studies at different centers to systematically explore the phenomenon of fatigue The Working Group looked at its severity and evaluated existing measurement instruments and are developing new ones Patients have been involved on different levels and in different roles In the development of a new outcome measure for fatigue patients played a pivotal role in focus group meetings individual interviews surveys clinical trials cognitive interviews as well as in the OMERACT Working Group The result has been a new instrument the Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue questionnaire which is based on the conceptual framework developed from qualitative studies ensuring its face validity New data on the impact and measurement of fatigue have resulted in the recommendation to measure fatigue in clinical trials and in clinical care to reconcile disparities between physician and patient assessments of disease activity The OMERACT RA Flare Working Group involved patients from its initiation through every stage of the project Since the inception of the project in the role of PRPs has been intense and diverse Tasks were related to developing the design of the study focus group meetings and coding and analyzing transcripts PRPs participated in international teleconferences to discuss the development of an instrument to measure flares and a patient committee held additional meetings and teleconferences with other group leaders for feedback and discussion of research progress and interim findings This work is ongoing Discussion The way patients are involved as research partners in OMERACT has grown from an initial tightly circumscribed and experimental arrangement in to complete involvement at all levels of activity supported by an inclusive and supportive code of practice approved by the membership in During this time OMERACT has successfully introduced a number of conceptual structural and practical processes to ensure the integration of the patient perspective and substantive engagement throughout outcome measure development These have centered on recognizing PRPs as an essential element of all OMERACT activities and funding and organizing the attendance of PRPs Initial leadership commitment to providing resources for participation and a structure for the recruitment selection and support of PRPs was crucial The experience of working with PRPs led to a stepwise acceptance and then encouragement of the role by OMERACT members and has resulted in increased PRP engagement in Working Group activities between OMERACT meetings This approach can be applied by other societies and research groups and may result in the development of different structural and procedural changes to ensure that PRPs are supported and productive in that setting PRP inclusion in the OMERACT process is not intended to represent the perspective of all patients as they only represent themselves and their experiences However having two patients within a Working Group whatever their background and experience is infinitely better than not involving patients at all Ensuring a more representative view may be achieved through the use of mixed research methods that include qualitative interviews focus groups Delphi methods or surveys to expand the input across a wider spectrum of patients Such methods are increasingly recognized as an essential requisite of outcomes research in identifying and defining the concept of measurement g what you are seeking to grounded in the patient experience and to ensure that the ultimate measure is reflective of this concept While many have advocated increased participation in research developing metrics to demonstrate the added value of such inclusion is challenging In this report we provide not only experiential evidence from the perspectives of patients and researchers but real evidence of change in the direction of research endeavors and more detailed analyses are available The recognition of fatigue as an important aspect of living with RA has now been incorporated into recommendations for patient assessments in clinical care and for clinical trials though the optimal measure has yet to be defined There are few publications that have described methods of successful engagement in detail and further studies are needed to provide additional evidence of the benefits and impact of patient participation While the work reported here has been limited to rheumatology the conceptual foundations and the framework developed for patient inclusion are widely applicable across all chronic diseases and beyond outcomes research EULAR now recommends involvement of PRPs throughout the research process preferably from the beginning PCORI has also recently developed a rubric for patient and stakeholder engagement that provides examples of how patients can be involved at different phases of research The US Food Drug Administration Critical Path Initiative the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative and the International Society for Quality of Life research have also begun to integrate PRPs in their work The process explained here should be useful in other contexts and to other specialties Moving such an agenda forward is time consuming and necessitates enthusiasm and perseverance particularly to support and train patients and health professionals However OMERACT researchers value patient participation highly in conferences and this is one of the central reasons for their ongoing participation The dialogue and engagement between researchers and PRPs has greatly improved the quality of core outcome sets by ensuring that outcomes are relevant to patients Patient participation has enriched the research agendas and enhanced mutual understanding of outcomes of importance for both patients and researchers The experience of OMERACT should help move policy makers funders and researchers closer to the view that participatory research is not only a normative imperative for outcome research but is also effective in producing relevant research and health outcomes Author contributions MdeW JRK PT and LG drew together the main elements of the article All authors were then involved

physiologic homeostasis throughout life Macrophages arise from yolk sac and foetal liver progenitors during embryonic development in the mouse and persist in different organs as heterogeneous populations Bone blood monocytes are recruited after birth to replenish populations and to meet further demands during inflammation infection and metabolic perturbations Macrophages of mixed origin and different locations vary in replication and turnover but are all active in mRNA and protein synthesis fulfilling and systemic trophic functions in addition to host defence In this review we emphasise selected properties and functions of tissue macrophages which contribute to physiologic homeostasis Keywords Macrophages Homeostasis Tissue heterogeneity Physiology Receptors Phagocytosis University of Nottingham Berlin Heidelberg Introduction constancy of the internal environment is the condition for full and independent life the mechanism that makes it possible is that which assured that maintenance within the internal environment conditions necessary for the life of these The concept of homeostasis as a physiological principle a term proposed by the neuroscientist Walter Cannon and based on the work of Claude Bernard has influenced the thinking of many macrophage investigators Elie Metchnikoff a comparative zoologist who initially was intrigued by intracellular digestion in invertebrates became an experimental immunologist when he appreciated the role of phagocytes in tissue orthobiosis and inflammation Hans Selye drew attention to the adaptations of the body to biological however the contributions of the mononuclear phagocyte system to the mechanisms of homeostasis and stress responses have not achieved full recognition In this review we consider topics related to the role of macrophages in development metabolism and functions in different organs to illustrate their remarkable ability to recognise and respond to the changing needs of the body A general overview of the main topic covered is provided in Fig Fig Physiological roles of macrophages and macrophages heterogeneity Phenotypic heterogeneity of tissue macrophages is triggered by differences in cellular origin cells of embryonic origin vs tissue environment and adaptation to the physiological requirements of the organism on the left Macrophage heterogeneity underpins the vast range of physiological roles performed of these cells on the right Phenotypic heterogeneity is consolidated by in macrophages in response to environmental signals Macrophages display a wide range of in the form of cell surface and intracellular pattern recognition receptors that detect molecular patterns and molecular receptors for apoptotic cytokine receptors such as and that promote activation receptors for neurotransmitters as well as receptors that regulate macrophage activation in situ such as the inhibitory receptors and Integrins mediate interaction with extracellular matrix Macrophages produce numerous molecules that contribute to tissue remodelling and inflammation and mediate clearance of apoptotic bodies cell debris and soluble compounds such as collagen and lysosomal hydrolases High phagocytic and endocytic activities as well as motility are central to the ability of macrophages to support functions RNS reactive nitrogen species ROS reactive oxygen species Blood monocytes and tissue macrophages display many properties in common but they adapt readily upon entering different tissue microenvironments where they contribute to the general needs as well as specialised functions of individual organs Reciprocal interactions between neighbouring cells and tissue macrophages are mediated by close contacts as well as secretory products which act at close range or distally via the circulation Although primarily known as professional phagocytes which engulf dying cells during development and subsequently during adult life it has not been generally appreciated that macrophage activities extend beyond immunology and host defence They express a broad repertoire of surface and intracellular receptors and produce a large variety of regulated bioactive together with their ability to enter all tissues in the steady state and on demand they constitute a dispersed organ system able to influence and respond to every other system in the body Cellular characteristics of the macrophage lineage relevance to physiology To set the stage for subsequent discussion we briefly summarise some general properties of macrophages relevant to their functions in vivo The cells originate from progenitors in the embryo and postnatally as discussed further below and are seeded throughout the body as relatively long lived terminally differentiated haematopoietic cells They are motile and display a range of membrane receptors to recognise and respond to a large repertoire of and foreign ligands These include adhesion molecules opsonic and receptors to mediate phagocytic clearance of particulates including and apoptotic cells and for endocytosis of soluble ligands In addition they are able to sense and respond to the presence of microbial constituents including RNA and DNA within their cytoplasm activating intracellular inflammasomes caspase processing and release of A plethora of other cytokines enzymes growth factors and low molecular metabolite products can also be secreted by macrophages in response to phagocytic and various stimuli and in turn act on macrophage receptors by autocrine mechanisms Plasma membrane receptors in formation of a phagocytic synapse excluding phosphatases such as and allow receptor kinases to initiate signalling pathways and cytoskeletal assembly to bring about ingestion of particles A sequence of dynamic interactions with vesicular membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus accompanies phagosome maturation fusion with primary lysosomes acidification and digestion Macrophages can internalise its entire surface membrane in min but recycle components equally rapidly to maintain membrane homeostasis Heterophagy refers to uptake of extracellular autophagy the sequestration of effete cytoplasm and intracellular organelles is well developed in macrophages genetic deficiency of lysosomal digestion or components of the autophagy pathway can result in storage diseases or chronic granulomatous inflammation respectively The uptake and killing of microbes and opsonised cellular targets by oxygen and radicals are mediated by assembly and activation of an NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthetase respectively The ingestion of apoptotic targets a major physiologic function of and inflammatory macrophages is mediated by a range of redundant receptors using exposed phosphatidyl serine and other cues as ligands Apoptotic cell uptake inhibits the inflammatory response associated with uptake of necrotic cells or products include and The importance of phagoptotic killing during phagocytosis has been emphasised by the studies of Guy Brown and colleagues Finally macrophages can ingest nuclei or intracellular vesicles released from living cells or undergo cell fusion to form multinucleated giant cells Phenotypic adaptation of macrophages Macrophage gene expression has been intensively studied in recent years and modules of genes regulated by a range of cytokines and other stimuli characterised in and inflammatory macrophages Both and pathways can be induced in macrophage populations mediated by plasma membrane or cytoplasmic receptors for example induces a characteristic profile of genes and proteins often termed or prototypic markers include upregulation of MHCII antigens cytokines and induction of whereas expression is selectively downregulated By contrast and binding to a common receptor alpha chain induce an phenotype characterised by upregulation of transglutaminase arginase and in the mouse molecules such as An receptor pathway has also been demonstrated by induction of macrophage homokaryon formation Phenotypic changes in macrophages are underpinned by metabolic reprogramming macrophages utilise Warburg metabolism and macrophage oxidative metabolism The terminology arose as counterpart to and categories of adaptive immune responses associated with the above and related cytokines It is thought that instead of bimodal polarisation a more complex phenotypic spectrum is more likely especially in vivo In truth there is overlap with other stimuli e g after stimulation or immune complex activation The stability or reversibility of phenotype in vivo needs a great deal of further study at population and the single cell level In addition further studies on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms will contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of and generic macrophage phenotypic heterogeneity Macrophage heterogeneity under physiological conditions The immune system comprises a complex network of cellular and soluble components that collaborate to respond to challenges both infectious and identified as potential threats to the organism Accordingly immune constituents are widely distributed throughout tissues with specialised lymphoid organs such as splenic white pulp and lymph nodes mostly providing unique sites for the induction of specific acquired immunity To date newcomers to the field are still surprised to learn that healthy tissues incorporate immune cells in particular macrophages which are cells commonly associated with protection against infection and as mediators of tissue damage Macrophages unlike neutrophils are integral components of they contribute to organ development and maintenance of homeostasis through mechanisms similar to those exploited during infection to detect pathogens and trigger inflammation Widespread distribution of macrophages is accompanied by substantial phenotypic and gene expression profile differences related to the specific environmental cues in each organ that foster macrophage function Differences in gene expression are underpinned by the existence of distinct in each tissue macrophage population which are determined in large extent by the tissue environment Furthermore fully differentiated macrophages may retain the capacity to change their gene expression profile when exposed to a new tissue environment which highlights the potential ability of macrophages to undergo reprogramming even after differentiation Phenotypically there are instances of tissue adaptation in macrophages involving fine tuning of cellular activation thresholds In mucosal tissues such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts macrophages display a higher threshold of activation as a means to minimise organ damage in response to repeated exposure to foreign material including microbial products In the case of alveolar macrophages exposure to surfactant proteins A and D and close interaction with respiratory epithelium through the inhibitory receptor and tethered act as effective brakes of macrophage activation minimising the risk of unwanted inflammation In the gut macrophages are hyporesponsive to stimulation Nevertheless gut macrophages can trigger inflammation with one mechanism involving the detection of tissue damage through activation of the inflammasome which induces processing of constitutively expressed by intestinal macrophages This mechanism ensures detection of pathogens that cause tissue damage through the production of virulence factors Macrophages in internal organs less exposed to microbial constituents present a lower activation threshold and are considered to be responsible for the induction of systemic inflammation in response to pathogens which can have deadly consequences in the case of sepsis Origin of tissue macrophages In addition to environmental cues characteristics in macrophages can be linked in part to on site differentiation of macrophages from embryonic precursors during development and maintenance of macrophage numbers in tissues through with imprinting of macrophage transcriptional programmes by tissue factors of particular importance Indeed the original idea of monocytes as precursors of tissue macrophages that gave rise to the concept of mononuclear phagocyte proposed by van Furth et al has been questioned by recent studies demonstrating that in many anatomical sites tissue macrophages originate from precursors derived from the yolk sac during early embryogenesis with a second wave of embryonic precursors derived from foetal liver This embryonic origin contrasts with the bone marrow origin for most immune cells Definitive haematopoiesis takes place in the bone marrow after birth These findings were accompanied by the identification in the mouse of two populations of circulating monocytes classical hi monocytes that originate directly from precursors and low monocytes that derive from high monocytes through the action of the transcription factor Further monocytes are now perceived to be not just transitional cells on their way to some authors refer to circulating lo monocytes as involved in the maintenance of the integrity of the endothelial barrier high monocytes contribute to replenishment of tissue macrophages with the rate of replenishment varying among anatomical sites In the steady state tissue macrophages are almost in the case of brain as microglia are derived from yolk sac precursors Similar scenarios have been observed in the case of Langerhans cells in the epidermis alveolar macrophages in the lung and Kupffer cells in the liver resident macrophages are more prevalent in the heart and pancreas display a slow replacement and gut and dermis display a higher replacement high monocytes are recruited to tissues under steady state and inflammatory conditions In the absence of inflammation high monocytes sample the tissues and transport material to draining lymph nodes without differentiating into macrophages or dendritic cells Under inflammatory conditions high monocytes differentiate into macrophages and can give rise to tissue macrophages with capacity for This process is highly dependent on the strategy used and the organ under consideration Role of macrophages in development Osteoclasts and bone remodelling Bone remodelling occurs throughout life and is influenced by physical activity diet and hormones Bone generation promoted by cells of mesenchymal origin termed osteoblasts is balanced by the action of cells of haematopoietic origin termed osteoclasts that mediate bone reabsorption Bone formation and degradation need to be balanced as disequilibrium would lead to osteoporosis of bone or osteopetrosis bone Further bone remodelling controls Ca fluxes into and from the extracellular fluid which is required for the maintenance of the levels of calcium in blood Osteoclasts belong to the myeloid lineage are and are multinucleated Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on receptor activator of ligands Osteoclasts attach to the bone surface and assume a polarised morphology The area attached to the bone is sealed bone is degraded by the release of acid and acidic collagenolytic enzymes and released material is secreted at the opposite side of the cell through transcytosis Exchange of signals between osteoblasts and osteoclasts ensures that bone remodelling is regulated For instance osteoblast apoptosis upon bone damage promotes osteoclast recruitment to the bone surface and RANKL is essential for osteoclast differentiation produced by osteoblasts inhibits osteoclast formation Similarly osteoclasts influence osteoblast function through the production of and semaphorin which promote and inhibit bone formation respectively As a consequence of lack of bone resorption bone marrow haematopoiesis does not occur due to lack of its anatomical niche animals develop osteopetrosis and survive to adulthood because of extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen and liver and generation of osteoclasts takes place by compensatory expression of VEGF Osteoclast generation enables the establishment of bone marrow haematopoiesis by enabling the creation of the haematopoietic niche Remodelling deficiencies in the absence of macrophages have been observed in mammary glands kidney and pancreas which suggest an important role in this can be due to the contribution of macrophages to extracellular matrix remodelling and a role in maintenance of the viability and function of stem cells as observed in mammary glands and liver Macrophages and erythropoiesis Definitive erythropoiesis occurs in the bone in particular terminal erythropoiesis takes place in erythroblastic islands where tight clusters can be found between erythroid precursors with a central macrophage Molecules implicated in the interaction between erythroid precursors and macrophages include the erythroblast macrophage protein the receptor on erythroblasts and on macrophages and on erythroblasts and integrin on macrophages Erythroblastic islands have also been found in areas of definitive haematopoiesis such as foetal liver and splenic red pulp Macrophages have been shown to promote erythropoiesis through the release of ferritin by exocytosis which is internalised by erythroblasts where iron is released through acidification and proteolysis factors associated with chronic inflammation such as and inhibit erythropoiesis Erythropoiesis is completely dependent on the phagocytic activity of macrophages Macrophages phagocytose extruded erythrocyte nuclei which are released during the final phase of erythrocyte differentiation This is possible through the maintenance of adhesion molecules such as Emp and integrin and exposure of phosphatidyl serine at the surface of the nuclei Macrophages and brain development Microglia constitute the resident macrophage population in the brain and spinal cord and are yolk In addition to responding to tissue injury ramified microglia have been shown to contribute to synaptic maturation during brain development This process is termed and involves the clearance of immature or defective neuronal synapses microglia dysfunction is now considered a major cause of neuropsychiatric or neurological disorders as exemplified by the link between mutations in the gene encoding to hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids Loss of function mutations in a receptor expressed by microglia in the CNS have been associated with increased risk of developing disease Microglia protect against extension of amyloid fibrils by wrapping around plaques and deficiency has been shown to disrupt this process Macrophages and lung homeostasis Alveoli are lined by the alveolar epithelium which is mainly composed of type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells Type I epithelial cells cover of the alveoli surface while type II epithelial cells are less abundant and mediate the synthesis secretion and recycling of lung surfactant Alveolar surfactant is composed of lipids and proteins and keeps alveoli open by reducing surface tension during breathing Alveolar macrophages reside in the alveoli and establish close interactions with alveolar epithelial cells some of which involve interactions such as and as inhibitory receptors Surfactant proteins A and D also contribute to inhibition of cellular activation in alveolar macrophages by engaging Alveolar macrophages are derived from embryonically derived foetal monocytes soon after birth through a process highly dependent on They replicate in situ and thus are independent from monocyte input in most instances Alveolar macrophages mediate of surfactant lipid metabolism which explains the development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in mice and in mice lacking the ABC transporters or peroxisome receptor gamma which display inefficient surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages These same genes are involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport by circulating monocytes and their deficiency has been linked to the development of atherosclerosis Macrophages and metabolism Macrophages and metabolic syndrome The involvement of macrophages in metabolic homeostasis was highlighted by major changes in macrophage numbers to of stromal and phenotype from alternative activation to classical in white adipose tissue in obese animals and humans These changes have also been observed in other metabolic tissues liver and muscle which implies a strong functional link between macrophage phenotype and parameters of tissue homeostasis This is in agreement with macrophages contributing actively to maintenance of tissue homeostasis but also acting as sensors of tissue dysfunction and promoters of inflammation in the absence of infection In the case of the metabolic syndrome the central role of macrophages derives in part from the negative impact of inflammation on signalling events downstream of the insulin receptor making the cells within metabolic tissues resistant to the action of insulin This effect in turn will lead to maladaptation in glucose metabolism with increased insulin production by islet cells in the pancreas required to compensate for this effect and establishment of a state In healthy white adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in adipocytes is maintained through the action of resident macrophages that express the cytokine acting as insulin sensitiser These macrophages have a phenotype consistent with alternative activation resulting from exposure to and expression by macrophages is essential for control of alternative activation and improves insulin resistance eosinophils have been identified as the source of in adipose tissue and lack of eosinophils has been associated with activation of adipose tissue macrophages and a tendency to develop insulin resistance in response to obesity Changes in macrophage phenotype in white adipose tissue after chronic increase in energy uptake occur in response to metabolic stress in the this leads to the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes by and These inflammatory monocytes differentiate into classically activated macrophages engulf dying adipocytes and further promote cellular activation Cytokine production by these activated macrophages is considered major contributors to local and systemic insulin resistance In the case of hepatic insulin resistance Kupffer cells regulate the oxidation of fatty acids in hepatic steatosis develops if Kupffer cells are unable to adopt an alternative activation phenotype because of loss of in myeloid cells Macrophages and iron recycling Resident bone marrow macrophages and red pulp macrophages are essential for the process of erythrophagocytosis to recycle iron Senescent or damaged erythrocytes are phagocytosed and digested to extract heme Upon uptake heme is degraded through the action of heme oxygenase predominantly to release iron into the cytoplasm Cytoplasmic iron is exported by ferroportin located at the plasma membrane Iron flux from macrophages exceeds iron adsorption through diet and iron stored in hepatocytes Intriguingly heme itself has been shown to induce the development of hi VCAM hi iron recycling macrophages in bone marrow and spleen through induction of the transcription factor Red pulp macrophages also express and the receptor which further emphasises their important role in systemic iron haemostasis There are several hypotheses regarding the signals recognised on aged erythrocytes by macrophages for their removal These signals include the exposure of the universal apoptotic marker phosphatidyl serine in senescent erythrocytes in spite of the fact that erythrocytes lack a cell nucleus and mitochondria and do not undergo canonical apoptotic process Other possibilities include the loss of expression i e lack of an inhibitory signal and conformational changes in that enable an interaction between and which results in increased uptake by red pulp macrophages Splenic macrophages have also been implicated in the removal of intracellular inclusions in erythrocytes through a process that leaves the erythrocyte intact These inclusion bodies are thought to be caused by oxidative damage Macrophages and tissue regeneration inflammation with preservation of organ function depends on multifaceted interactions between macrophages and recruited immune cells particularly neutrophils and monocytes that ensure timely resolution through changes in the activation state of macrophages a to a These constitute a mediator class which shifts the production of lipid mediators from instance the eicosanoids prostaglandin and leukotriene that promote vasodilatation and to lipids as lipoxins resolvins protectins and production of proteins such as annexin gaseous mediators chemokine inactivation and release of acetylcholine by the vagus nerve Resident macrophages dominate the induction of inflammatory responses in response to injury in the presence and absence of infection through activation of receptors by DAMPs and MAMPs After stimulation macrophages produce an array of cytokines such as and and chemokines as well as eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid an fatty acid Vasodilation and edema are followed by recruitment of neutrophils which are the first cells that enter the inflamed site Neutrophil recruitment is favoured by the rapid exposure of on activated endothelial cells followed by engagement of integrins by the adhesion molecules and culminating in the process of diapedesis Cues for directional cell migration are provided by the formation of chemokine gradients that guide the migrating neutrophil to the site of injury Resolution of inflammation is now viewed as an active process and its can hamper restoration of tissue function with lack of resolution leading to chronic inflammation and scar formation and fibrosis The collaborative nature of the resolution process is illustrated by the requirement for transcellular metabolic events between leukocytes and epithelial cells and platelets for the synthesis of lipoxins the first described lipids Because of their potential for tissue damage it appears counterintuitive to consider essential partners for the resolution of inflammation However neutrophils promote resolution by enhancing monocyte recruitment by inducing changes in endothelial cells for instance through shedding of which complexes with The complex engages on endothelial cells and induces the production of and thus promoting monocyte recruitment In addition apoptotic neutrophils change macrophage activation as uptake of apoptotic neutrophils is inducing and lipoxin synthesis by macrophages These changes are associated with the sensing of an established early during the induction phase and highly dependent on the nature and extent of the original insult Molecular mechanisms underpinning this concept include the fact that prostaglandin induces changes in the lipoxygenase activity of neutrophils from to required for synthesis of lipoxins During cardiac damage inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes release that induces the release by cardiomyocytes of promotes the recruitment of reparative macrophages which favours the elimination of neutrophils In addition macrophages control the neutrophil lifespan through the release of Fas ligand and TRAIL The fate of the recruited monocytes and their contribution to repair depends on the organ and extent of damage In the heart recruited monocytes give rise to macrophages while resident macrophages mediate tissue repair In the spinal cord both the and repair macrophages are While the macrophages derive from monocytes recruited through the pathway macrophages derived from monocytes are recruited through a pathway involving and In other scenarios recruited monocytes have been shown to convert from an initial phenotype to a healing phenotype consistent with plasticity of myeloid cells This scenario has been observed in kidney and muscle A key aspect during tissue regeneration and repair is the between macrophages and stem cells For instance in liver macrophage depletion has been shown to reduce invasiveness of liver progenitor cells into the parenchyma which is required for differentiation into hepatocytes In addition macrophages can be induced to produce after uptake of hepatic debris promotes expression of Numb in liver progenitor cells which inhibits Notch and promotes differentiation into hepatocytes instead of biliary cells Macrophages contribute to muscle regeneration with the sequential change from an early phenotype into a phenotype essential for this process Disruption of these changes in the phenotype of macrophages by blocking early inflammation with or blocking or late resolution with compromises muscle regeneration Myogenic precursor cells are stimulated to migrate grow and survive by macrophages with cells stimulating proliferation and inhibiting fusion and macrophages stimulating commitment of myogenic precursors and differentiation to form myotubes In kidney macrophages have been found to produce which promotes repair of basement membrane Scar formation during wound healing can compromise organ function after injury and multiple reports have linked immunity to the regulation of tissue fibrosis although the molecular processes of this effect are poorly understood Knipper et al recently revealed an important between macrophages and fibroblasts during wound healing in mouse injured skin required to control the formation of collagen fibrils This effect is dependent on the expression of by myeloid cells which among others induces the production of a marker of macrophage activation in response to signalling during wound healing promotes the expression of by macrophages and in turn induces the synthesis of the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase by fibroblasts leading to fibrosis In line with the major influence of the tissue environment on macrophage biology in liver and muscle immunity promotes tissue regeneration through direct action on parenchymal cells this suggests that macrophage contribution to wound healing is largely dependent on the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the tissue and likely the nature of the insult Macrophages and thermogenesis Brown fat termed brown adipose tissue generates heat and plays an important role in maintaining body temperature In contrast to white adipocytes brown adipocytes contain multilocular fat droplets a large number of mitochondria and express high levels of protein is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and uncouples electron transport to promote heat instead of ATP in brown adipocytes In humans brown adipose tissue was thought to be restricted to neonates but recent data have shown the presence of brown fat in adults Adult human brown fat is dispersed in the supraclavicular and suprarenal regions is and shares many characteristic with the beige fat found in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue of rodents Beige fat refers to the presence of white adipocytes functionally similar to brown adipocytes within white fat and promotion of beige fat formation is considered as a potential therapeutic tool in the fight against obesity Macrophages have been shown to be essential for adaptation to cold exposure that leads to lipolysis in white fat and thermogenesis in brown fat The effect of macrophages depends on the acquisition of an alternative activated phenotype driven by and and that leads to secretion of catecholamines by these cells Indeed exposure of macrophages induces production of the three enzymes required for catecholamine production tyrosine hydroxylase dopa decarboxylase and dopamine the agonist was able to rescue the thermogenic defect in animals unable to produce and In agreement with these findings in mice oral administration of the receptor agonist mirabegron can stimulate human brown fat thermogenesis in humans Macrophages together with eosinophils and cytokines have also been implicated in the remodelling of subcutaneous white fat into beige fat in mice Conclusion and therapeutic opportunities Macrophages are remarkable for their ability to sense their surroundings produce a wide range of immune mediators alongside growth factors and opsonins and their endocytic and phagocytic activity The recognition of macrophages as intrinsic components of organs adapted to the particular tissue environment and actively involved in homeostatic processes opens the opportunity for therapies that can be exploited to steer pathological processes towards outcomes that favour maintenance of organ function Furthermore the potential plasticity shown by these cells makes it possible to envisage the possibility of using in cells to treat disease by adoptive transfer This article is part of the

and facilitating effects on memory intoxication can lead to poor memory for information encoded after alcohol consumption and may improve memory for information encoded before consumption This study examined whether alcohol consumed after witnessing a crime can render individuals less vulnerable to misleading information Method Participants watched a simulated crime video Thereafter one third of participants expected and received alcohol one third did not expect but received alcohol and one third did not expect nor receive alcohol After alcohol consumption participants were exposed to misinformation embedded in a written narrative about the crime The following day participants completed a questionnaire about the event Results Control participants were more likely to report misinformation compared to the alcohol and reverse placebo group Conclusion The findings suggest that we may oversimplify the effect alcohol has on suggestibility and that sometimes alcohol can have beneficial effects on eyewitness memory by protecting against misleading information Keywords Eyewitness memory Suggestibility Alcohol Retrograde facilitation Interference Glasgow Caledonian University Berlin Heidelberg According to the British Crime Survey from and of violent incidents were and of those occurred in pubs bars and clubs where alcohol is sold and consumed for National Statistics Evans et al note that many witnesses are intoxicated either at the time of a crime when interviewed or both Given these numbers studies have explored the effects of alcohol on various aspects of eyewitness memory including free recall cued recall and performance with generally detrimental et al Dysart et al Van Oorsouw and Merckelbach Yuille and Tollestrup or null effects of alcohol consumption on memory et al Harvey et al Schreiber Compo et al It should be noted that some of these studies obtained fairly low levels of intoxication with their participants and probably underestimated the detrimental effect of alcohol on memory performance Amongst laboratory studies the highest peak BAC was et al and the smallest peak BAC was et al Low peak BACs ranged from to et al Harvey et al In field studies by Van Oorsouw and Merckelbach and Van Oorsouw et al slightly higher peak BACs of and were obtained It could be argued that negative effects of alcohol on eyewitness memory performance might be even more pronounced when higher intoxication levels are present however due to ethical reasons this is often not achievable in laboratory studies Recent research for example by Crossland et al Hagsand et al Van Oorsouw and Merckelbach and Van Oorsouw et al have managed to reach higher BAC levels which should not be underestimated Only a few studies to date have examined the relationship between alcohol and suggestibility et al Schreiber Compo et al Van Oorsouw et al Suggestibility in eyewitnesses is the remembering or reporting of erroneous details about an event either in response to incorrectly leading questions immediate or through exposure to incorrect information about the event that is later recalled delayed and Gudjonsson Schooler and Loftus For example Van Oorsouw et al approached sober M BAC SD moderately intoxicated between and M BAC SD or severely intoxicated M BAC SD participants drinking in a bar and required them to commit a mock crime In subsequent interviews included incorrectly leading those who were severely intoxicated were more suggestible to the leading questions than those who were sober Conversely Schreiber Compo et al using a delayed rather than immediate suggestibility paradigm in a laboratory environment found no difference between intoxicated M BAC SD placebo and control participants on the level of suggestibility Importantly in both studies participants were intoxicated before witnessing the crime Santtila et al explored the effect of alcohol on immediate suggestibility using the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale Gudjonsson Participants received a high ml of alcohol per kg of body medium ml of alcohol per kg of body or low dose of alcohol ml of alcohol per kg of body or a placebo drink No BAC readings were taken after alcohol administration Alcohol when administered after the narrative appeared to protect participants from the negative effect of incorrectly leading questions There was no effect when these questions were repeated following negative feedback Santtila et al argued that individual differences in emotions g anger and and personality g acquiescence and might be responsible for decreased suggestibility scores before negative feedback However personality and emotions did not moderate the effects of alcohol on suggestibility These findings may reflect what Wixted called the phenomenon of retrograde Retrograde facilitation refers to memories being enhanced if they are formed prior to intoxication One explanation for this twisted effect is that alcohol protects already formed memories by reducing new memory formation That alcohol and benzodiazepines if consumed prior to learning can induce temporary anterograde amnesia to a point where individuals do not remember anything at well known Wetherill and Fromme for a However these drugs may have a positive effect on memories formed prior to consumption by protecting them against any new incoming information thereby reducing retrograde interference It could be argued that this protective function may therefore lead to improved memory even in the absence of a direct interference task by reducing nonspecific interference and thereby protecting still fragile recently formed memories Evidence for this approach comes from several psychological experiments For example Parker et al tested memory for scenic slides and found that having had alcohol peak BAC after learning significantly improved recognition performance Similarly Moulton et al found that although memory for prose learned while participants were intoxicated peak BAC was poor compared to sober controls the opposite was found for prose learned prior to intoxication The diphasic effect of alcohol on memory performance has been found with emotional and Pihl M BAC neutral and stimuli et al b peak BAC Thus alcohol seems to impair subsequent recall of information encoded when intoxicated but facilitates recall of material encountered prior to intoxication due to minimizing general new memory formation The diphasic effect of alcohol on memory performance could have important implications for forensic settings That is alcohol may not always render witnesses and victims to crime less reliable but it depends on the timing of the incident and the alcohol consumption For example an individual might observe something in a club or pub prior to consuming any alcohol and not realize that this will later form a crucial detail during a criminal investigation Oblivious to the fact that he she will become a witness the individual might then consume alcohol during the remaining course of the evening It could be argued that in such a scenario this witness will be less susceptible to the incorporation of misinformation than an individual who remained sober The present study used a delayed misinformation paradigm to explore the effects of alcohol administered after a witnessed event but prior to exposure to misleading information The misinformation paradigm is a popular task to study false memories and suggestibility and findings have important implications for situations such as eyewitness testimony and investigative interviewing For instance Loftus et al found that information presented after an event can influence memory for that event In a series of experiments depicting an accident participants who had initially seen a stop sign later reported having seen a yield sign after having been exposed to misleading information Since then the misinformation effect has been examined with various stimuli and under a variety of conditions and researchers were even able to induce very rich false memories such as having attended a hospital appointment et al or committing a crime and Porter Loftus for a In the present experiment alcohol was administered after witnessing a crime but prior to the presentation of misinformation Cued recall was used to test suggestibility h later when participants were sober again To enable us to separate the physiological and psychological expectancy effects of alcohol on suggestibility a reverse placebo treatment condition were told they would not receive alcohol when in fact they was included This is fundamental given the significant body of work demonstrating that expectancies can influence different behaviors and cognitions and Albery such as impulsivity et al sexual risk taking et al et al motor performance and and speed of processing et al even in the absence of alcohol consumption Method Participants and design participants and staff from London South Bank females aged to years M SD took part in the study One participant did not return to the second session Participants either received course credits or a small monetary reward for their participation Each individual completed a comprehensive screening process to establish their eligibility to participate Age weight height previous drinking history and any medical conditions were established to ensure it was safe for them to consume alcohol The experiment followed a mixed design The factor was condition alcohol control and reverse placebo The factor was item type control vs misled That is all participants were exposed to misleading and control items and had to subsequently answer questions relating to these items The study was approved by the London South Bank Ethics Committee Materials Breath alcohol measurement Breath alcohol content was measured with a Lion Alcolmeter breathalyzer This instrument was checked with an alcohol standard at regular intervals and recalibrated if required BrAC was subsequently converted into BAC alcohol with the Lion Units Converter Crime event The event was a staged crime depicting a distractor burglary The video footage showed two people a man and a woman entering a house and conducting a survey with the homeowner in the living room After a few minutes the homeowner went into the kitchen to make some tea In the mean time the woman went upstairs into a room and stole some jewelry while the man stole some money and a laptop from the living room The robbers then swiftly left the property The homeowner retuned from the kitchen and ran after the thieves after he realized that he has been robbed The event was min and s long information and memory test Pilot testing was conducted to ensure that memory for each critical detail was reasonable and the misleading suggestions were seen as plausible participants comprising of University students and staff M age SD watched the video clip and then completed a cued recall test immediately Only items that were remembered more often than and less than of the time were selected as potential critical items Next participants were presented with a test including the correct answer to the previously presented cued recall test and three alternative answers Participants were asked to circle the option that was actually presented in the video clip and to rate the plausibility of each other alternative on a to scale Items with mean plausibility ratings of were included as the misleading details This was done to ensure that misinformation items were not completely implausible and therefore directly rejected by participants Similarly it was important to ensure that misinformation items were not too plausible and therefore more likely to be accepted by participants than original items similar procedure was used by Horry et al The mean plausibility rating for misleading items was After pilot testing items of were selected as critical items The PEI was presented in a narrative Two versions of the narrative were created A and Each version included five misleading items The five misleading items for half of the participants served as control items for the other half of participants in order to give an indication of the extent to which PEI is recounted by chance Most of the control items were not mentioned in the narrative or were mentioned only in a neutral form in Horry et al For example in version A participants read the misinformation that the victim was wearing a green fleece jumper whereas in version B the victim was only described as wearing a fleece jumper in the original video footage the jumper was blue The cued recall memory test consisted of enquiring about misleading items and five about control items For example was the colour of the victims jumper or did the female perpetrator carry Underneath each question was some space for participants to provide their answer Underneath the space for the answer was a confidence rating scale ranging from very confident at to Procedure The study consisted of two sessions separated by one day Participants took part individually During the first session participants watched the staged crime video They were told to pay close attention Subsequently participants were randomly assigned to one of three alcohol and expected alcohol condition N received alcohol and did not expect alcohol were told they received Blue an placebo condition N and received no alcohol and expected no alcohol condition N gender height and weight were used to calculate the required dose with the Blood Alcohol Calculator to achieve a peak BAC of approximately All drinks were poured out of sight of the participants On being handed their beverage participants were told to consume their drink within min but no faster than min similar procedure was used in Santtila et al Participants then rinsed their mouth with water to remove residual traces of alcohol and to avoid contamination of subsequent breathalyzer readings Thereafter participants completed some filler tasks search for min to allow their BAC to rise Crossland et al Participants were then breathalyzed not informed about the If their BAC reading was below the required a further reading was taken min later It is important to note that all participants underwent the same procedure regardless of condition That is all participants had to consume the beverage in the time and all participants were subsequently breathalyzed after a delay at least once All participants were then presented with one of two versions of the narrative To ensure that the information was being processed the narrative was presented on six different cards in a randomly scrambled order Participants were told that they would engage in a comprehension task and that they had to read the cards carefully and subsequently sort them in chronological order procedure was adopted from Horry et al Finally participants were asked to read out aloud the sorted narrative cards to the experimenter Following the comprehension task participants were informed about the actual nature of their drink and released from the first session Those displaying BACs above UK were advised to remain in the lab until their BAC reduced to below Those who did not wish to stay behind had to sign a waiver form confirming their awareness of being in excess of the UK drink and drive alcohol limit The second session commenced the following day All participants completed the memory test in their own time They were instructed to think back to the film they watched and for every question to write down what they remember having seen in the film They were told that the narrative they read during the comprehension task contained some incorrect details They were instructed to provide a response to every question If they could not remember they were asked to guess After each question participants were asked to rate the confidence in their answer on a scale ranging from confident at to After having answered all questions participants were asked to go back through their answers and to indicate for each whether they would be willing to testify to it in a court of law With this in mind participants went through their answers and indicated with a next to the answer that they would testify to it or with a next to it that they would withhold the answer g Horry et al Finally participants were debriefed thanked for their participation and dismissed Results Blood alcohol concentrations In line with previous research all BrACs were converted to BACs with the blood breath ratio of For the two groups who consumed alcohol e alcohol and reverse placebo the average BAC was BACs ranged from to All control participants had a BAC of A ANOVA revealed a significant

confidence intervals Discussion The current study was designed to examine retrograde facilitation in a delayed misinformation paradigm We are the first to show that alcohol consumption after having witnessed a criminal event can protect memory from the negative effects of misinformation Contrary to the general belief and empirical finding that alcohol impairs eyewitness memory we found that individuals who consumed alcohol and reverse placebo after the observed event but prior to encountering misleading information reported significantly fewer misinformation items on a subsequent memory test compared to the control group did not receive any A particularly worrying finding is that the sober participants were also more likely to be prepared to testify a misled response in a court of law No difference in the proportion of correct responses provided was found between groups Nor did the groups differ with regards to how confident they were in their responses A potential explanation for reduced suggestibility is that alcohol leads to decreased retrograde interference et al That is intoxication reduces the formation of new memories thereby protecting already existing memories and making them less vulnerable to interference retrograde facilitation has been demonstrated in previous studies using list of words sentences pictures and prose passages and Pihl Moulton et al Parker et al Weafer et al b Our findings demonstrate that facilitation holds true for autobiographical memories in a misinformation eyewitness paradigm Including a reverse placebo group allowed us to shed more light on expectancy and pharmacological effects of alcohol consumption on retrograde facilitation Both the alcohol and reverse placebo group were less suggestible to misinformation indicating that the facilitated memory effect is more likely to be due to the pharmacological effects of alcohol rather than due to beliefs This is in line with the findings reported by Parker et al who showed that the facilitation effect is These are tentative conclusions and further research is needed to disentangle expectancy and pharmacological effects on retrograde memory facilitation The current study did not measure subjective beliefs regarding their intoxication level and we cannot preclude that control participants thought that they were actually drinking alcohol if they were told that they received Furthermore our results disconfirm a competing theory for enhanced learning prior to alcohol consolidation of memory traces et al According to this theory alcohol increases processing e of previously learned material Contrary to this view we did not find group differences in the proportion of correct responses provided Our findings are more in line with the view et al That is alcohol reduces the amount of new incoming information from entering memory and as a result preserves already existing memories Intoxicated eyewitnesses were consequently less suggestible to misinformation in our study It is important to note that we are not implying that incoming misinformation impairs memory for the original event in the absence of alcohol As highlighted and demonstrated by McCloskey and Zaragoza in a series of studies originally formed memories may still be intact and together with the misleading information They used the misinformation paradigm but included a modified test version Depending on their condition participants were either presented with misinformation or no misinformation At test participants were presented with two alternatives the original item and a new item misleading information was not an They found no difference in performance between groups at test That is misled participants were as likely as control participants to choose the original item providing no evidence for memory impairment To test whether alcohol indeed hinders new information from entering memory future research should use a recognition test similar to McCloskey and modified test version rather than a cued recall test The test alternatives would be the misinformation item and a new item If alcohol really blocks reduces interfering information from entering memory then participants in the alcohol group should be as likely to choose the misinformation as the new item at test Control participants however should be more likely to pick the misinformation item compared to the new item This finding would provide independent evidence for the claim that alcohol blocks reduces misinformation from entering memory In relation to the confidence ratings given for responses we did not find any differences between groups However we did find that mean confidence levels differed across response type Participants were significantly more confident in correct responses compared to misled and incorrect responses Intriguingly participants were also significantly more confident in misled responses than in incorrect ones The framework et al may offer an explanation for this finding When participants are asked a cued recall question several response alternatives are generated The participant has to then decide whether to report one or not This decision is dependent on whether the participant can retrieve any source memory for the alternative answers e any spatial temporal modal or social contextual Erroneous responses are usually associated with an inability to specify the source of the information and are therefore reported with low confidence Individuals might report suggested details with higher confidence because either the misled response might wrongly elicit cues e source confusion or the misled response was retrieved easily e with high retrieval In both cases the misled response would be given with increased confidence et al It is interesting to note that in the current study although participants were on average more confident in misled responses than in errors they were most confident in correct responses It remains to be seen whether the retrograde facilitation effect can be generalized to other types of misinformation Misinformation can be introduced indirectly through embedding it in a set of questions et al or directly through a encounter et al Gabbert et al The scrambled sentence task used in this study can be regarded as an indirect way of introducing misinformation Further research will be necessary to explore the impact of alcohol on suggestibility when the misinformation is presented in a more direct way Future research should also explore whether retrograde facilitation is present in more realistic forensic settings Only a few field studies on the impact of alcohol on eyewitness memory performance exist Oorsouw and Merckelbach Van Oorsouw et al and none has explored retrograde facilitation For example is this phenomenon also present when people are mildly intoxicated when witnessing the event and more severely intoxicated when presented with misinformation Such a scenario could be regarded as more ecologically valid as witnesses may be already mildly intoxicated before observing a crime The average peak BAC of in the current study could be considered fairly low and future research should test retrograde facilitation under higher levels of intoxication which are more likely to be found in the real world From a practical and theoretical perspective it would be also valuable to examine how long the protective effect of alcohol against misinformation lasts for There are often lengthy passages of time between the crime and the recalling of the event by the witness It could be argued that with longer delays all individuals might become more suggestible to misinformation regardless of their intoxication level after encoding and prior to the endorsement of misinformation g Hertel et al Loftus et al Would the inoculating effect of alcohol against misinformation disappear with longer time delays Future studies should also examine the effects of alcohol on retrograde facilitation on different limbs and of the BAC curve Research has shown that alcohol might have differential effects on memory depending on the task the memory type and limb of the BAC curve et al In summary our findings indicate that the timing of alcohol consumption plays an important role in determining how accurate and reliable subsequent memory reports are The assumption that alcohol inevitably impairs eyewitness memory performance is oversimplified We suggest that in certain circumstances alcohol intoxication can protect eyewitness memory by making individuals less suggestible to misinformation Scientists who are conducting research in the field need to take this into account when designing their experiments and interpreting their findings for example by asking participants about subsequent drinking behavior between testing sessions Given that some individuals were breathalyzed twice the delay between watching the crime video and the subsequent presentation of misinformation varied by min A ANOVA was conducted on the number of misled responses including the Narrative Version vs as another independent variable A significant main effect for Narrative version F p and condition F p was revealed Participants gave more misled responses for narrative A M compared to narrative B M tests showed that the control group provided significantly more misled responses than the alcohol p and the reserve placebo groups p There was no significant difference for misled responses between the alcohol and reverse placebo group p Importantly the interaction between narrative version and condition was not significant F p Thus individuals gave more misled responses when provided with narrative A compared to narrative B However this effect did not moderate the effect of Condition References L Bushman BJ

Background Observational studies on osteoporotic fractures in patients with type diabetes indicate their increased incidence compared to those without diabetes but results are inconsistent Currently type diabetes is not considered as an independent risk factor for fractures in elder subjects The aim of the study was to assess the association between type diabetes and risk for hip and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women Materials and methods We searched Medline Web of Science and Cochrane databases for articles published before September Studies assessing fractures in women aged diagnosed with type diabetes regardless of the diabetes treatment were deemed eligible To estimate fracture risk in a random effect model was performed The results were shown by the odds ratio and confidence interval Heterogeneity was tested using a test was analyzed with p and I measure Results A total of observational studies cohort and diabetics and were included Thirteen papers provided information on the incidence of hip fractures and seven on vertebral ones The revealed type diabetes was associated with higher risk for hip fracture CI but not vertebral fracture CI There was significant heterogeneity between hip fracture studies American origin was identified as a potential source of such heterogeneity Conclusions The results of our indicate there is an increased risk for hip fracture in postmenopausal women with type diabetes Keywords Osteoporosis Fracture Type diabetes Springer International Publishing Switzerland Background Diabetes and osteoporosis are two disease entities that significantly contribute to disease burden among elderly population Prevalence of diabetes is nearly seven times higher in subjects over than in the age group of years Diabetes is estimated to affect approximately million people over years of age in the USA and of patients from that age group in Poland Owing to disease duration and associated complications medical costs of care for diabetic patients are over two times higher as compared to healthy subjects Osteoporosis is also one of the main diseases characteristic for old age Based on the WHO criteria it has been diagnosed in million women and million men aged years in the European Union These numbers will presumably rise considerably due to population aging fractures the most significant clinical feature of osteoporosis are often associated with severe disability and increased mortality Available data say that the risk of death in a woman after hip fracture increases by when compared to her healthy counterpart Until recently type diabetes and osteoporosis have not been linked despite their in people over years of age especially in postmenopausal women due to several reasons There is no clear notion that would jointly describe bone pathology in diabetes In type diabetes absolute insulin deficiency leads to reduced bone mass density what partly explains increased susceptibility to fractures Meanwhile type diabetes is usually characterized by hyperinsulinemia and this difference appears to determine the quality of bone in the two subtypes of the disease Recently it has become apparent that patients with type diabetes have increased bone mineral density However many not all in these patients report paradoxically an increased number of vertebral hip distal radius tibia and other fractures Therefore the issue of fracture risk in diabetics is alone appears not to be the key determinant Obesity usually accompanying type diabetes in some ways has a protective effect on bone density whereas low body weight has been linked to higher fracture risk Thus determining whether type diabetes contributes to increased bone fragility and should it be incorporated into the fracture risk calculator seems to be of importance as it may contribute to a more effective antifracture intervention Owing to the fact that considerable amount of new data on that topic has become available since the last published we decided to answer the question whether in postmenopausal women coexistence of type diabetes increases the risk of fractures vertebral and particularly of the hip Materials and methods Search strategy Two reviewers and performed the search on the association between type diabetes and fracture risk independently We limited the database search to studies carried out in humans written in English and published as full text before September The scope of the search included available papers from the period between and The qualified papers were assessed independently by the authors between September and November We included observational clinical studies searched in the following medical databases Medline the PubMed Web of Science and Cochrane Collaboration Potentially relevant studies were identified using the following keywords type Eligibility criteria The studies were considered eligible if they evaluated women aged diagnosed with type diabetes regardless of the treatment oral drugs or We arbitrarily assumed that the time limit of menopause would be years of age Thus we decided not to include papers with younger subjects If a whole study cohort was separated into age groups we selected the one that included patients years of age Studies on men only men and women analyzed jointly and type and diabetes cases analyzed jointly were not considered for inclusion Diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of medical records patient or the fact of taking hypoglycemic medication or insulin We wished to exclude patients with type diabetes from the analysis that is why we did not analyze papers where authors incorporated subjects with diabetes from the age of If possible we analyzed disease duration and excluded papers with disease onset before the age of Studies were included only if there was a comparison group so that we could calculate odds ratios and mean differences in the outcomes between the groups Similarly if the control group comprised diabetics treated in a different way than the study group such a study was also not included When the authors of a given paper separated subgroups of type diabetics into insulin and other treatments we took into account these groups as total In cases where data repeated in articles published by the same authors in different journals the work with the largest study group was taken into account The fractures were confirmed by medical records from GPs trained adjudicators discharge radiographs and Vertebral and hip fractures were analyzed separately If a study provided history of prevalent fractures and the number of fractures in prospective observation we included data on incident fractures Where incidence density was given we converted it into incidence rate Data extraction Two reviewers and independently screened the titles for relevance Only titles that were mutually deemed were excluded Abstracts and articles were then screened for inclusion exclusion criteria Disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by means of a discussion Furthermore we supplemented the electronic search by reference lists of relevant articles and reviews One author was contacted personally In case of each paper we extracted data on the surname of the first author year of publication country study design number of exposed and unexposed subjects mean age of subjects and controls Statistical analysis The analysis was performed using the STATA software version LP model described by DerSimonian and Laird was used to aggregate the study data In case of zero outcome events continuity correction was performed by adding a correction factor of was conducted in accordance with the guidelines formulated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions The authors followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and guidelines for systematic reviews and Fracture risk analysis was performed using the odds ratio Statistical heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated with the Q statistics and the I statistics which demonstrated contribution of heterogeneity relative to the whole in case of each study The significance level was established at P The random effect model was used due to great I statistics value for the analyzed studies considering both vertebral and hip fractures The publication bias was explored by visual inspection of funnel plots and regression asymmetry test Furthermore sensitivity analysis was performed for parameters showing significant heterogeneity Results Characteristics of the study group Figure shows a flow diagram describing the study selection process In the included studies a total of patients were analyzed subjects with and controls without as data were repeated in Patient characteristics are shown in Table Out of these studies studies were and were cohort Majority of them for one used incidence rate ratios as a relative risk we used unadjusted measures Five studies

subgroup by geographical region and study design vs The analysis revealed that the higher risk of hip fracture was attributable to cohort studies only CI The cohort studies were shown to be heterogenous P I Moreover the highest risk of hip fracture was shown in studies conducted in Asia For European studies the OR was CI Discussion The results of our which included observational studies showed that women with type diabetes aged are at a higher ca risk of osteoporotic hip fracture CI when compared to their healthy peers In case of vertebral fractures diabetes did not increase the risk CI However there was significant heterogeneity in case of hip fracture studies In the subgroup American origin was identified as a potential source of such heterogeneity Although published revealed the risk of fracture in diabetics to be elevated by approximately from the scientific and clinical point of view it seems substantial to separate a particular subgroup of patients in the postmenopausal women They constitute the group of the highest prevalence of osteoporosis and owing to clinical consequences of fractures postmenopausal women should be the actual target of antifracture intervention At the same time type diabetes and osteoporosis often coexist in these patients sharing some of the risk factors Similarily to our observations Vestergaard et al showed that both men and women with type diabetes are at an increased risk of hip and wrist fracture but not spinal fracture However the same study showed the risk of any fracture in people with diabetes of both sexes was not different than in controls Janghorbani et al in their provided data on hip fracture risk in females with type diabetes and the risk ratio was CI RR calculated cumulatively for men and women with type diabetes regardless of age was CI for hip fracture and CI for any fracture One of the studies that made heterogeneity significant in hip fracture studies was the paper by Schwartz et al which took three observational studies into of Osteoporotic Fractures Osteoporotic Fractures in Men and Health Aging and Body Composition Study Due to eligibility criteria we did not include MrOS data However risk estimates were lower in this study CI Lower fracture incidence might have resulted from inclusion of in the Health ABC study are data on lower fracture rates in women when compared to white females This issue is more complex as recent studies show that relative risk of fractures in subjects with diabetes is actually higher than in Whites with diabetes By contrast Schwartz et al in separate analysis of Health ABC data did not observe an effect of type diabetes on the rate of bone loss for black women at the femoral neck or total hip The role of ethnic differences in fracture incidence is open to debate This also applies to Asian studies which influenced hip fracture risk estimates in our Given the paucity of data on fractures in Asian population there have been no such subgroup analyses in previously published There are several complex pathways by which type diabetes might influence bone health One explanation may be the rate of bone loss or bone turnover in diabetes which remains the topic of much heated debate Contrary to previously cited Health ABC study other authors demonstrated slower bone loss at the spine Lower activity of bone formation markers in patients diagnosed with diabetes was also reported although the data are inconsistent Moreover there are reports showing that in type diabetes trabecular bone structure is intact or enhanced whereas it is the cortical bone that is preferentially compromised This finding is relevant as the cortical bone builds of the skeleton and fractures in diabetes most often occur in sites rich in cortical bone The underlying mechanisms whereby type diabetes leads to increased likelihood of fracture are plentiful Much attention has been given to advanced glycation end products and their receptors whose interaction causes pathological in organic bone matrix rendering the bone more fragile and brittle Urine calcium loss resulting from hyperglycemia has a detrimental effect on bone density Negative calcium balance to what one might secondary hypoparathyroidism also play a role in the process At the same time diabetic nephropathy itself leads to calcium phosphorus metabolic disturbances It is also suggested that microangiopathy contributes to impaired blood supply to the bone and that hyperglycemia worsens bone healing Besides these alterations type diabetes subjects are known to be more prone to vitamin D deficiency than their healthy peers Last but not least falls often preceding are more frequent in described patients among other things due to coexisting neuropathy retinopathy and episodes of hypoglycemia The idea of incorporating type diabetes into the fracture risk calculator seems appealing however according to expert To evaluate clinical utility of fracture risk calculation in patients with type diabetes Schwartz et al estimated the sensitivity of FRAX in fracture prediction in that particular group Analyzing three study cohorts MrOs and they showed that the same value of a risk in women with diabetes corresponds with the T score of about units higher than T score in healthy counterparts In other words women with type diabetes tend to fracture at higher T score That is one of the reasons why clinicians intuitively believe that DXA parameters alone do not reflect the complexity of bone pathology in diabetes Potential mechanisms that impair bone competence and cause alterations in bone microarchitecture might be assessed by means of diverse methods g cortical thickness trabecular bone volume quantitative computed tomography of the although the vast majority of them have not yet entered everyday clinical practice Recently reports on the use of bone microindentation testing have been published Technological advancement has allowed to make this method minimally invasive This technique evaluates the ability of bone to resist crack generation and propagation by measuring indentation distances performed via in vivo testing Subsequently bone material strength is calculated Studies showed BMS is affected in hip fracture patients Although our findings support the hypothesis that type diabetes increases hip fracture risk it must be considered within the context of strengths and weaknesses One cannot exclude that patients with type diabetes or LADA were taken as type and vice diabetes might have been undiagnosed which would respectively overestimate and underestimate the risk In incorporated papers we tried to critically verify the type of diabetes in the included patients However the distinction between type and is not as clear as it was or years ago We also decided to incorporate studies that relied on diabetes or used old diagnostic criteria which altogether might be subject to potential disease misclassification bias Secondly there was relatively small amount of data on vertebral might result from underestimation of that type of fractures in general Moreover some papers relied on for fractures which for vertebral to other shown to have relatively low validity One study took all only account Conclusions Our supports the association between type diabetes and increased hip fracture risk in postmenopausal women The results however should be interpreted with caution due to large heterogeneity of studies Possibly they does not answer all questions on bone fragility in patients suffering with type diabetes but implies thinking about fracture probability in a growing number of postmenopausal women with coexisting type diabetes but implies Further studies are needed to elucidate the

the rate of lymph node metastasis increases in proportion to the invasion depth of the carcinoma Previous studies have shown a close relationship between microvascular patterns observed by Narrow Band Imaging magnifying endoscopy and invasion depth of the superficial carcinoma Thus the Japan Esophageal Society developed a simplified magnifying endoscopic classification for estimating invasion depth of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic values of type B vessels in the pretreatment estimation of invasion depth of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas utilizing JES classification the criteria of which are based on the degree of irregularity in the microvascular morphology Type A microvessels corresponded to noncancerous lesions and lack severe type B to cancerous lesions and exhibit severe irregularity Type B vessels were subclassified into and diagnostic criteria for or or and tumors respectively We enrolled patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma The overall accuracy of type B microvessels in estimating tumor invasion depth was We propose that the newly developed JES

Endoscopic prediction of the depth of invasion is essential in making decisions regarding the indication for ER in SESCCs Although predicting the invasion depth of SESCC is possible by conventional endoscopy magnifying endoscopy provides a more accurate prediction of the tumor depth in particular for superficial and SESCCs Inoue et al and Arima et al proposed magnifying endoscopic classifications based upon microvascular morphology and reported their diagnostic utility in predicting the histological invasion depth of SESCC as well as in deciding precise indications for ER However there are concerns that the multiplicity of classifications involving complicated criteria might confuse general endoscopists Hence the committee of the Japan Esophageal Society developed a simplified classification for the magnifying endoscopic diagnosis and predicting invasion of SESCC based on the Inoue and Arima classifications Subsequently we the committee members conducted a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the JES classification for predicting the invasion depth of SESCC Methods The JES classification Mainly focused on the abnormal microvessels this magnifying endoscopic classification offers simplified criteria not only for characterization but also for prediction of the invasion depth of SESCC This is essential for developing a treatment strategy for SESCC in particular the indication for ER Therefore in this classification morphological types of microvessels are classified into two categories of epithelium inflammation and low grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancerous grade intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive lesions The cancerous types of microvessels corresponding to histology of HGIN or invasive SCC are subclassified into three groups based upon an indication for ER as follows an absolute indication type or a relative indication type or and a contraindication type Diagnostic criteria of the JES classification are based on the degree of microvascular irregularity in the target lesion observed by magnifying endoscopy Intrapapillary capillary loops are a basic unit of microvasculature in the squamous mucosal surface The microvascular irregularity is evaluated for the presence or absence of each of the following morphological factors weaving e dilatation irregular caliber and different shape e various Microvessels are classified as type A if they have three or fewer factors and type B if they have all four Type B is then subclassified into and based on the running pattern or degree of dilatation of severely irregular microvessels The JES classification criteria are summarized in Table and mentioned in detail as follows Table Summary and schema of the criteria of the JES magnifying endoscopic classification Type of vessels Schema Definitions Invasion depth Histology A Normal IPCL or abnormal microvessels without severe irregularity a No invasion Normal epithelium inflammation and LGIN Abnormal microvessels with severe irregularity or highly dilated abnormal vessels Type B vessels with a formation b or HGIN and invasive SCC Type B vessels without a formation or Highly dilated

than Type A Normal IPCL or abnormal microvessels without severe irregularity Fig a Type A vessels of normal intrapapillary capillary loops b Type A vessels of abnormal microvessels without severe

markedly elongated transformation The vessels often show a multilayered arrangement or an irregularly branched running pattern a Fig a b Type vessels without a formation white arrows and inside a white circle is defined as highly dilated abnormal vessels whose caliber appears to be more than three times that of the usual vessels and the vessels often appear green in color a Fig a b Type of highly dilated abnormal vessels white arrows whose caliber will be more than three times that of the vessels around the vessels When target lesions have only type vessels the histological invasion depth is predicted as or When and vessels are seen in target lesions the histological invasion depth is predicted as or and or deeper respectively Auxiliary criteria of the JES classification Avascular area AVA was originally defined as a low or no vascularity area surrounded by stretched irregular vessels such as or vessels The definition of AVA does not include the stretched irregular vessels in this classification Thus AVA is surrounded by all subtypes of type B microvessels including vessels Since a diameter of AVA is positively correlated with the histological invasion depth of SESCC the AVA was categorized into three types as follows than mm in diameter Fig mm or between and Fig and mm or Fig Any types of AVA middle and surrounded by vessels are suggestive of or SCC and surrounded by or vessels are suggestive of or and invasive SCC respectively Fig a avascular area b avascular area c avascular area Typical AVAs are shown by white dotted lines Fig Reticular pattern vessels Reticular pattern Reticular pattern vessels are defined as plexiform microvessels This vascular pattern is often found in invasive SCC or types of malignant epithelial neoplasms g basaloid carcinoma adenosquamous carcinoma and endocrine cell with an infiltrative growth pattern e composed of single cells small tumor nests or a trabecular arrangement of tumor cells Intervascular background coloration Brownish epithelium between microvessels in a brownish area visualized by was defined as intervascular background coloration A prospective multicenter study on the predictive value of type B vessels for invasion depth of SESCC From January to August we prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with SESCC lesions scheduled for ER in five centers Prior to enrollment we used pretreatment imaging and or to confirm no findings of lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis of SESCC among any of the patients The depth of tumor invasion of the all lesions was estimated prior to treatment using a magnifying endoscope or Olympus Corporation Tokyo combined with NBI The estimation of tumor invasion depth by magnifying endoscopy was made based upon type B vessels in the JES classification and recorded in case report form The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic values of type B vessels in the pretreatment estimation of invasion depth of SESCC Table Participating centers Participated institutions Number of patients Saku Central Hospital Advanced Care Center Saitama Cancer Center Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital Sendai City Medical Center Informed consent was obtained from all participants The informed consent includes information about the possible risks benefits and limits of the endoscopic procedure and treatment We provided all patients with information about the possibility that additional treatments such as surgery or chemoradiotherapy will be required particularly if ER specimens would show SESCC invading the muscularis mucosa or deeper which is associated with increased risks of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis Especially for the patients with pretreatment diagnosis of vessels we provided the patients with sufficient explanation as follows vessels will be a suggestive finding of tumor invasion of or deeper tumor are basically contraindication for ER because of considerably high risk of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis additional therapy such as esophagectomy and chemoradiotherapy will be required if histology from ER would show tumor depth of or deeper We performed ER on all enrolled patients The lesions were removed by endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection Using the resected specimens the histological tumor invasion depth was established by pathologists in each center with expertise in gastrointestinal cancer according to the Japanese classification of esophageal cancer None of the pathologists were aware of any endoscopic findings We evaluated the diagnostic utility of the JES classification in predicting histological depth of invasion by comparing the pretreatment diagnosis with the histology from resected specimens Results All of the SESCC tumors enrolled in this study had type B vessels The numbers of SESCC tumors subclassified as or or and were and respectively The relationships between histology and pretreatment diagnosis of tumor invasion depth are listed in Table One hundred of the or tumors were accurately diagnosed by pretreatment and four were overestimated as or of or tumors were accurately diagnosed and seven were underestimated as or None of the or or tumors were overestimated as Eleven of tumors were accurately diagnosed Six and

committee members have developed a simplified magnifying endoscopic diagnosis classification e the JES We conducted a prospective multicenter study focused on evaluating the diagnostic values of type B vessels in the classification for predicting the depth of invasion of SESCC The overall accuracy rate of the type and microvessels was which is of sufficiently high accuracy for clinical use No or or or tumor was overestimated as Although of tumors did not have vessels vessels may be highly suggestive of tumors because the PPV of vessels was The sensitivity and PPV of vessels for or tumors were and respectively Thus vessels will provide optimal regarding the indication for ER In contrast the sensitivity and PPV of vessels for or tumors were both a suboptimal while the diagnostic accuracy of white light endoscopy showed a lower value at Previous studies have indicated that or tumors without lymphovascular invasion had a significantly lower risk of lymph node metastasis and a good prognosis Therefore or tumors are potential candidates for curative treatment by ER Esophagectomy involves severe problems related to its high mortality rate and a decrease in quality of life after surgery Further study on the definition of vessels is warranted to reduce the risk of unnecessary surgery for patients with or tumors In the JES classification we partially modified definitions of AVA which will be useful to predict invasion depth of SESCC as previous studies showed Although AVA was not assessed in this study we intend to investigate the predictive values of AVA and whether evaluation of AVA has a positive effect on the predictive value based upon type B vessels for in an upcoming study Arima et al reported that reticular pattern vessels were characteristic vascular structure reflecting a histologic infiltrative growth e of invasive SCC tumors or types of malignant epithelial neoplasms This study did not included types of malignant epithelial neoplasms and the type R vessels were not seen in invasive SCC tumors included in this study A validation study on type R vessels in predicting the histologic features of SCC and tumors is warranted Intervascular background coloration will be useful for predicting histology of HGIN and invasive SCC A recent study indicated that intervascular background coloration might be caused by an extravascular component of hemoglobin that is produced within tumor cells The other study showed that intervascular background coloration might be related to the thinning of the keratinous layer or the epithelium caused by neoplastic cell proliferation In this study we did not evaluated diagnostic value of intervascular background coloration to predict HGIN and invasive SCC The diagnostic validity and reliability of intervascular background coloration should be assessed in further multicenter studies This study had several limitations First the number of or and tumors was relatively small and no tumor resected by surgery was included Further study including greater or adequate numbers of these tumors should be conducted to validate the results of the current study Second a central review on both the magnifying endoscopic findings and the histology was not conducted in this study The endoscopic diagnosis and histology were left to each endoscopist and each pathologist in their respective hospitals Thus this study may lack diagnostic standardization in magnifying endoscopy and histology Third the endoscopists involved in this study are all experts Additional study involving is needed to determine whether the results of this study on diagnostic values are applicable in general Fourth the reliability or reproducibility of the JES classification was not assessed in this study It would be desirable to investigate or agreements in future studies Conclusions The newly developed JES classification is proposed to be useful in estimating invasion depth of SESCCs Modification of the definition of vessels will be necessary and further studies are required to validate these study results as well as to improve the diagnostic utility of the JES classification The authors would like to thank Drs Misao

First arising during embryogenesis macrophages replenish themselves in the adult through a combination of and influx of bone monocytes As large phagocytic cells macrophages participate in innate immunity while contributing to homeostatic functions Among the key metabolic tasks are senescent red blood cell recycling free heme detoxification and provision of iron for de novo hemoglobin synthesis While this systemic mechanism involves the shuttling of iron between spleen liver and bone marrow through the concerted function of defined macrophage populations similar circuits appear to exist within the microenvironment of other organs The high turnover of iron is the prerequisite for continuous erythropoiesis and tissue integrity but challenges ability to maintain cellular iron homeostasis and immune function This review provides a brief overview of systemic microenvironmental and cellular aspects of macrophage iron handling with a focus on exciting and unresolved questions in the field Keywords Macrophage Iron Infection Inflammation Erythrophagocytosis University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck Open access funding provided by University of Innsbruck and Medical University of Innsbruck Berlin Heidelberg Systemic aspects of iron recycling The mononuclear phagocyte system encompasses monocytes and macrophages residing throughout the body A central role of this multifunctional system beyond immunity and tissue repair is to control the metabolic needs for iron The maintenance of iron homeostasis at the systemic level requires iron recycling much of which is contained in senescent red blood cells This is a prerequisite for sufficient de novo synthesis of hemoglobin in the bone marrow a process which consumes as much as mg of iron per day The capacity of the small intestine to absorb dietary iron in comparison to the daily needs of iron is rather in humans under conditions mg of iron is absorbed from the diet in the duodenum and upper jejunum Thus dietary iron absorption only compensates for obligatory losses of the metal mainly through desquamation of the epidermis and the intestinal epithelium and menstrual bleeding Fig a In steady state mg day of iron is needed to generate new red blood cells in the bone marrow as vertebral The RBC of an adult human form the largest iron pool mg contained in hemoglobin After an average lifetime of days aged RBC are trapped in the spleen recognized by red pulp macrophages and eliminated Their Hb is recycled and ferroportin exports iron into sinusoidal capillaries where it is loaded onto transferrin iron is utilized by developing erythroblasts via TF receptor Erythroid island macrophages assist in iron uptake and differentiation Plasma iron content is sensed by hepatocytes presumably via and other molecules They affect the transcriptional activation of hepcidin the major iron hormone in hepatocytes Hepcidin acts as negative feedback regulator of iron influx by targeting resulting in degradation of the latter and thus reduction of iron transfer from the diet and macrophages to the plasma Kupffer cells inhibit hepcidin expression by hepatocytes and also engage in erythrophagocytosis b The lifespan of RBC can be reduced as a consequence of autoinflammation and subsequent hemolysis radical formation and toxin activity or based on intrinsic structural or metabolic defects The rapid accumulation of damaged RBC may overwhelm the clearance capacity In such a scenario KC engulf dRBC which may result in cell death As system monocytes are recruited from the bone marrow and possibly spleen via chemokines and and their receptor These monocytes encounter a niche in the liver and differentiate into cells that express which is induced by several mechanisms including the growth factor macrophage factor iron export sustains increased erythropoiesis in the bone marrow to compensate for losses by RBC damage Intestinal iron absorption is regulated to a large extent at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes It is at this location that AKA solute carrier family member fulfills its function as the sole cellular efflux protein for ionic iron shuttling apically absorbed iron to the circulation where it is oxidized and loaded onto transferrin The presence of in the absorptive epithelium is under negative control of hepcidin which is mainly secreted by hepatocytes in response to high circulating and tissue amounts of iron or upon stimulation by inflammatory mediators This negative feedback loop exists because of the nature of iron Iron forms the central cation of hemoglobin other proteins as myoglobin and cytochrome enzymes including the mitochondrial electron transport and enzymes found in most cells Free labile forms of iron and heme however are potentially toxic and threaten tissue integrity due to their properties which are largely based on the capacity of iron to boost reactive oxygen species production via Fenton chemistry Given its essential role in metabolism and cellular processes such as mitochondrial respiration an efficient and tightly controlled pathway for maintaining iron in the body must exist and likely depends on factors controlling the recognition uptake and degradation of erythrocytes by macrophages In conditions RBC recycling mainly takes place in the spleen In conditions of excessive RBC damage liver macrophages cells henceforward abbreviated as dominate RBC clearance detailed in iron regulatory organ During massive hemolysis circulating hemoglobin and heme are bound by hemopexin and haptoglobin respectively to avoid intravasal radical formation via the catalytic action of iron However when the capacity of red pulp macrophages macrophage population in the spleen henceforward abbreviated as and KC is overwhelmed the cells die presumably by a specific form of cell death called ferroptosis that is induced by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation To compensate monocytes fill the partial niche after KC loss and differentiate into a transient macrophage population that has a unique phenotype including the high expression of the receptor Indeed monocyte recruitment from the BM to the liver is mediated by a gradient of and that attracts monocytes to the organ As a consequence the BM enhances myelopoiesis and releases additional monocytes to the circulation to meet the increased demand This monocyte recruitment is essential because if disrupted pharmacologically damaged RBC accumulate in glomerular capillaries resulting in renal failure Comparable phenomena of KC death although necroptotic by nature and replacement of KCs from monocytes have been reported in Listeria monocytogenes infection raising the possibility that the mechanism is a general stress response that can be fine tuned according to whether the initial stressor is endogenous g RBC or exogenous g a In theory additional mechanisms by which macrophages may influence systemic iron homeostasis than its include control of dietary iron absorption or excretion It is generally thought that no regulated pathway of iron excretion exists in the mammalian organism Duodenal iron absorption however appears to rely on macrophages albeit indirectly via modulating hepcidin production by hepatocytes iron regulatory organ To the best of our knowledge no data exist on whether lamina propria macrophages in the small intestine affect absorptive enterocyte iron transporter expression or function although this is possible given that macrophages produce small amounts of hepcidin in response to inflammatory stimuli However one might speculate that intestinal infection might alter absorption by shifting intestinal stem cell differentiation towards progeny such as Paneth or Tuft cells and by promoting recruitment of inflammatory macrophages Although hypothetical such a mechanism might be initiated by myeloid cells since lamina propria macrophages and dendritic cells will be one of the first cell types to engage in host response to invasive pathogens Erythrophagocytosis The physiologic senescence of RBC is associated with mechanical and biochemical alterations of their membrane such as reduced flexibility exposure of phosphatidylserine on their surface and clustering of band followed by binding of antibodies and complement The microanatomy of splenic sinusoidal capillaries prevents the unhindered passage of these senescent RBC Macrophages however recognize cell surface markers of senescence via scavenger receptors such as and Damaged and aged RBC are engulfed by RPM cytometrically phenotyped as low low and phagocytosed The molecular machinery of RBC recycling is relatively well described and its function is essential to tissue integrity given the capacity of free labile heme This capacity is potentiated by the extraordinarily high number of about heme moieties contained within a single RBC and the fact that RBC are the most abundant cell type comprising approximately of our cells It thus appears conceivable that a mechanism for heme detoxification exists The molecular switch to turn on the protective pathways within cells is the transcriptional repressor Btb and Cnc homology is a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor which has a high affinity for heme enabling it to act as a sensor of cellular heme levels Rising heme levels induce proteosomal degradation releasing the brake on two types of pathways First the competitive inhibition of nuclear factor binding to elements ceases for genes containing AREs such as ferritin h chain and heme oxygenase Second the degradation of induces expression of the transcription factor transcription factor of the Spi SpiC independently of SpiC is a transcription factor that is predominately expressed by RPM and erythroid island macrophages in the BM It is essential to the development of these cell types as Spic mice have drastically reduced numbers of RPM and EIM which lead to reduced proerythroblast numbers in the steady state supporting the idea that iron recycling is essential to sustain erythropoiesis factors provide an alternative mechanism to adjust heme iron recycling by macrophages to the degree of anemia and the need for de novo Hb synthesis Anemia inevitably results in low oxygen concentrations in the tissue microenvironment which counteract HIF degradation in the proteasome so that these transcription factors become available to genes containing elements interaction in response to hypoxia thus stimulates iron release from macrophages by inducing and as well as one of its associated ferroxidases ceruloplasmin Although many genes involved in heme iron recycling are thus and in macrophages are dispensable for heme iron recycling under hemolytic stress This suggests that HIF isoforms fulfill redundant functions in macrophages or that they are not essential because pathways are dominant is not the only cellular sensor for heme Intracellular free heme can also induce signaling via nuclear receptors and Furthermore the inflammasome activation via cryopyrin is sensitive to surplus intracellular heme while extracellular free heme can activate receptor supporting the idea that free heme is an endogenous danger signal Given its inherent potential toxicity the majority of free intracellular heme is promptly degraded by Hmox which itself is induced via in response to heme or other oxidative stressors is widely expressed in the MPS by contrast is a constitutive isoform carrying important functions in the nervous and reproductive systems Both Hmox isoenzymes cleave protoporphyrin ring which yields bilirubin carbon monoxide and iron in equimolar amounts The iron released during this process is either stored within ferritin incorporated into proteins or shuttled to the extracellular space via Outside the cell ferrous iron needs to be oxidized to its ferric form by cell hephaestin or plasmatic ceruloplasmin Thereafter ferric iron can be bound to transferrin and the bulk of it will the BM and be utilized in RBC production Therefore the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX to form a new heme moiety closes the circle of heme iron recycling Local circuits iron regulatory organ The liver acts as central orchestrator of iron metabolism through various mechanisms First among many other carrier proteins hepatocytes synthesize TF to cargo ferric iron in the circulation and keep free ionic iron at minimal levels Second even small fluctuations in plasma iron such as those originating from a single dose of an iron supplement are sensed by the liver and counterbalanced by an accordant change in hepcidin expression An increase in plasma iron stimulates hepcidin secretion which dampens macrophage iron egress and to a lesser extent duodenal iron absorption following its interaction with Conversely KC appear to dampen hepcidin expression since KC depletion with clodronate liposomes augments hepcidin and leads to a dramatic drop in plasma iron levels according to one study However other data suggest that KC are dispensable for the induction of hepcidin in response to iron or inflammation Studies in mice confirmed that is an important mediator to induce hepcidin in response to ligation but KC depletion did not alter hepcidin induction in this model While the physiological role of these observations therefore remains controversial it is tempting to speculate that KC may hepcidin production or that a circuit reports on the amount of iron acquired by KC through erythrophagocytosis A diphtheria depletion of lectin domain family member F a marker specific to KC might help to test this hypothesis Hepatocytes are also central effectors of the acute phase reaction that is induced during extracellular hemolysis and thereby produce haptoglobin and HPX which are rapidly consumed Haptoglobin and HPX scavenge free Hb and heme respectively and are ligands to and which are primarily present on macrophages including KC The destruction of large amounts of RBC in the circulation further activates low KC to respond with erythrophagocytosis KCs have a limited tolerance to iron toxicity and die in the setting of massive hemolysis as discussed above Erythrophagocytosis augments and FT expression by monocytes that differentiate to macrophages which transiently replace dying KC In the liver stimulates expression while which is produced in the spleen represses Upon differentiation these monocytes also express SpiC and bone morphogenetic protein While SpiC may program them to recycle iron efficiently the factor may have paracrine effects on adjacent hepatocytes by instructing them to increase hepcidin expression thereby lowering circulating iron levels However the major production of in the liver is by yet another cell type sinusoidal endothelial cells Since stimulates both hepcidin production by hepatocytes and transcriptionally regulates macrophage effector functions it may broadly orchestrate the interplay between various cell types Intriguingly there might be direct transfer of iron from macrophages to hepatocytes after erythrophagocytosis because iron contained in damaged RBC first accumulates in myeloid cells but is distributed to hepatocytes within week The underlying mechanism remains elusive but may employ as well as alternative routes of iron trafficking via FT secretion and uptake via FT receptors In fact it has been shown that macrophages are the major source of plasma FT The importance of for liver cell functions is evident from the clinical manifestations of ferroportin disease which is caused by various mutations in the gene Classical mutations of result in reduced iron transport capacity that are attributable to an amino acid exchange in the iron pore or to protein misfolding of The mutations mainly manifest in the MPS e by iron retention in because the high iron turnover of macrophages cannot be met by of functional molecules transcribed from the intact allele However mutations are mutations that cause hepcidin resistance of the protein In this case hepcidin cannot bind to and does not cause its internalization and lysosomal degradation Consequently a phenotype of functional hepcidin deficiency that is similar to classical type I hemochromatosis with hepatocellular iron overload occurs In summary hepatocytes KC and endothelial cells cooperate to maintain the iron homeostasis and we are beginning to decipher the signals that coordinate the function of these and other cell types recycler in steady state Similar to the liver several cell populations in the spleen RPM ingest erythrocytes in steady state eliminating more than of these cells per second in a healthy adult deduced from the RBC production rate assuming This enormous task has implications for the immune function For instance is a not eat signal expressed by many cell types including RBC is recognized by signal regulatory protein alpha on macrophages which then ignore the intact RBC In contrast RBC are rapidly cleared from the circulation Aging RBC partially lose surface expression of Given that specifically and substantially inhibits phagocytosis of RBC the reduction with senescence is thought to enable the elimination of aged RBC RPM are not the only ones that recognize though The absence of on RBC is also sensed by splenic DCs Lacking the inhibitory input of interaction they are licensed to augment and and start their migration to the T cell zone to stimulate T cells However it remains unclear whether or not erythrophagocytosis by RPM and DC activation affect each other In response to increased demand for erythrophagocytosis the spleen also produces abundant amount of which inhibits expression in macrophages It has thus been proposed that the emergency mechanism of iron recycling is less efficient under stress conditions in the spleen This fundamental difference between spleen and liver may be based on the fact that iron alters the binding affinity of antibodies Both ferrous iron and free heme interact with IgG to enlarge the antibody repertoire Specifically complexes have a broader ability to recognize bacterial antigens and kill intact bacteria In addition complexes protect from E coli sepsis suggesting another possible link between erythrophagocytosis and adaptive immunity Another aspect underlying reduced erythrophagocytosis in the spleen under stress conditions including infections can be attributed to the fact that iron loading of macrophages dampens their innate effector function directed against invading pathogens While the function of RPM in continuous erythrophagocytosis is clear we are lacking a comprehensive understanding of how iron recycling in the splenic red pulp and the immune functions affect each other for a closed circuit for iron recycling following myolysis A mechanism comparable to RBC recycling in the liver has recently been described in the skeletal muscle in the context of rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis the death of the skeletal muscle poses a fundamental risk for the integrity because myoglobin the oxygen transfer protein is a protein that can contribute to radical damage Additionally molecular weight of kDa allows it to penetrate the glomerular filtration apparatus of the kidney which operates at a cutoff of kDa so that in rhabdomyolysis large quantities of myoglobin end up in the renal tubuli where they can cause acute kidney injury Therefore the skeletal muscle is equipped with a machinery that protects from free myoglobin damage This includes HPX formation and myeloid cell recruitment Macrophages infiltrating the injured skeletal muscle induce the expression of and FT to contain and detoxify heme It has further been suggested that the induction of and by the infiltrating monocytes allows for local heme iron recycling so that the regenerating myoblasts have enough iron for de novo myoglobin synthesis It will be interesting to see whether myeloid cells also affect iron metabolism of skeletal muscle during more physiological conditions such as growth and whether there are perturbations in myopathies other than rhabdomyolysis organ exquisitely sensitive to iron toxicity The presence of a local mechanism of iron recycling by monocytes in skeletal muscle raises the question whether similar circuits exist throughout the body Given that myocardial ischemia induces substantial recruitment of monocytes from blood BM and spleen to the site of damage and its vicinity these cells may also encounter myoglobin molecules However the adult myocardium lacks regenerative potential suggesting that iron handling by monocytes infiltrating the injured heart muscle may be different from that of monocytes infiltrating damaged skeletal muscle Alternatively it is possible that cardiac fibroblasts use iron recycled by monocytes for proliferation and collagen synthesis Resident cardiac macrophages are one of the major cells of the heart They have roles in the pathogenesis of ischemic myocardial injury as well as in tissue repair thereafter In addition their roles in the metabolic activity of the adjacent myocardium and in chronic cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failure are increasingly appreciated and macrophages may either tailor the delivery of iron to the myocardium or accumulate and detoxify heme which may mainly arise from tissue injury The susceptibility of the heart to pathological iron loading is well reflected in ataxia an autosomal recessive disease with a complex neurological phenotype that inevitably affects the congestive heart failure is the most frequent cause of death in these patients Frataxin localizes to mitochondria where it fulfills functions in the assembly of clusters acting as the mitochondrial iron chaperone Given the extraordinary energy generation by mitochondria in cardiomyocytes it is likely that the cardiac phenotype of ataxia is primarily a parenchymal one that occurs as a consequence of mitochondrial heme accumulation due to defective iron utilization However it is interesting to note that the number of macrophages is increased in the myocardium of Friedreich ataxia patients and that these cells contain higher amounts of FT It has been proposed that iron export from cardiac macrophages may be impaired in disease Since cardiomyocytes are exquisitely sensitive to iron overload and iron overload disorders commonly affect the heart a better understanding of iron handling by resident or recruited myeloid cells in the cardiac microenvironment may open new therapeutic options However cardiac macrophages are already an established diagnostic target of contrast material in magnetic resonance imaging Specifically nanoscale compounds for iron oxide have been designed to being selectively taken up by macrophages After exposure to magnetic fields these compounds cause a signal alteration which is affected by processes such as ischemia or inflammation secondary to macrophage activation Blood macrophage iron overload as hallmark of atherosclerosis Iron accumulation in arterial macrophages has long been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis A comprehensive pathophysiological understanding of this observation is still pending However it is well documented that arterial macrophages typically identified by histochemistry on histologic sections within atherosclerotic lesions contain larger amounts of FT than those outside plaques Accordingly high levels of plasma FT are an independent risk factor for the severity of carotid artery disease and high circulating iron levels have been linked to impaired endothelial function and intima media thickening two early predictors of atherosclerosis Published evidence suggests that microhemorrhages occur in the vasa vasora of the arterial wall and that macrophages remove RBC debris by phagocytosis which increases their iron levels without overt activation In addition atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder closely linked to the metabolic syndrome and higher plasma hepcidin levels are associated with vascular damage as documented in a small but ultrasonographic pilot study That said hepcidin levels do not predict an increased risk for myocardial infarction or stroke in a study The specific role of macrophage iron efflux in the progression of atherosclerosis is controversial While the presence of the hypofunctional flatiron mutation of in apolipoprotein Apoe mice did not affect atherosclerosis systemic administration of the which inhibits hepcidin transcription blocked the differentiation of macrophages into foam cells This latter effect was based on enhanced expression of cassette transporters and two major cholesterol efflux proteins and on increased cholesterol transfer to apolipoprotein Importantly LDN treatment also reduced atherosclerotic lesion size suggesting that modulating systemic iron metabolism affects atherosclerosis progression A more selective approach that only targets arterial wall macrophages may be warranted as the metabolic syndrome can be associated not only with functional iron deficiency to be ameliorated by hepcidin but also with iron overload to be aggravated by systemic hepcidin The dysregulation of iron metabolism in arterial macrophages is not limited to the axis In humans expression of the ferroxidases hephaestin and ceruloplasmin was reduced in atherosclerosis Accordingly there is in vitro evidence that ROS contribute to LDL oxidation and that oxidized LDL particles induce FTH and hepcidin transcription in macrophages which may reduce levels and thus retain cellular iron In conclusion evidence is accumulating for a between the regulators of iron and cholesterol metabolism both systemically and locally in the microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque However due to a lack of mechanistic insight we are not able yet to therapeutically target one metabolite or metabolic pathway in the attempt to beneficially affect the other iron overload is implicated in neurodegeneration In the central nervous system macrophages appear as microglia and are in close proximity to neurons astrocytes and oligodendrocytes The microglia depend on the transcription factors PU by and and are important for maintaining CNS homeostasis in physiological conditions and for restoring it after injury This paradigm has also been addressed in the context of iron metabolism For instance after experimental intracranial hemorrhage microglia clear RBC but may also sustain inflammation and cause secondary damage It is thus conceivable that the molecular machinery for RBC degradation and heme iron recycling including and is essential for microglial function Indeed induction of promotes the resolution of ICH However this may not be a feasible therapeutic approach to be readily translated into clinical practice because various cerebral cell types differ in their cytoprotective enzyme repertoire and thus in their sensitivity to damage Cell overexpression of in astrocytes although neuroprotective in some in vitro models and in ICH in young mice is deleterious in other settings and results in spontaneous cerebral iron deposition and consecutive movement and psychiatric abnormalities with aging When the iron chelator deferoxamine however is administered early after experimental ICH microglial activation is blunted and reduced local concentrations of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin are associated with protection from neuronal death Therefore early DFO treatment in experimental ICH translates into improved neurologic outcome Local iron accumulation in the brain in neurons and is linked to several neurodegenerative disorders collectively referred to as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation Although generation of ROS and injury to mitochondria are likely mechanisms the interplay between microglia neurons and other cell types in cerebral iron homeostasis is incompletely characterized A paradigmatic yet rare NBIA condition is the neuroferritinopathy that is caused by a mutation in the coding region of the FTL gene Although FTH carries the ferroxidase activity that is required to oxidize ferrous iron and to contain it within the FT shell FTL facilitates the mineralization of ferric iron thus supporting FTH activity The composition of FT is cell and central neuronal FT are L In addition mutated FTL proteins may have a dominant negative effect on stability and resistance to oxidative damage It would appear that neuronal iron efflux is insufficient to remove surplus and potentially harmful iron from the cytoplasm Whether or not a transfer of iron between neurons and microglial cells exists is unclear However it has been proposed that the peptide is secreted by activated microglia and other cell types including neurons to transfer iron across cellular membranes Notably also affects a variety of brain functions from cognition to emotional stress Interestingly the syndrome that is caused by a mutation in a specific region of the FTL gene the element is not associated with iron accumulation in the brain but with the formation of ferritin crystals in the ocular lenses resulting in cataracts in early adulthood Several common neurodegenerative disorders such as and diseases are also characterized by iron deposition but they are not considered as classical NBIA Whether or not the latter is causatively involved in the pathophysiology of the disease or a consequence of neurodegeneration is currently not known as the influx of inflammatory cells and their subsequent death may contribute to neuronal iron overload In addition an intrinsic defect of neurons in cellular iron handling may exist For instance in neuronal cells exposed to amyloid beta peptide fragments iron chelation with DFO or deferiprone reduces ROS generation via the NADPH oxidase Apart from neurons activated microglia can accumulate iron in disease e g in the hippocampus as detected my MR A similar observation has been made in the setting of the HFE polymorphism which is otherwise associated with type I hereditary hemochromatosis and has been linked to neurodegeneration Mice with the homologous mutation in Hfe have increased FTL chain expression in microglia suggesting iron overload This phenotype is discrepant from the one of other macrophage populations but the underlying mechanism remains unknown Similar to cardiac imaging IONs are selectively taken up by microglia as a function of its activation state Conceivably microglial activation due to ischemia or inflammation results in MR signal alterations that can be used for diagnostics However microglia are also exquisitely sensitive to the potential toxicity of IONs because they are rapidly degraded within lysosomes and their iron catalyzes ROS generation Although hepcidin production has been observed in the brain models suggest that microglia enhance hepcidin expression by neurons via in a paracrine fashion These findings thus contrast to what has been shown for primary Kupffer cells and hepatocytes inasmuch as culture supernatants from primary Kupffer cells blunted hepcidin production The published studies provide growing insight into how microglia affect brain function local iron homeostasis and neurodegeneration The human brain is probably the most complex system known and we need to better understand how its different cell types interact both under physiological conditions and challenges such as cognition or memory how iron affects the function of the various cerebral cell types and how we can potentially interfere to prevent iron from contributing to CNS disease location in which iron aggravates light damage From an evolutionary standpoint the retina is part of the CNS It is thus not surprising that it handles iron similarly to the cerebrum Since photoreceptors are sensitive to iron toxicity local iron regulatory circuits including the axis operate in the retina glial cells and endothelial cells of the retina both express but only the latter cell type is sensitive to hepcidin regulation This suggests that endothelial is the gatekeeper for iron transport into the retina In addition experimental light damage to the retina results in microglial activation its migration to the outer retina and in induction of FT H and L chains These effects along with oxidative stress to photoreceptors can be prevented by the oral iron chelator DFP Therefore the retina is another organ that is sensitive to iron toxicity but has evidence of endogenous mechanisms to maintain local iron homeostasis in the microenvironment are Osteoclasts are cells of the MPS whose primary function is to absorb bone tissue in order to maintain repair and remodel the skeleton Osteoclast generation requires the fusion of macrophages the presence of the cytokines RANKL and and iron Osteoclast precursors take up iron via and utilize epithelial antigen of prostate as ferrireductase In addition the transcription factor peroxisome coactivator beta is essential for osteoclast differentiation Apparently both iron uptake and activation ensure mitochondrial respiration in osteoclasts as prerequisite for energy generation and proton secretion While transactivates genes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain iron acquired via is incorporated into heme moieties and clusters in mitochondria ensuring activity of their enzyme repertoire Conceivably iron overload is often associated with skeletal disease For instance surplus iron in thalassemic patients may promote osteoclast differentiation and function and thus contribute to bone resorption Arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints is a typical manifestation of type I hemochromatosis Elevated vascular cell adhesion molecule levels are an accurate biomarker to diagnose this condition but whether the adhesion molecule is also involved in its pathogenesis remains unclear Of interest circulating is shed by the metalloproteinase ADAM metallopeptidase domain AKA TNF enzyme which is activated by inflammatory stimuli In addition membrane is expressed on macrophages in the spleen and provides a molecular anchor to retain hematopoietic stem cells in the murine spleen although it is unclear whether this is also relevant to arthropathy Taken together despite the essential role of iron for osteoclast development and the clear association of skeletal disease and iron overload we have little information about underlying mechanisms Bone erythroblasts with iron Embedded in cavities and the spongiosa of bones lies the BM as organ of hematopoiesis Erythroid island macrophages are a population of macrophages that support erythropoiesis as The smallest erythropoietic unit thus consists of a central EIM surrounded by several erythroblasts stromal This microarchitecture is maintained by adhesive interactions because EIM depend on a set of adhesion molecules For instance EIM express the integrin which binds on erythroid cells and KO mice have reduced numbers of erythropoietic islands Similarly macrophage interacts with the on erythroblasts It is well characterized that erythroblasts expel their nuclei during differentiation and that these are taken up by EIM after phosphatidylserine exposure via and MER tyrosine kinase The transcription factor SpiC and its effector are both essential for EIM differentiation since ablation of either gene reduces EIM number Less clear however remains the role of EIM and in local iron management in the BM and mechanisms by which EIM may assist erythroblasts in iron acquisition One possibility is that erythroblasts acquire ionic iron via their proximity to on EIM However since exports only divalent iron and erythroblasts largely rely on to satisfy their iron demand one can speculate that either abundant amounts of ceruloplasmin and TF oxidize divalent are present in erythroid islands or that direct transfer of iron from EIM to erythroblasts exists However the deletion of by Cre recombinase expressed under the lysozyme M promoter results in iron accumulation in macrophages including BM macrophages and mild anemia This suggests that EIM utilize to export iron and thus function as nurse cells Such a mechanism may be particularly relevant in contexts when erythropoiesis is hyperactive yet inefficient and when local hemolysis occurs in the BM e in thalassemia Another hypothesis is that EIM act as that continuously releases adequate amounts of iron even when plasma iron levels fluctuate Yet another idea is that despite their other essential functions EIM contribute little to the iron acquisition by erythroblasts and that the latter import any iron the blood stream delivers Data in support of this concept has been generated using the model The depletion of EIM other had only little impact on the restoration of erythropoiesis after BM transplantation Concretely a moderate decrease of iron supply to erythroblasts as deduced from the reduced Hb content in reticulocytes was observed In conclusion much needs to be learned about local mechanisms and their regulation of iron shuttling from EIM to erythroblasts at various stages of their differentiation The complexity of macrophage iron handling at the cellular level Macrophages express a range of factors mediating iron uptake in the Table which essentially face only two pathways for iron efflux for ionic iron and feline leukemia virus subtype C receptor for heme iron although alternatives routes may exist One such mechanism may involve and one of its receptors LcnR binds distinct types of siderophores low molecular mass compounds with remarkably high affinity and specificity for ferric iron These are best characterized in bacteria but eukaryotes including fungi and mammals produce siderophores too While some of these compounds such as citrate are ubiquitous substrates other mammalian siderophores such as catechols are probably synthesized from commensal metabolites or dietary precursors Much needs to be learned about the biology of mammalian siderophores whose important functions may extend beyond mitochondrial iron homeostasis erythropoiesis and

iron overload may result from an increase in circulating or local hepcidin concentrations an elevated TF saturation free iron excess or hemolysis with subsequent accumulation of damaged RBC free Hb or free heme If severe all these mechanisms will overwhelm the capacity to contain store and detoxify iron resulting in an increase of free iron heme and or FT in cells On the one hand surplus intracellular iron may serve as nutrient for intraphagosomal or cytoplasmatic pathogens g for rods in the and the On the other hand iron overload differentially affects distinct innate immune pathways Surplus iron blocks the binding of transcription factors and to their respective target promoter sequences In parallel iron facilitates the generation of ROS and thus activation Therefore iron overload may cause a dysbalance in the transcriptional response to macrophage activation As discussed above scavenger receptors for the uptake of senescent or damaged RBC and for the clearance of complexed and free forms of Hb and heme are expressed at high levels in liver and spleen yet may be induced at other locations in response to inflammatory stimuli These scavenger receptors are coupled to a machinery of heme detoxification Its two major functional components are which shifts heme from the endosome lysosome to the cytoplasm and which then metabolizes heme In addition to the scavenger receptors and divalent metal transporter two ubiquitous iron import proteins are also expressed by macrophages A broad spectrum of iron uptake pathways Macrophages express a range of factors mediating iron uptake although the relative importance of these factors to different macrophage populations has not been systematically studied It is well established that RPM and KC express the complete machinery for RBC clearance and heme iron recycling At either of these locations and and two members of the scavenger receptor family are expressed at high levels Whereas binds both free and Hb accepts complexes However many other molecules participate in the overall process Among these gene shifts heme from the endosome lysosome to the cytoplasm which is then metabolized by At the cell surface membrane macrophages possess the heme exporter Flvcr and its genetic deletion results in RPM iron overload which is also known as is widely expressed by isolated macrophages and it may form a major route of iron uptake in the absence of RBC indirect iron though it also appears to be important in adaptive immunity shifts iron from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm and in its alternately spliced form from the endosome to the cytoplasm At either location only accepts ferrous iron along with other divalent cations such as copper or manganese and with an iron reductase The control of cytosolic iron levels FT is the central mechanism of iron storage in macrophages and other cell types However FTH mice have no apparent phenotype suggesting that iron storage and trafficking are well controlled in myeloid cells by other mechanisms One such mechanism to maintain cytosolic iron levels are the iron regulatory proteins and IRPs sense free labile iron and control cellular iron homeostasis at the level Due to their ability to interact with elements that are present in the mRNA sequences of FTH and FTL chains fluctuations in intracellular iron are promptly counterbalanced Interestingly the functions of and are redundant in macrophages and only targeted deletion of both isoforms via the system results in increased FT levels and intracellular iron retention The deletion of both IRPs in macrophages does not affect RBC recycling but impairs their nutritional immune functions against intracellular bacteria such as Salmonella Typhimurium This pathogen preferentially infects murine macrophages and has a proliferative advantage in the absence of both IRPs resulting in increased bacterial burden and reduced survival in a systemic infection model Therefore macrophage IRPs are required to regulate their effector functions upon infection with an pathogen Interplay of macrophage iron metabolism and immune functions Macrophage iron metabolism and immune functions are interconnected Clinical data as well as many studies in infection models show that macrophage iron overload often resulting from hemolysis or iron supplementation interferes with their antimicrobial activity Several mechanisms explain this negative effect that surplus iron has on macrophage effector functions and the outcome of infectious diseases First a range of intracellular microbes can resist killing by macrophages by gaining access to macrophage iron pools Second iron alters gene transcription translation and mitochondrial respiration in macrophages Specifically macrophage functions driven by are impaired when macrophages are exposed to surplus iron largely because iron directly inhibits the binding activities of the transcription factors nuclear factor and factor Because of its inhibitory effects on and iron excess blocks transcription and the high output formation of NO which worsens bacterial killing of macrophages In addition in conjunction with ligation results in activation of and increased transcription of thus aggravating macrophage iron overload Moreover hypoxia impairs NO production by and thus blunts the antimicrobial activity of macrophages towards Leishmania major Another layer of complexity is added by the fact that signaling stabilizes activation via induction of FTH and hypoxia stimulates expression in myeloid cells thus undermining Leishmania killing Mechanistically these two modes of HIF activation are distinct While signaling results in depletion of iron as which prolyl hydroxylases require to tag HIF for degradation hypoxia per definition impairs PHD activity due to a lack of their substrate oxygen Nevertheless both hypoxia to anemia or impaired and the presence of TLR ligands may be present at sites of infection in close spatial or temporal association In addition monocytes may be exposed to fluctuating levels of both stimuli and as they travel to sites of injury and infiltrate the tissue to differentiate and become sessile Therefore due to its sensitivity to both oxygen and iron the transcription factor appears to hold a central position in the interplay of macrophage iron homeostasis and immunity In contrast to its inhibitory effect on NO iron stimulates the generation of ROS which may promote their antimicrobial activity but contribute to tissue damage and the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders In this context iron present in heme can stimulate the production of ROS and of cytokines such as TNF and In contrast which depletes the substrate arginine by converting it to ornithine is reduced by heme These effects may contribute to the inflammatory characteristics of sickle cell disease and can be ameliorated by the heme scavenger HPX Accordingly free heme which is predicted to accumulate when is inhibited activates to induce TNF and transcription resulting in improved control of Salmonella infection Intriguingly the accumulation of heme during the course of hemolysis also impairs phagocyte functions due to interference with actin cytoskeleton rearrangements resulting in poor outcome A phagolysosomal transporter with homology to is Its cation transport function is directly linked to the antimicrobial activity of macrophages and DCs In addition the functional form of in myeloid cells shifts the balance in T helper cell activity towards which may increase resistance to infections while increasing the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases However the directionality of iron transport is still under some debate Most studies have shown that shifts iron and other divalent cations from the phagolysosome to the cytosol This pathway is important for iron recycling after erythrophagocytosis and serves as a mechanism of nutrient withdrawal that is particularly efficient in host defense against Mycobacterium Salmonella and Leishmania species However some data suggest that in fact pumps iron into the phagolysosome where it may boost ROS generation As discussed earlier nanoparticles are increasingly used in clinical routine for imaging studies Although intended to be otherwise inert it has recently been uncovered in tumor models that nanoparticles may alter the biology of both tumor cells and macrophages albeit with favorable results Two elegant studies have shown that the application of nanoparticles to mice is sufficient to induce clinical remission One of these papers implicated a direct tumoricidal effect of iron delivered by ultrasmall polyethylene glycol particles and attributed tumor regression to the induction of ferroptosis in malignant cells The other study suggested that IONs stimulate TNF expression while inhibiting which results in improved killing of tumor cells These novel and exciting data support the general idea that the modulation of macrophage iron homeostasis is a promising way to control their immune functions and alter disease processes in infection atherosclerosis and possibly also cancer Conclusion The MPS comprises a heterogeneous population of leukocytes It is a cornerstone of innate immunity regulates the adaptive immune system and is indispensable for tissue development homeostasis and repair One of central metabolic functions is to eliminate senescent and damaged RBCs and to recycle their iron to maintain systemic and cellular iron homeostasis The role of macrophages in iron handling preserves iron homeostasis and tissue integrity Under physiologic conditions macrophages recycle the iron for erythropoiesis while under hemolytic stress macrophages detoxify heme to prevent iron toxicity towards parenchymal cells and tissues Only recently we have begun to appreciate the specific functions of various macrophage populations in the body and to study their potential roles iron metabolism New technologies are entering the field including systems biology approaches in situ LASER capture single cell RNA sequencing cell genomic editing with CRISPR and cell vectors to silence genes of interest Such methods will be important to critically interrogate results obtained by more drastic and unspecific approaches as global macrophage depletion or MAC and to understand the spatiotemporal orchestration of iron metabolism at the single cell level and in the context of the tissue microenvironment characterized by contact and paracrine signals Most of all

articulation These implants had a high rate of early aseptic loosening but a number achieved good implant survival stimulating the reintroduction of second and third generation implants of this type In this study we analysed archival histopathology of periprosthetic tissues in twenty cases of MF aseptic implant failure to determine if there was evidence of an innate and adaptive immune response similar to that seen in modern MoM implants The presence of macrophages the extent of necrosis and the ALVAL response were graded Variable but in most cases extensive tissue necrosis was associated with a heavy macrophage response to wear particles in periprosthetic most cases also contained evidence of a predominantly lymphocyte response which in eight cases was moderate or heavy Grade Our findings show that inflammatory and necrotic changes to deposition of wear particles are found in periprosthetic tissues of failed MF implants indicating that there is an innate and adaptive response similar to that noted in second third generation MoM they also suggest that the pathobiological response to metal wear particles is likely to have contributed to MF implant failure in these cases Graphical Abstract Springer Media New York Introduction G K McKee and J developed a metal on metal hip joint prosthesis for total hip replacement in the Large numbers of these implants were implanted but they eventually fell out of favour when superior outcomes were reported with the Charnley metal on polyethylene prosthesis It was noted that hip replacements had a high rate of aseptic loosening in the first McKee stopped using the system in Failure of MF implants was thought to be due mainly to poor implant design The stem of the femoral component was curved with narrow medial and lateral borders and had multiple sharp corners These features resulted in areas of high localised stress within the cement the broad neck of the MF femoral component was also prone to impingement against the metal rim of the acetabular component The original surgical technique for implantation did not include reaming and routine deepening of the acetabulum and as a result the components did not have adequate lateral bone cover Despite these shortcomings some MF hip replacements have shown impressive survival outcomes with several lasting more than years The relative success of some MF and other MoM implant designs stimulated the drive to develop and MoM hip implants The modern MoM implants are composed of a molybdenum alloy similar to that used in the MF implant Although some second and MoM designs have performed reasonably a number have been associated with implant failure This is considered to be due in large measure to the pathobiological response to deposition of wear particles in periprosthetic tissues in which extensive necrosis an innate and foreign body macrophage response to wear is often seen as well as prominent lymphoid infiltrate which is characteristically perivascular in this has been termed ALVAL and is believed to reflect the adaptive immune response to wear in periprosthetic tissues There are relatively few reports on the histopathology of failed MF hip some of these noted pathological changes similar to those reported in and MoM hip implants With one exception these studies examined only a handful of cases In this study we have analysed histopathological findings in periprosthetic tissues around twenty failed MF hip implants with regard to the inflammatory and necrotic changes known to be associated with and MoM hip implants Our aim has been to determine whether particles from MF implants induced a similar pathobiological response in periprosthetic tissues particularly with regard to the necrotic and inflammatory changes that reflect the innate and adaptive host immune response to deposition of wear particles Materials and methods Periprosthetic tissue histology from twenty cases of failed MF hip implants undergoing revision arthroplasty for aseptic loosening were obtained from the files of the Histopathology Department Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre Oxford The cases studied included females and the age range of the patients was to years The original hip arthroplasty procedure was carried out between and and revision surgery was carried out between and There was limited clinical information and radiology for most cases was not available Implant duration was to years Clinical information provided on the pathology forms noted that the specimens were associated with of an MF hip implant eleven of the cases referred to of an MF implant Two cases of sepsis were excluded Details of patient age and implant duration are shown in Table Table Case details and pathological findings in failed hip implants Case

all cases and the femoral and or acetabular membrane in cases The tissues were fixed in formalin embedded in paraffin wax sectioned and stained with Tissue necrosis and the extent of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in MoM periprosthetic tissues was assessed by histology as previously described The number of macrophages was scored as necrosis was scored as small necrotic small or large necrotic areas up to tissue necrosis more than tissue The perivascular lymphoid infiltrate was graded using the Oxford ALVAL scoring system this has been shown to correlate well with the Campbell scoring system In the Oxford System grade no evidence of perivascular lymphocyte grade little evidence of a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphocyte cuffing of vessels being fewer than five cells in grade several perivascular lymphoid aggregates with lymphocytic cuffing of vessels being five to ten cells in and grade numerous large perivascular lymphoid aggregates with lymphocyte cuffing around vessels being more than ten cells in thickness Immunohistochemistry was carried out using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique to determine the antigenic phenotype of phagocytic macrophages and lymphoid cells in the inflammatory infiltrate of periprosthetic tissues The list of monoclonal antibodies used in this study and their antigen specificity is shown in Table Table Antigen

B cells Dakopatts monocytes macrophages Dakopatts Dakopatts oncoprotein apoptosis Dakopatts macrophages Novocastra Results The most notable feature seen in the joint capsule and periprosthetic fibrous tissue membrane of all MF implant failures was a variable but generally extensive degree of surface tissue necrosis associated with an underlying heavy foreign body macrophage infiltrate The tissues had a prominent zone of surface necrosis in which there were viable macrophages and occasional giant cells containing some macrophages showed changes of apoptosis such as nuclear pyknosis Beneath this zone there was a prominent macrophage infiltrate Viable macrophages had vesicular nuclei and discrete plump cytoplasm which contained granular brown or black particles indicating wear particle phagocytosis On the surface there was macrophage necrosis and apoptosis evident as loss of cytoplasmic outline nuclear pyknosis and release of wear particles into the degenerate tissue matrix Histological findings regarding the extent of necrosis and macrophage infiltration are summarised in Table A heavy eosinophil polymorph infiltrate was noted in two specimens A few neutrophil polymorphs than per high power field on were noted in two specimens Fig a Histology of periprosthetic fibrous tissue membrane from a failed MF implant showing necrosis on the surface with underlying

Charnley implant a few studies reported similar rates of implant loosening Jacobsson et al reported a year implant survival of in consecutive MF this compared with for a similar population with the Charnley prosthesis Brown et al reported a year MF implant survivorship of and noted that the reported survival of MoM total hip arthroplasties was at to years while that of the Charnley arthroplasty was over to years A review of outcomes of the first cases that received a MF hip implant in Oxford reported good or excellent results in of cases A subsequent review comparing results of the MF and the Charnley total hip prosthesis in over cases reported superior clinical outcomes and fewer complications with the Charnley implant Amstutz and Grigoris reviewed the clinical results of MF and other generation MoM hip implants and noted as in the present study some impressive outcomes The main cause of early MF hip implant failure was aseptic loosening This complication was ascribed mainly to the MF implant being biomechanically at a disadvantage compared with the Charnley implant in design terms A number of reports however noted pathological changes in periprosthetic tissues that were proposed as contributory factors to the development of implant loosening Evans et al reported necrosis of bone and capsular tissue around MoM hip implants and noted a correlation with the severity and extent of obliterative changes in it was suggested that these changes occurred as a result of a sensitivity reaction to ions derived from metal wear particles Winter described necrosis in tissues around retrieved MoM hip replacements with particles deposited in acellular collagen and in phagocytic cells Jones et al also reported necrosis of bone and capsular tissue from retrieved MoM prostheses and attributed this to a toxic and hypersensitivity reaction to cobalt which he suggested caused an avascular phenomenon The study of Brown et al noted significant tissue necrosis and a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in soft tissue and metallic debris within cells and a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional plasma cells were also identified Doorn et al and Howie et al also noted tissue necrosis and the presence of lymphocytes in retrieved periprosthetic tissues around MF and other MoM hip implants Willert et al investigating failed MoM total hip arthroplasties also noted a lymphocyte response in tissues Other studies allude to the presence of macrophages and giant cells but do not mention tissue necrosis or a lymphoid infiltrate The MF hip implant was composed of a similar alloy to that used in and MoM implants In this study we show that periprosthetic tissues around MF implants exhibit similar pathological changes to those reported around modern MoM implants Cell and tissue necrosis a heavy infiltrate of macrophages in response to wear particles and lymphoid aggregates commonly seen in failed modern MoM hip implants were also noted in failed MF hip implants with approximately of cases exhibiting a Grade ALVAL response The MoM articulation tends to produce less volumetric wear than other implant combinations such as however the number of wear particles generated is an order of magnitude higher the particles being much smaller and therefore much more numerous per unit volume The particles induce a profound innate and adaptive immune response Macrophage phagocytosis of metal wear particles is probably the major factor in causing the extensive necrosis in MoM periprosthetic tissues particles are subject to corrosion and produce high levels of metal ions which are cytotoxic causing apoptosis and necrosis of macrophages that release lysosomal enzymes into the tissues Metal ions can also act as haptens combining with cell and tissue proteins to induce a specific delayed hypersensitivity immune response This is evidenced histologically in MoM implants by the presence of a predominantly T lymphocyte infiltrate which is often perivascular in nature T cells predominated in the lymphoid aggregates seen in failed MF cases suggesting that the adaptive immune response to metal wear is similar The presence of profound necrotic and inflammatory changes in the MF periprosthetic tissues would indicate that wear hypersensitivity and cytotoxicity are likely to have contributed at least in part to implant failure A major limitation of our study is that due to the many years that have elapsed we do not have full clinical and radiological information on the cases we have analysed Pseudotumours have been strongly associated with failure of modern MoM hip implants and though not seen in our cases there are two reports of probable lesions associated with MF implant failure Acknowledgements We would like to thank

cells such as macrophages reside in or infiltrate metabolic organs under obese conditions and cause the inflammation or metaflammation that impairs insulin action thus leading to the development of insulin resistance Here we report on data that specifically address macrophage biology physiology in inflammation and insulin resistance Keywords Macrophage Polarization Metaflammation http dx doi org Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Wunderlich F Thomas http dx doi org Deutsche Krebshilfe Berlin Heidelberg Introduction The steadily rising prevalence of obesity incorporates a major health issue because it is attended by fatal disorders including not only the development of type diabetes and fatty liver diseases but also the rising incidence for certain cancer entities In the first instance obesity alters whole body metabolism that frequently results in insulin resistance Insulin is produced by the pancreatic beta cells in response to rising blood glucose levels thereby leading to glucose uptake in insulin responsive organs Excessive glucose is stored in the white adipose tissue as lipids and in the liver as glycogen that can be converted back to glucose during fasting or periods of increased energy demands All these metabolic processes and many more are controlled by insulin The actions of insulin are mediated via binding to the insulin receptor The IR and the homologous growth factor receptor are receptor tyrosine kinases that use adaptor molecules for their downstream signaling These molecules belong to the insulin receptor substrate family of proteins that upon engagement of the IR or are tyrosine phosphorylated further leading to phosphatidylinositide and AKT activation In diabetes patients insulin action is impaired While type diabetes patients exhibit beta cell insulin loss due to autoimmune reactions against the pancreas type diabetes develops as a consequence of insulin resistance that is frequent in obese patients In obesity the compromised glucose uptake into metabolic organs induces hyperglycemia in turn accelerating insulin production in beta cells The excessive insulin production can partly compensate for decreased insulin sensitivity but progresses to increased beta cell mass and ultimately to beta cell death How obesity facilitates the development of insulin resistance has been discovered over the last decade Obesity has been accepted as inflammatory state that is also known as metaflammation Metaflammation is mainly derived from innate immune cells e g macrophages whose derivation fate and functional consequences are discussed in this review Tissue resident macrophages Macrophages are cells of the innate immune system that populate every organ They display great functional plasticity and are required for maintenance of tissue homeostasis immunity against invading pathogens and tissue repair Different organs harbor different specialized tissue resident macrophages which include red pulp and marginal zone macrophages in the spleen microglia in the brain peritoneal macrophages osteoclasts in the bone alveolar macrophages in the lung and the two major metabolic tissue macrophage subsets in the liver and adipose Kupffer cells and adipose tissue macrophages respectively Certain tissue macrophage subsets populate their organs during embryogenesis while in adulthood tissue resident macrophage subsets are replenished by monocytes that are recruited from the bone marrow The two major subsets of monocytes are termed inflammatory and patrolling monocytes They are distinguished by a defined panel of surface markers and chemokine receptors and have distinct chemotactic properties Inflammatory monocytes are chemokine receptor type and lymphocyte antigen c positive whereas patrolling monocytes are and negative but express high levels of chemokine receptor Expression of these different chemokine receptors allows them to follow diverging chemokine gradients Under steady state patrolling monocytes crawl along the vasculature where they function as immune sentinels They can enter tissues through expression of and differentiate into tissue resident cells with dendritic and features The degree of macrophage turnover under homeostatic conditions varies between organs Inflammatory monocytes are recruited to tissues in response to infection or tissue damage via chemokine ligand In the absence of inflammation they remain in the blood circulation Macrophage ontogeny Precursors of several tissue macrophage subsets emerge during embryogenesis Hematopoiesis during embryonic development occurs at two sites in two in the yolk sac and later on in the fetal liver Hematopoiesis in the yolk sac was termed and thought to solely preserve macrophage pools during embryogenesis while tissue resident macrophages are derived from adult hematopoietic stem cells However studies revealed that numerous tissue resident macrophage populations are of prenatal origin and emerge from the yolk sac or the fetal liver Microglia for example were shown to originate from the yolk sac while Langerhans cells are mainly of fetal liver origin The use of mice which lack the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell compartment shed more light on the development of tissue resident macrophages These mice still develop tissue resident macrophage populations including Langerhans cells Kupffer cells microglia lung alveolar splenic red pulp and peritoneal macrophages indicating that yolk progenitors give rise to several tissue macrophage subsets beyond embryonic development Notably these macrophage populations are maintained during adulthood under homeostatic conditions owing to their potential It is an ongoing debate whether determination to the distinct tissue resident macrophage subsets occurs during embryonic development or is induced by signals from the local environment once macrophage populate their final tissue On the one hand some findings support the concept that macrophage precursors could already be committed to give rise to a certain subset by the time they enter the circulation to populate their target organ Recent studies for example suggested that microglia are derived from a distinct yolk sac precursor while other tissue resident macrophages derive from embryonic hematopoietic precursors Other studies in contrast provided evidence that cues from the local tissue environment are crucial for differentiation into the distinct tissue resident macrophage subsets By comparing different tissue resident macrophage populations it has been assessed that factors shape the chromatin and enhancer landscape of macrophages thus enabling the transcription of genes Retinoic acid for example drives the differentiation of peritoneal macrophages by inducing the expression of the transcription factor which in turn activates a peritoneal transcriptional program that is crucial for maintenance and functionality of these cells The idea of in situ differentiation is supported by findings that tissue resident macrophages originate from a common progenitor in the yolk sac which populates the fetal liver before entering the blood stream to give rise to tissue resident macrophages Using RNA sequencing a recent study investigated the chronology of macrophage differentiation during embryogenesis EMPs give rise to premature macrophages that share a common gene expression signature Induction of specific expression profiles is initiated during organogenesis when macrophages enter the tissue Polarization states of macrophages Tissue resident macrophages express a multitude of pattern recognition receptors that enable them to sense a wide range of microbial molecules and danger signals Upon pathogen encounter they induce a cascade that signals the quality of infection or danger induces an inflammatory state and recruits other immune cells to the site of infection Together with neutrophils they produce bactericidal molecules and phagocytose pathogens to terminate the infection After the infection has been cleared they resolute inflammation by cytokines and lipid mediators and govern tissue repair by phagocytosing debris and promoting regeneration of extracellular matrix Macrophages exhibit a high degree of functional plasticity and the nature of an inflammatory trigger as well as the local cytokine milieu will determine the respective macrophage polarization and its functional state In this regard early on the distinction between classically activated and alternatively activated analogy to the nomenclature of T and macrophages has been made In vitro these subsets can be induced by incubation with interferon gamma and lipopolysaccharide or respectively The nomenclature was in particular used to classify macrophages into cells with or properties or certain effector functions The following studies revealed that distinct or stimuli elicit distinct transcriptomic profiles which led to the proposal of the spectrum model or more recently the multidimensional model However many important findings were made using the aforementioned stimuli Also many classical and markers are still used to assess the functional state of macrophages in vivo We thus will refer to macrophages with properties as M pro and macrophages with properties as M anti Triggers like the cytokine and or receptor ligands such as LPS initiate a response that equips macrophages to fight bacterial infections These stimuli activate signaling cascades that result in a global transcriptional reprogramming In this context signal transducer and activator of transcription and and nuclear factor of activated B cells are key transcription factors of and TLR signaling respectively macrophages pro generally have inflammatory properties and are crucial for fighting bacterial infections and immunity against tumors However excessive activation can also result in tissue damage and autoimmunity They present antigen and produce bactericidal agents such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide The latter is synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase from arginine They furthermore secrete a multitude of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and Three major cytokines are and is one of the first cytokines secreted by macrophages during infection and crucially involved in septic shock It activates the vascular endothelium and initiates the acute phase in the liver also activates the acute phase and induces fever In addition it acts on lymphocytes and activates cytotoxic cells or stimulates differentiation of plasma cells Depending on the signaling pathways that are activated upon receptor binding can also have properties is a strong pyrogen but in addition can induce the secretion of prostaglandins in the central nervous system Notably and are both potent inducer of and thereby amplify the inflammatory cascade induces differentiation and together with induces production by and natural killer cells which in turn acts on macrophages in a feed forward loop Alternatively activated macrophages anti were initially described during helminth infections and exhibit an phenotype In vitro they can be induced by the cytokines and Similarly as described for stimuli binding of to its receptor will result in a global transcriptional reprogramming One of the key transcription factors mediating these changes is It acts in concert with peroxisome receptor gamma coactivator and peroxisome receptor gamma and delta and which as will be discussed below are particularly involved in reprogramming cellular energy metabolism M anti are important players during helminth infection response to tissue damage resolution of inflammation and wound healing but can also foster fibrosis and tumor growth Their most important effector molecules include arginase lectins scavenger receptors and the cytokines and the receptor antagonist Arginase converts arginine to ornithine which in turn is used during tissue repair for polyamine and collagen synthesis Scavenger receptors and lectins mediate clearance of debris and apoptotic cells during resolution of inflammation while and are potent suppressors of inflammation Macrophage metabolism The differential use of arginine was an early indication that and triggers induce diverging metabolic changes in macrophages Over the last years a series of discoveries have highlighted a tight linkage between cellular metabolism and macrophage effector functions While distinct metabolic features of many immune cells were described we are just beginning to understand how nutrient availability can shape immune responses In the following we will briefly summarize these findings with a focus on glycolysis and amino acid metabolism Glycolysis describes the sequential breakdown of glucose to pyruvate which is either converted to lactate and secreted or imported into mitochondria When shuttled into mitochondria pyruvate is converted to A which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle by condensation with oxaloacetate The TCA cycle generates NADH and which are used to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation Apart from glycolysis multiple catabolic pathways converge into the TCA cycle such as and glutaminolysis of fatty acids generates while glutamine can enter the TCA by sequential conversion to Apart from its central role in catabolism the TCA cycle also serves as a metabolic hub that can redirect its intermediates for anabolic reactions when required Citrate for example can be exported from mitochondria and cleaved to and oxaloacetate by lyase in turn serves as a precursor for fatty acid or cholesterol biosynthesis and is substrate for acetylation reactions in the cytoplasm and the nucleus OXPHOS is the most effective way for cells to generate ATP and is used by most quiescent cell types to cover their energetic demands OXPHOS however requires oxygen and has rather slow ATP generation kinetics Thus under hypoxic conditions or conditions of increased ATP demand cells switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis to generate ATP This activity under normoxic termed Warburg effect after its discoverer Otto Warburg Initially discovered in cancer cells proliferating cells or cells with high anabolic demands such as the developing embryo epithelial cells or activated immune cells exhibit Warburg metabolism Switching to glycolysis does not only allow for fast ATP generation but also enables cells to diverge glycolytic intermediates into anabolic pathways such as amino acid lipid or nucleotide biosynthesis instead of oxidizing them via TCA and OXPHOS Increased glycolysis was described early on in macrophages A series of recent studies has underpinned that commitment to Warburg metabolism equips macrophages to fulfill their effector functions such as production of ROS or NO phagocytosis and secretion of inflammatory mediators in the context of bacterial infection Upon activation with stimuli like LPS or macrophages undergo metabolic reprogramming and exhibit increased rates of glycolysis and decreased OXPHOS By diverting ATP generation from OXPHOS to glycolysis mitochondria are available for ROS production Furthermore instead of being used for ATP production citrate is exported from mitochondria and used for fatty acid biosynthesis To compensate for decreased conversion of citrate to glutamine is funneled into the TCA via anaplerosis to The molecular mechanisms driving these changes are just being uncovered Some are dependent LPS for example induces which increases glycolytic flux by generating Moreover the responsive gene factor alpha was identified as another central metabolic regulator in response to LPS is an essential mediator of the hypoxic response partly by promoting a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis Under normoxic conditions it is constantly degraded by the proteasome and only stabilized under hypoxic conditions Ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of are initiated by hydroxylation of proline residues by prolyl hydroxylases In certain cancer cells that exhibit Warburg metabolism inhibition of PHDs can lead to stabilization under normoxic conditions A similar effect was observed in response to LPS stimulation In this context ROS succinate accumulation and iron were shown to contribute to PHD inhibition While ROS and succinate inhibit PHD activity PHDs require iron as cofactor for the hydroxylation reaction Indeed ferritin decreases iron availability to PHDs after LPS stimulation and thereby downregulates hydroxylation While sustains proliferation in cancer cells it upregulates glycolysis and also specifically boosts expression in response to LPS stimulation As described before arginine metabolism to citrulline and NO is a key effector function of macrophages Indeed changes in glutamine metabolism upon stimulation supply arginine and boost NO production by iNOS While macrophages mainly rely on glycolysis macrophages exhibit an oxidative phenotype Upon stimulation macrophages increase fatty acid uptake and OXPHOS These metabolic rearrangements are initiated by and In concert with and PPAR they induce mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of genes that are involved in and OXPHOS These studies also highlighted a role for PPARs in the control of metabolic disease and maintaining insulin sensitivity Furthermore recent studies have highlighted the tight connection between macrophage metabolism and its effector functions in helminth infection and identified lysosomal lipolysis as alternative pathway to foster Notably the authors of this study showed that blockade of lysosomal liposysis during H polygyrus infection results in defective clearance of the pathogen and inhibits commitment to OXPHOS by macrophages macrophages maintain an intact active TCA cycle and generate ATP mainly via OXPHOS While changes in are the most striking metabolic adaptations in response to metabolomic studies also revealed that glycolysis as well as glutaminolysis contribute to TCA activity Notably glutamine deprivation inhibits M anti macrophage induction in vitro whereas inhibition of glycolysis only affects a small subset of target genes Thus while macrophages undergo drastic metabolic changes in response to and triggers like LPS and respectively their diverse effector functions and locations differentially affect whole body metabolism underlining their central role in organismal physiology Adipose tissue macrophages and Kupffer cells in homeostasis Besides their role in sensing infection and tissue damage tissue resident macrophages have important homeostatic and trophic functions Limiting inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis are extra crucial functions of the liver resident Kupffer cells and adipose tissue macrophages In obesity insulin resistance develops as a consequence of metaflammation in which elevated circulating levels of cytokines such as and negatively affect the insulin signaling cascade The main source for these inflammatory mediators in obesity is hepatic and WAT macrophages Macrophages adapt in their residing tissue to local circumstances and exert numerous effector functions such as phagocytosis and cytokine production In the obese state macrophages in the WAT and the liver are major players in regulating metaflammation Macrophages sense factors derived from pathogens or from cells belonging to innate and adaptive systems as well as from specialized cells in the affected tissue We will refer here on the impact of ATM and KC in the development of insulin resistance Adipose tissue macrophages Adipose tissue is one of the major metabolic organs that stores excess nutrients as triacylglycerides and releases fatty acids in the fasted state which serve as energy source for peripheral tissues Under homeostatic conditions adipose tissue is populated with macrophages that exhibit a M anti like phenotype and govern adipocyte lipid metabolism by secreting factors such as and catecholamines enhances adipocyte insulin sensitivity and lipogenesis whereas catecholamines trigger lipolysis in adipocytes Under conditions of excessive lipolysis they control release of fatty acids into the circulation by serving as buffer While the ontogeny of other tissue macrophage subsets is well studied less is known about ATM Under inflammatory conditions monocytes enter adipose tissue in a manner The origin of ATMs under homeostatic conditions is a matter of debate Interestingly WAT contains a pool of Lin cells that share features of hematopoietic stem cells This population fails to populate bone marrow in mice but is capable of replenishing the innate immune cell pool in adipose tissue ATMs might thus be regenerated in situ independent of the bone marrow A pioneering study from Hotamisligil and Spiegelman identified adipocytes as source of in the WAT that ultimately impaired insulin signaling in obesity However findings by Xu et al demonstrated that mainly the stromal vascular fraction of the obese WAT expresses inflammatory cytokines Currently the view that the majority of other cells than adipocytes in the obese WAT are macrophages is supported whereas in lean conditions these cells represent approximately While in lean WAT mainly alternative M anti like macrophages express molecules in obese WAT macrophage polarization is shifted towards a M pro like phenotype The increased abundance and activation of macrophages in the obese WAT can be accounted by adipose tissue stress that includes elevated amounts of free fatty acids and LPS LPS which is presumably microbiome derived is not only abundant in WAT but also found in the circulation of obese individuals LPS and fatty acids such as palmitate activate signaling in ATMs that polarizes them towards M pro macrophages Subsequently these stimuli trigger expression of and in ATMs that compromise insulin action not only locally in the WAT but also systemically since they are released to circulation Thus it is tempting to speculate that metaflammation is a consequence of local innate immune response in the WAT that spills over via the blood to other organs due to the blood soluble factors involved Of note caloric weight loss including improvements in systemic insulin sensitivity and whole body glucose metabolism ameliorated metaflammation in the liver but not in adipose tissue suggesting that ATMs maintain WAT inflammation The M anti like ATMs in lean WAT express the cell surface marker and exhibit properties such as expression These M anti like ATMs synergize with regulatory T cells and innate type lymphoid cells to maintain the WAT environment Tregs T cells cells and even adipocytes provide and in the lean WAT to keep ATMs in an M anti like state In the course of obesity monocyte recruitment as well as local proliferation gives rise to novel ATMs that polarize towards a M pro like phenotype that express the surface marker Abruptly the WAT environment has changed from to conditions indicated by the lack of Treg cells and infiltration of cytotoxic and T cells as well as NK cells Besides the already mentioned M pro polarizing LPS T cells and NK cells in the obese WAT provide which sustains polarization towards the M pro phenotype ATMs accumulate intracellular lipids not only via phagocytosis of dying adipocytes resulting in crown like structures in the WAT but also via fatty acid uptake The metabolism of obese ATMs has changed to glycolysis which is necessary for the production of nitric oxide by iNos to increase macrophage responses M pro macrophages take up glucose via glucose transporter that further triggers M pro polarization Therefore it is not surprising that the polarizing environment in the obese WAT in vivo cannot be completely recapitulated in vitro in bone macrophages For instance upregulation of expression is not induced by sole LPS and treatment in BMDM but can be restored by coculture with adipocytes Treatment with high glucose insulin and palmitate induces a M pro like phenotype in BMDM culture that releases inflammatory cytokines Consistently insulin receptor inactivation in macrophages prevents M pro like polarization Conversely M anti macrophages in vitro similarly as present in the lean WAT have not been reported but M anti can be differentiated in BMDM cultures by several means Supplementation of culture media with or creates different expressing M anti macrophages than those that require TLR and agonists Another M anti population can be differentiated by which shares properties with the other two BMDM subtypes Strikingly reactivity to is required to polarize towards all of these M anti type macrophages In particular arginase and expression critically depend on signaling Taken together reallocation from M pro like towards M anti type ATMs might be a promising strategy to resume whole body insulin sensitivity that would prevent fatal diseases associated with obesity such as development of metabolic syndrome and the progression to cancer In line with this evidence nematode infection or vaccination with nematode antigens reprograms the obese WAT microenvironment towards conditions resulting in improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance Kupffer cells and liver infiltrating macrophages The liver is essential for life due to its metabolic as well as immunoregulatory functions On the one hand under high energy conditions and hyperglycemia hepatocytes in the liver import excessive glucose that is converted to glycogen During fasting periods the liver maintains blood glucose levels via hepatic glucose production that includes degradation of glycogen by glycogenolysis and breakdown of proteins and lipids through gluconeogenesis upon prolonged fasting On the other the liver is the first line defense against pathogens via the acute phase response and clears infected as well as exhausted cells In line with its immune function the blood stream entering the liver through the portal vein runs through the gut as well as the WAT before In liver sinusoids specialized liver resident macrophages the KC sense and combat invading commensals from the gut to prevent spreading along circulation LPS for example can be detected in portal vein but less in circulation In obesity impaired storage of excessive lipids in the WAT leads to liver fat accumulation resulting in steatosis and fatty liver diseases The inappropriate fat storage in the liver results in lipotoxicity which in turn leads to liver damage and inflammation Thus in obesity lipotoxicity and elevated microbial load from the microbiota result in excessive inflammation mediated by KCs and infiltrating macrophages Interestingly depletion of phagocytic cells in the liver via clodronate liposomes prevents steatosis inflammation and the development of insulin resistance thereby identifying hepatic macrophages as mediators of pathologies Hepatic macrophages crosstalk to liver cells and adapt their polarization to states of liver condition cytokines and LPS polarize KC towards M pro that in turn induce a vicious cycle of and that further boosts and deteriorates liver functions The inflammatory boost in obesity does not alter KC numbers but dramatically increases infiltration of monocytes Furthermore inflammatory released by hepatic macrophages limits systemic insulin action and signaling in hepatocytes instructs downregulation of the inflammatory response in hepatic macrophages Collectively inflammatory signaling in the liver differentially affects hepatic cell types and might result in complicating outcomes in whole body metabolism inflammation and insulin resistance Obesity contributes to the development of insulin resistance through the inflammation or metaflammation Over the course of this process immune cells infiltrate metabolic organs mainly WAT and liver where they secrete cytokines that act locally but also systemically after being released into circulation The cytokine levels in obesity do not reach levels upon infection but instead are elevated compared to homeostatic conditions Moreover while during infection cytokines increase acutely and stagnate with the elimination of the pathogen the inflammation exhibits chronic character suggesting that dynamic modes of action have to be taken into account The inflammatory players in obesity are and but also include and many others In this paragraph we will delineate how and signaling impact on the insulin signaling cascade In a ground breaking report Hotamisligil and colleagues discovered that the obese WAT contains high levels of the cytokine In a study they could show in tissue culture experiments that media supplemented with impaired insulin action On a molecular level compromises activating tyrosine phosphorylations in the insulin signaling cascade mainly of IRS molecules but also the IR While at that time adipocytes were believed to be the source of in obesity Xu et al demonstrated that the stromal vascular fraction of WAT secretes cytokines that inhibit insulin signaling Moreover bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that mainly macrophages are the source of in the obese WAT interferes with insulin recpetor signaling at the level of IRS molecules IRS molecules are phosphorylated on inhibitory serine residues by kinases such as kinase kinase and atypical protein kinase C thereby preventing further downstream signaling Of note these kinases have redundant as well as individual functions in IRS phosphorylation and point mutations of serine residues to counterparts yielded the conflicting result that mutant mice developed insulin resistance Nevertheless genetic mouse models provided novel insight into how signaling interferes with insulin signaling in obesity On the one hand knockout mice exhibit normal glucose tolerance when exposed to normal food but are protected from the development of insulin resistance in the absence of body weight gain alterations on the other While this study demonstrated the critical importance of in the development of insulin resistance the dissection of further downstream signaling at the kinase level has revealed surprising results induces a dual kinase system that comprises the IKK complex and the JNK kinases The IKK complex contains the kinases and as well as the essential modulator NEMO all of which are essential for mouse viability as revealed by knockout studies inactivation showed no effect on obesity and alterations in glucose homeostasis However while hepatic inactivation conferred insulin sensitivity in this organ but not in muscle and WAT myeloid inactivation resulted in systemic improvements of insulin sensitivity upon diet challenge mainly due to reduced inflammatory cytokine release Otherwise hepatic NEMO inactivation resulted in global improvements in insulin sensitivity under obese conditions but in contrast to KO mice these mice developed liver tumors due to ongoing cell death and compensatory hyperproliferation Thus though activated by the same upstream stimulus kinases may play redundant and roles in impairing the actions of insulin In contrast to the IKK complex genes knockout of one of the three individual JNK kinases and is well tolerated in mice whereas double knockout for the most abundant peripheral and is embryonic lethal It has been shown that but not knockout mice are protected against impairments of glucose homeostasis suggesting an essential role for in serine phosphorylation of IRS molecules However conditional mouse models aimed at unraveling the cell as well as redundant functions of the JNK genes in the development of insulin resistance Opposite to what was expected hepatic inactivation of revealed a modestly impaired glucose tolerance and hepatic lipid accumulation suggesting a function of in the prevention of steatosis and liver fat accumulation Moreover skeletal deficiency revealed a minor role in glucose metabolism whereas deletion decreased levels and thus ameliorated insulin resistance However deficiency most closely resembled the phenotype of complete knockout mice indicating that a redundancy between JNK isoforms in peripheral organs exist In line with these findings macrophages are unable to produce inflammatory cytokines and thus mice with deletion of and are protected against disorders Collectively deciphering downstream actions of in insulin resistance revealed redundant as well as kinase functions on inhibitory IRS serine phosphorylation is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays crucial roles in metabolic and immune cells Similar to is also slightly increased in serum of obese individuals and mice which is believed to be detrimental for metabolism Here a bulk of is produced by the stromal vascular fraction of visceral fat depots which is directly delivered to the liver via the portal vein In contrast is increased manifold during intense exercise in muscle by that provides beneficial effects on metabolism exerts its function by binding to the receptor chain and the signaling chain complex in classical pathway The is expressed mainly on hepatocytes and immune cells but also cells can be rendered by a mechanism called is the process where adam proteases cleave shed the from the surface of cells that when bound to serum generates the soluble in turn binds ubiquitously expressed on cells not expressing to activate the same signaling cascade as the classical membrane signaling Both cascades initiate Janus kinase transcriptional activation of target genes such as is not only a negative regulator of signaling but also inhibits insulin signal transduction at the IRS protein level Here leads to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Consistently clinical studies link insulin resistance with increased levels Importantly weight loss reduces circulating and improves insulin sensitivity On the other hand however itself provides beneficial effects on metabolic processes such as regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis indicating that the molecular mechanism of how affects metabolism and insulin sensitivity is not completely understood When would exert negative effects on glucose metabolism exclusively the expectation for knockout mice would be the maintenance of insulin sensitivity However while Di Gregorio et al did not observe metabolic alterations in knockout mice Wallenius and colleagues demonstrated that inactivation favors the development of mature onset obesity and diabetes implicating that action on metabolism might be even more complex than hitherto assumed A potential aspect that may explain these differences might be the chronic constant presence of under obesity conditions We have demonstrated that in obesity the chronically high levels lead to the development of hepatic resistance resistance is caused by basal that chronically increases expression of in turn inhibits receptor signaling which can be identified by the inability of liver cells to react with phosphorylation upon exogenous treatment Such high hepatic levels might not only have impact on signaling but also on the insulin receptor signaling cascade by interfering with IRS proteins Consistently inactivation of in hepatocytes improves hepatic insulin action and steatosis in young mice but at older age these mice develop obesity and insulin resistance due to the activation of acute phase response and overt inflammation signaling in hepatocytes therefore somehow crosstalks with liver resident KCs that are the source for the inflammatory response In line with this evidence inactivation of the receptor in hepatocytes fulminates in the development of systemic insulin resistance as a consequence of inflammation Thus signaling in hepatocytes controls whole body insulin sensitivity by limiting inflammation Therefore considering the differential aspects of action under lean and obese conditions will contribute to our molecular knowledge how the metaflammation impacts on insulin signaling to ultimately result in the development of metabolic disorders Given that not only impacts on metabolism but also on the development of cancer and that obesity increases the incidence of cancer entities with an inflammatory microenvironment the dissection of signaling cascades will be necessary for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to combat such fatal diseases Conclusion outlook Inflammation triggered by macrophages constitutes a turning point in the development of insulin resistance It is not only that mediators secreted by macrophages trigger insulin resistance at the same time also beneficial effects exerted by ATM and KCs under homeostasis are compromised These include maintenance of a local milieu insulin sensitivity and control of lipolysis and energy expenditure Research over the last years has uncovered mechanisms that drive changes in macrophage polarization and how molecules secreted by macrophages affect lipid metabolism and insulin receptor signaling in metabolic organs The use of mouse models pointed out that macrophage polarization in adipose tissue and the liver is critical for development and progression of metabolic disease Reprogramming from inflammatory M pro towards alternative M anti macrophages might represent a promising strategy to recover whole body insulin sensitivity that would prevent fatal diseases associated with obesity Indeed thiazolidinediones and omega fatty acids are such exemplary drugs or dietary factors that improve metabolic disease partly by dampening inflammation In this context targeting immune cell metabolism might also hold great potential Systemic insulin resistance is also observed during pregnancy or puberty but most notably also during infection in particular sepsis During sepsis inflammatory cytokines in particular and induce a state of insulin resistance Moreover while in type diabetes lipolysis in adipose tissue and gluconeogenesis in the liver slowly emerge as a result of insulin resistance inflammatory cytokines actively induce lipolysis in adipose tissue protein catabolism in the muscle and gluconeogenesis in the liver and muscle during sepsis Central mediators include glucagon epinephrine and cortisol which are released as a consequence of the inflammatory cascade From an evolutionary point of view this metabolic response serves to support the immune system in fighting the infection and limiting its spread throughout the body in the context of sepsis As outlined above M pro macrophages and also other immune cells rely on glycolysis to fuel their inflammatory response to fight infection In the context of type diabetes and obesity increased glucose availability to immune cells might initiate a feed forward loop that fosters inflammation and further aggravates disease This article is part of

performance of a algorithm we have adapted for the purpose of segmenting malignant pleural mesothelioma on CT Methods CT scans were collected from patients F mean age in a clinical drug trial A random algorithm was applied to segment the the results were then compared to contours and correlated with measurements made using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour Results A mean accuracy of CI was achieved Compared to a median measurement time of min for manual delineation the median running time of our algorithm was min A linear correlation correlation coefficient p was established between the changes in modified RECIST and computed tumour volume Conclusion Volumetric tumour segmentation offers a potential solution to the challenges in quantifying MPM methods such as the one presented in this study facilitate this in an accurate and manner and provide additional morphological information about the evolution over time Keywords Malignant pleural mesothelioma Quantitative tumour measurement Computed tomography Image processing Therapy response assessment NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Gleeson Fergus CARS Introduction Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive thoracic malignancy that is closely linked to past exposure to asbestos It is currently responsible for over annual deaths worldwide a number which continues to increase despite legal restrictions limiting the use of asbestos in many countries MPM is currently the greatest single cause of deaths in the UK Although the production of asbestos was gradually phased out in the the long latency period typically ranging from to years has caused a continuing rising trend of MPM in the country which is projected to peak in Moreover asbestos is still being harvested and used in the developing world most notably in China and India where MPM is rapidly becoming a prominent occupational health concern MPM usually originates in the parietal pleura of the lung and grows as a around the pleural surface It has a tendency to encase the affected lung severely impairing its ventilatory function The detection of MPM on CT is difficult because of the complexity of thoracic anatomy and the challenge in distinguishing the tumour from neighbouring tissues in terms of both pixel intensity and regional texture A sample CT axial slice with the relevant thoracic tissues highlighted is shown in Fig Intensity distributions of these tissues Hounsfield are shown in Fig Their overlapping nature hence the low contrast on CT is evident Fig Sample CT image slice with key regional tissues highlighted Tumour is shown in orange a Original b segmented CT Fig Probabilistic intensity distributions of the overall image scan and individual tissues in the thorax a Overall scan b individual tissues To quantify the progression of a tumour and its response to treatment in clinical trials and patient current clinical practice recommends the use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour This quantifies the tumour based on a measurement of its thickness at two locations on three axial levels of the scan A major drawback of modified RECIST is that it measures the tumour at just six singular points irrespective of the overall shape and growth pattern As a result it is known to be prone to and variations In one study major and minor disagreements were found in and of the cases respectively Such discrepancies can largely be attributed to the inconsistent selection of measurable lesions and radiological artefacts such as the partial volume effect which gives rise to ambiguous tissue boundaries Additionally being one dimensional in nature the system fails to adequately address tumour growth in the axial direction Overall considering the low CT contrast between the MPM tumour and surrounding tissues and the characteristic growth modified RECIST is limited both in its ease of application consistency and overall clinical utility Noting the limitations of modified RECIST previous works on MPM have supported the use of segmented tumour volumes for evaluating the response to treatments Ak et al estimated the tumour volume by counting the number of evenly spaced dots that fall within the tumour boundary as determined by the clinical observer Though the results showed good correlation with patient survival and prognostic data it remains a manual method which would require tedious and radiological supervision Armato et al developed an automated method to compute for modified RECIST This method works by first segmenting the lungs by thresholding to mark the inner margin of the tumour followed by taking a thickness measurement perpendicular to the nearby chest wall or mediastinum The results were presented in terms of acceptance as determined by trained radiologists which was found to be as high as Although this approach offers some guidance for making RECIST measurements it still makes use of the modified RECIST framework and does not tackle its intrinsic limitations In view of the challenging nature of automated MPM segmentation Frauenfelder et al applied interpolation to tumour contours found on every axial cuts agreement of the segmented tumour was reported to be significantly higher than that of modified RECIST vs However although interpolation helped reduce the workload the method did not circumvent the need for manual drawing Liu et al presented some preliminary works on a MPM tumour evaluation where the authors studied the baseline and data collected from patients and found patient survival to be linked to baseline tumour volume with a good degree of certainty Chaosaowong et al introduced a method that computes a contour containing the tumour and pleura Assuming a convex shape for the pleura concave irregularities are treated as potential sites of pleural thickening which would undergo thresholding before the final classification In addition to being prone to issues this approach made numerous assumptions about the pattern of growth which would limit its applicability in a wider clinical context Sensakovic et al applied a more advanced MPM segmentation method based on a nonlinear diffusion model and a classifier For each of the MPM scans examined in the study axial scans were segmented on a basis and validated by manual delineations made by five independent clinical observers Mean Jaccard similarity coefficient was found to be p between observers and p between manual and computed segmentations which is less than ideal for a wider clinical application It should also be noted that this method was implemented in tested only with diagnostic imaging data and did not allow the clinician to influence the segmentation itself through user interaction Labby et al added an interpolation component to the method of Sensakovic et al and extended its scope to MPM studies An inverse relationship was reported between the tumour and aerated lung volumes which is in line with clinical expectation It should be noted despite the above efforts a method that is capable of segmenting all tumour cases accurately is yet to be established The segmentation of MPM presents numerous challenges one of which is due to the similarity in CT attenuation of an MPM lesion with its neighbouring tissues This is made worse by the presence of atelectatic lungs and pleural commonly found in patients with clinically evident MPM This largely precludes the direct application of simple segmentation methods such as thresholding region growing texture filtering and active contours The tumour may also grow in projections along the lung fissures or hilar vessels and can invade the neighbouring structures This would severely affect the performance of shape and methods Moreover the long thin shape of the tumour anatomical complexity of the thoracic region in particular due to secondary chest conditions such as pleural effusion intrinsic image noise and partial volume effect pose considerable challenges which collectively prevent the application of many established segmentation methods In this paper we present a segmentation algorithm that is capable of accurately segmenting the MPM tumour and has the ability to incorporate input from with good robustness Methods and materials Study design The data used in this study were collected from a Phase II clinical trial of Vinflunine which was tested as a therapeutic agent for MPM across nine centres in the UK France and Germany Specifics on the trial design and outcome are given in Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study For our study data from the UK centres were available collected from patients with a total of baseline and CT scans Patient characteristics are given in Table All patients had histologically and cytologically confirmed cases of mesothelioma and at least one lesion that satisfied the measurability criteria in modified RECIST as pleural tumour thickness of at least mm at three locations on the CT scan with a sum Each participant received one baseline scan and between one to three scans All scans are valid for assessing tumour responses under modified

scans was available with a voxel spacing of mm No contrast enhancing agent was used Random image segmentation We implemented the random segmentation method by Grady where details of the mathematical formulation are presented The method handles weak tissue boundaries well and is able to segment any arbitrary shapes with appropriately placed seeds The key steps in our segmentation algorithm are outlined in Fig We have extended original method to based on a graph model aiming to improve the algorithm performance by adopting additional image information from adjacent axial slices for classifying the image voxel in question it is superior to simple interpolation applied in the vertical axis because uneven tumour growth and anatomical irregularities are dealt with equally in the planar and domains and are therefore better accounted for Compared to its planar counterpart a volumetric segmentation would not require exhaustive initialisation on all axial specifying initialisation seeds on just a few axial slices is sufficient to produce accurate full volume segmentations User interaction seeds are initialisation points the radiologically trained user places based on their clinical experience in regions they known to be of tumour Using a method with seeds is advantageous because it gives the radiologists more control of the segmentation process by enabling them to influence both the initialisation and revision steps with their clinical knowledge about the disease Fig Segmented tumour contours on axial cuts of two arbitrarily selected CT scans

different seeding attempts b Number of seeds employed in each scenario Fig A breakdown of accuracy performance of the two trials presented in Fig Arrows point to the slices where initialisation seeds were placed However defining contour areas of known tumour instead of points within the tumour as required by random method on a large number of image slices is laborious substantially reducing the clinical practicality of the algorithm For our study initialising seeds are placed by a clinical radiology specialist with five years of MPM diagnostic experience based on expert knowledge about MPM and added them to between six and ten axial slices for each image scan that is one initialised slice for every ten raw image slices On average seeds were placed per initialisation slice taking s The initialisation slices were not evenly distributed across the volume they tend to concentrate around regions of difficulty marked by the presence of weak tumour boundary fluid and or collapsed lung Additionally to facilitate an effective response evaluation the same axial locations were selected for initialisation in scans of the same patient This is comparable to modified RECIST where the measurements are taken from the same transverse cuts for different scans of the same patient Further seeds can be added at a review stage if deemed necessary by the observer to enhance the segmentation accuracy This was only required in one out of every three scans The additional running time for this additional seeding process is minimal normally a fraction of the overall time spent on the initial segmentation as will be presented in the Results section of this paper All computation times are based on using a workstation with CPU GHz with of RAM Gold standard To validate our findings a clinical radiologist with five years of experience in MPM evaluation manually delineated the tumour contours on the whole imaging dataset Though such delineations vary between observers and over time for simplicity we refer to them here as the We recognise the fact that the reference truth used might not be ideal but for the purpose of our study and from an explorative research perspective we use them here as a surrogate gold standard To reduce observer bias a blinded experimental design was implemented where the delineations were made without knowledge of the clinical outcomes of individual patients and the modified RECIST measurements Data analysis and statistical methods The accuracy of the segmentation results is evaluated by calculating the index according to the following equation where X and Y represents the reference truth and the segmentation result respectively X Y DICE X Y X Y To assess the clinical utility of the method we computed the correlation of changes in computed tumour volume with those in modified RECIST measurement Results Tumour quantification Applying our algorithm segmented MPM tumour contours are computed in the axial planes

was min In comparison the median running time of the procedure was min The median total time spent on manual user interaction was min per image scan The computer running time could potentially be reduced further by increasing the workstation processing power or by incorporating the use of graphics processor units Although modified RECIST would take less time to measure from start to finish it remains a manual process which requires focused work from a whereas a algorithm such as the one presented in this paper requires little supervision and would enable this clinical time to be invested elsewhere Statistical correlation with modified RECIST Correlation with the modified RECIST is shown as a scatter plot with linear fit as shown in Fig This shows that tumour response found using the segmented volumes is well correlated with that predicted by the change in modified RECIST and supports the use of volumetric segmentation from a clinical perspective Discussion Assessing the therapeutic response of MPM is difficult because of the poor image contrast and its large variation in shape and growth pattern which prevent an effective choice of measurement points when employing modified RECIST These characteristics also happen to make the segmentation of MPM difficult It should be noted that apart from Sensakovic et al most of the existing works on MPM segmentation did not assess the accuracy of their proposed method in a systematic way Sensakovic et al whilst presenting a more advanced approach to the problem produced a less than desirable of was implemented only in the planar space was applied to only diagnostic imaging data and did not allow the clinician to influence the segmentation itself through user interaction Our proposed method on the other hand incorporates a framework flexibly accepts inputs and produces results that are consistently accurate and with competitive running times The results from our method are generally satisfactory yielding a mean accuracy of CI taking a median running time of s CI greatly reducing the time requirement of an otherwise tedious process The method also exhibits good robustness because changing the user seed number and configuration did not significant alter the end result A strong correlation was found between the changes in tumour volume and those in modified RECIST These results support the use of our algorithm in segmenting MPM for both diagnostic and treatment monitoring purposes A comparison with results from various published works on MPM segmentation is given in Table To further assess the applicability of our method in a wider clinical context it is crucial to develop and validate criteria for categorising tumour changes Oxnard et al used geometric models to suggest equivalents of the RECIST classification criteria in the volume space We note that given the small size and distribution of our data we are unable to validate these thresholds based on our study because only out of our patients would be classified as and the rest In addition although these geometric thresholds provide good insight into potential volume response criteria because they are based on standard geometric shapes they may not lend well to the uneven shapes and irregular growth patterns of MPM Currently the issue of volume response criteria remains a contentious area requiring more work To further our work larger patient datasets are needed It would also be helpful to collect more detailed clinical data from the patients such as measures of their quality of life and prognostic data preferably stratified according to age gender and disease stage at diagnosis These additional clinical data would enable us to better validate our method Due to the challenges in assessing the MPM tumour based on CT scans alone there is a growing interest in employing metabolic imaging in MPM To this end it might be helpful to examine the possibility of bridging the information obtained from segmented tumour volume to metabolic PET data such as establishing a correlation between changes in the metabolic output and a particular trend of morphological change in its shape Currently modified RECIST remains the standard approach to quantifying MPM in clinical practice mostly due to its favourable prediction of patient survival and its existing wide acceptance in the radiological community However methods such as the one presented in this paper are emerging as a new tactic to the clinical problem for their automated action and better performance consistency Funding This study was funded by the

particularly macrophages are crucial to maintain gastrointestinal homeostasis in the steady state but are also important for protection against certain pathogens However when uncontrolled they can promote immunopathology Broadly two subsets of macrophages can be considered to perform the vast array of functions to complete these complex tasks resident macrophages that dominate in the healthy gut and macrophages that derive from circulating monocytes infiltrating inflamed tissue Here we discuss the features of resident and inflammatory intestinal macrophages complexities in identifying and defining these populations and the mechanisms involved in their differentiation In particular focus will be placed on describing their unique ontogeny as well as local gastrointestinal signals that instruct specialisation of resident macrophages in healthy tissue We then explore the very different roles of inflammatory macrophages and describe new data suggesting that they may be educated not only by the gut microenvironment but also by signals they receive during development in the bone marrow Given the high degree of plasticity of gut macrophages and their multifaceted roles in both healthy and inflamed tissue understanding the mechanisms controlling their differentiation could inform development of improved therapies for inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease Keywords Macrophage Monocyte Mucosal Gastrointestinal Commensal Inflammatory bowel disease http dx doi org Wellcome Trust Z Z Grainger John R http dx doi org Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BB Konkel Joanne E Berlin Heidelberg Introduction The mammalian intestine is a complex environment for the immune system On one hand it must maintain tolerance to a vast array of antigens derived from food and the dense but largely harmless commensal microbiota On the other it must be ever ready to respond to potentially pathogens that aim to colonise via the oral route Failure to achieve this balance between tolerance and responsiveness can lead to mortality or morbidity as occurs in inflammatory bowel disease For ongoing homeostasis to be achieved in the gut interrelated highly specialised structural and cellular strategies have thus evolved to support this immunologic balancing act All the time allowing the tissue to perform its primary physiologic of nutrients water and electrolytes These structures include a mucus layer that creates a physical barrier to keep bacteria away from the epithelium a thick epithelial layer and a specialised immune network enriched in the epithelial layer and lamina propria Resulting from their phagocytic capacity functional plasticity and capability to integrate and interpret diverse and signals in their environment resident macrophages are well established as a keystone immune population in barrier homeostasis in health Moreover following initiation of an inflammatory response macrophages from circulating blood monocytes called into the affected in tandem with their resident partners play crucial roles in control of infection Thus in the face of the myriad challenges that the intestine will face over a lifetime the dynamic regulation of the intestinal macrophage pool is at the centre of health Macrophage biology is a field that has seen explosive growth in recent years particularly in the gut A large number of studies including our work have begun to establish how the ontogeny and differentiation of these cells is tailored by and to the gut environment In this article we will discuss these findings and particularly explore the unique mechanisms governing resident and recruited inflammatory gut macrophage function Location and functions of resident macrophages in the healthy gut The largest population of resident macrophages in the body is present in the intestine They are found along the entire length of the intestine from the proximal small intestine to the distal large intestine and are enriched in the lamina propria close to the epithelial layer Fig There is also a morphologically distinct population present in the smooth muscle layers Along the length of the gut the number of macrophages varies with the highest density found in the colon of both humans and rodents Fig Development and functions of resident intestinal macrophages In the healthy gut hi monocytes are constantly recruited from the blood into the gut to replenish the resident macrophage pool hi monocytes transit through a series of phenotypically defined stages to eventually become mature hi MHCII hi low macrophages in the lamina propria and muscularis These macrophages are hyporesponsive to bacterial ligands constitutively produce and have multiple crucial functions in gut homeostasis including Treg expansion epithelial maintenance luminal sampling and bacterial killing As in most tissues a key role of macrophages in the gut is to perform housekeeping functions such as tissue remodelling and removal of senescent or dying cells In line with this function they have high expression of scavenger receptors including that are able to support apoptotic cell uptake They are also able to produce soluble factors that can help to support epithelial barrier integrity such as the lipid mediator prostaglandin E Additionally macrophages located in the muscularis and serosa are important in interacting with nerves to support peristalsis ensuring ongoing movement of ingested material along the intestine However alongside these homeostatic functions macrophages in the gut are also important immune sentinels and effector populations The positioning of LP macrophages in close apposition to the epithelial layer means that they are able to rapidly uptake and respond to any material breaching this barrier These resident macrophages are highly phagocytic and have bactericidal properties They can also produce chemokines to recruit effector cells from the blood into the tissue when required Intriguingly unlike other studied macrophage populations in the body although gut macrophages can respond to bacteria they do not induce classic responses This is a critical feature to prevent aberrant inflammation towards the high commensal bacterial load For example ingestion of bacteria does not lead to enhanced respiratory burst activity and ligation of receptors or oligomerisation domain receptors does not result in increased or production Despite this hyporesponsive phenotype towards bacteria intestinal macrophages are not completely unresponsive in their capacity and they constitutively produce the cytokine and low levels of Although this production of may at first seem counterintuitive to its inflammatory can impact enterocyte growth as well as modulating production of matrix metalloproteinases from intestinal mesechymal cells actions which are suggested to allow gut macrophages to support the maintenance of barrier homeostasis An important component of the gut immune system that is critical in establishing tolerance towards the high burden of food and commensal antigens is the forkhead box protein T regulatory cell network Since gut macrophages are able to uptake orally acquired antigens and also express high levels of major histocompatibility complex class II it is not surprising that they are suggested to play a key role in supporting development of this network Of note Hadis et al demonstrated that following their priming in the lymph node Tregs that had trafficked to the LP were maintained at this site by macrophages A similar role for macrophages in contributing to the Treg pool has also been suggested in the lung It is possible that gut macrophages may play roles in supporting maintenance of other T cell subsets in the gut In particular macrophages can produce following TLR stimulation and this has been suggested to support cell development in the healthy gut Along these lines recruited macrophages have also been shown to support generation of cells Although cells are key mediators of barrier defence dysregulated responses are a driver of colitogenic pathology and in settings of gastrointestinal inflammation macrophages have been shown to support amplification of responses Further studies will be required to establish whether macrophage education of gastrointestinal T cell populations requires cognate cell receptor interactions or whether the cytokine milieu established by macrophages is the major factor Moreover the influence of macrophages on other lymphocyte populations during steady state requires further assessment especially in the light of reports detailing lymphoid cell interactions which are key to support gastrointestinal immune homeostasis and reinforce barrier integrity Another way in which gut macrophages may be able to support development of the gut T cell network in an indirect manner is by transfer of soluble antigen from the lumen to gut dendritic cells These DCs then drain to the mesenteric lymph nodes to prime T cell responses It is still not entirely clear how LP macrophages acquire these luminal antigens but one possibility is that they can extend transepithelial dendrites across the epithelium However this idea remains controversial with original reports disagreeing on which parts of the small intestine these transepithelial dendrites were present in and the necessity for TLR signalling and subsequent studies unable to identify them An issue that has confounded functional studies of gut macrophages has been the complexities of identifying this population using flow cytometry Initially this problem largely arose due to the assumption that and MHCII were markers of gut DCs In the gut LP macrophages express high levels of as well as MHCII and thus in many studies were assumed to be DCs Unlike macrophages DC constantly drain from tissue to lymph nodes where their major role is to prime T cells More recently the fractalkine receptor has been used to distinguish gut macrophages from gut DC Notably resident gut macrophages express high levels of however some subsets of gut DC also express this marker at an intermediate which may be the basis of more recent contradictory findings regarding DC and macrophage function One problem with using high expression of as a marker of gut macrophages is that this can currently only be established using transgenic mice and not by antibody staining A more useful strategy for identifying gut macrophages by multicolour flow cytometry can be used in non expressing came from genomic datasets alongside more targeted studies Together these publications have identified that and MHCII used in combination with and lineage exclusion markers g for lymphocytes and can reliably define these cells expression was found to be of particular relevance to distinguish LP macrophages hi from those in the serosa and muscularis low When isolated by cell sorting these cells exhibit characteristic macrophage morphology and cannot be found draining to the mesenteric lymph nodes Moreover their development is critically dependent on colony stimulating factor receptor known as macrophage factor receptor but independent of the DC growth factor tyrosine kinase ligand Altogether these findings suggest that and are bona fide markers of macrophages and will support researchers in specifically determining gut macrophage functions in future studies The unusual ontogeny of resident gut macrophages When the mononuclear phagocyte system was first described just over years ago it was proposed that tissue macrophages were the terminal differentiation stage of blood monocytes after recruitment into tissue However in more recent years a number of studies have been published that demonstrate that the majority of tissue macrophages are able to exist independently of blood monocyte precursors Frequently these derive from foetal liver precursors although some including the microglia of the central nervous system come from the yolk sac These cells seed tissues prenatally and then are maintained by local proliferation Resident macrophages include those of the lung alveoli the Kuppfer cells of the liver and epidermal Langerhans cells The adult intestinal macrophage pool is a major exception to this rule with the dermis and more controversially the heart fitting the original MPS model requiring constant replenishment from blood monocytes Fig Blood monocytes are a heterogeneous circulating population in both humans and mice that originate in the bone marrow In mice there is a subset that expresses high levels of and termed monocytes equivalent of human hi monocytes that are the precursors to the adult intestinal macrophages Although at birth there are embryonically derived macrophages present in the gut around the time of weaning these are replaced by cells derived from an influx of hi monocytes A number of studies investigating macrophage differentiation in the healthy gut have been instrumental in defining the phenotypic and transcriptional profile of classical hi blood monocytes transitioning into mature gut macrophages Initially using an adoptive transfer approach in healthy gut it was shown that hi monocytes were able to enter into the colon and mature into hi hi MHCII macrophages This developmental process involves a series of identifiable intermediaries in which expression is lost while expression of and are gained Due to the visual appearance of this transition moving from hi to MHCII hi or hi on a flow cytometry plot this has been referred to as the monocyte to macrophage Differentiation takes approximately days and results in a cell that has increased phagocytic capacity and constitutive production and is anergic to TLR stimulation This rapid differentiation is in line with earlier reports of an approximately for macrophages Although the precise mechanisms governing differentiation cannot be easily established in humans resident gut macrophages deriving from blood monocytes is implied by a similar waterfall of hi characteristic of classical monocytes to low hi hi cells The complex commensal flora is a distinguishing feature of the intestine and there is a current consensus that it is this feature that is important in regulating the continuous replenishment of resident gut macrophages from blood monocytes Of note there is a first accumulation of colonic macrophages between and weeks of age in mice that is concurrent with increased commensal colonisation Corroborating the importance of the microbiome in this process at weeks of age there were fewer mature macrophages in mice than conventionally housed controls Moreover many of these macrophages did not express MHCII further implicating the microbiome in typical differentiation of macrophages as well as recruitment It is worth noting however that this was not the first study to investigate colonic macrophage abundancy in animals and these studies have reached opposing conclusions Animals from different sources are now well known to have very different commensal composition One hypothesis for these differences between studies is that there are unique factors in the gut other than the microbiome that can affect macrophage replacement from blood monocytes but that specific bacterial species present in certain mouse colonies can enhance or decrease the turnover rate Taken together the studies to date strongly suggest that in both mice and humans and in stark contrast to other tissues resident gut macrophages are continuously replenished from circulating blood monocytes Whether this information can be used to design strategies to specifically target gut macrophages remains to be explored but suggests that they may be impacted by systemic drug administration in a way that macrophages maintained locally in tissue would not Instruction of resident gut macrophage function The main cues present in the gut environment that are responsible for monocyte to resident macrophage differentiation are still poorly defined However it is likely that there are specific signals or combinations of signals in the gut that induce characteristics not observed at other mucosal sites such as the skin and lung There are a number of important growth factors involved in the establishment of the MPS notably and macrophage Although and may have impacts on gut macrophage function they appear to be dispensable for their development This is in stark contrast to lung macrophages for which signalling is extremely important Two ligands have been identified for itself and It seems most likely that development and maintenance of macrophages in the gut are dependent as there is a marked reduction of macrophages in mice that have a mutation in the gene that encodes op op or following administration of antibody One particularly unusual phenotype of resident gut macrophages is their acquisition of high levels of expression In the majority of tissues is downregulated on macrophages suggesting that there is a factor in the gut responsible for its continued expression A recent study has suggested that which is established to induce expression in the brain is also a dominant signal for expression by gut macrophages This is in line with the identification of as a characteristic transcription factor of gut macrophages that is regulated by in T cells In addition it is possible that the interaction of with may be important itself in instructing gut macrophage function For example it has been suggested that interactions are critical for optimal production of by macrophages signalling is one pathway that has been shown to be crucial for instructing macrophage function in the gastrointestinal mucosa Not only do macrophages make but signals to the macrophage are vital for the appropriate education of intestinal macrophage populations providing a key cue that safeguards their hyporesponsive phenotype It has long been known that in the absence of severe gastrointestinal inflammation results what is now clear is that receptor signalling on macrophages but not the production of itself is key in restraining this inflammation When unable to respond to gut macrophages produce increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial stimulation and drive development of colitis More recently specific deletion of on gut macrophages was shown to lead to the development of a spontaneous and severe ulcerative GI inflammation Part of this conditioning of macrophage function has been reported to include limiting levels of PGE inflammasome components and Thus signals have emerged as a vital restraint against overt macrophage activation Interestingly this pathway has also been implicated in early onset IBD as similar functional alterations to those seen in animal models have been observed in patients with mutations As mentioned another key feature of gut macrophages is their apparent hyporesponsiveness to activation Intriguingly macrophages both in humans and mice express a full repertoire of TLR receptors so it is thought that it is downstream mediators that are responsible for the hyporesponsiveness Of note molecules including TRIF and are downregulated in mature macrophages Additionally there may be alternative pathways that impair TLR responsiveness for example through increased expression of and An emerging mediator of gut macrophage function is neuroendocrine signals controlling macrophage survival and phenotype within the highly innervated gastrointestinal mucosa interactions are bidirectional with macrophages in the muscularis capable of controlling peristaltic activity Bone morphogenetic protein produced by macrophages acts on enteric neurons to control smooth muscle contractions and thus peristalsis In return neuroendocrine signals to macrophages support maintenance of macrophage populations within specific gastrointestinal niches Bogunovic and colleagues demonstrated that enteric neurons ensure maintenance of macrophages specifically within the muscularis layer of the gastrointestinal tract through production of discussed a key growth factor in gut macrophage This neuroendocrine control of macrophage survival was downstream of commensal bacteria colonisation as signals promoted enteric neuron expression of Additional macrophage niche specialisation by neuroendocrine pathways can also be driven by norepinephrine signals from sympathetic neurons Muscarlis macrophages express adrenergic receptors that upon binding of norepinephrine released from local active neurons promote acquisition of a programme in macrophages during infection Intriguingly and in line with microbial activation of production from enteric neurones it has also been reported that the microbiota controls glial cell homeostasis in the intestine These supporting cells provide key maintenance and protection for neurons further highlighting the complex integration of microbial endocrine and immune signals in controlling GI immune homeostasis and inflammation The very recent focus on neuroendocrine signals in control of immune cell function within the gut will likely yield further insights into tissue training of macrophage function by these signals In addition to the signals described there are many other factors expressed in the gut environment that may play important roles on macrophages but as yet have been poorly explored These factors include thymic stromal lymphopoietin the mucus layer itself that has been shown to modify DC function and retinoic acid Retinoic acid is particularly intriguing as it is known to have profound effects on DC in the gut and in tandem with support induction of Treg The impact of RA on macrophages has yet to be precisely elucidated Inflammatory gut macrophages in experimental settings of classical inflammation Infiltration of classical hi monocytes that differentiate rapidly into effector cells is a common feature following intestinal damage and infection of mice Fig Perhaps the murine models of this are colitis induced by administration of dextran sodium sulphate and T cell transfer colitis In both of these settings there is a characteristic reversal in the composition of the macrophage compartment In particular hi gut macrophages that dominate in the healthy gut are outcompeted by int mononuclear phagocytes that are the progeny of rapidly infiltrating hi monocytes Precise definitions of the functions of this MNP pool are complex and the cells within this pool are on a differentiation spectrum that likely includes populations with more or functions For the rest of this review focus will be placed on the features of these cells that are present in inflammation that for clarity will be referred to as inflammatory macrophages the reader should note and as will be discussed that their functional and differentiation potential as well as morphology is very different to resident gut These cells have a strong signature characterised by the production of factors including and inducible nitric oxide synthase Of note despite their presence in this milieu the resident hi macrophages continue to maintain the largely characteristics they exhibit in health Not surprisingly given their features there is strong evidence for a pathologic role for the int macrophages in these murine models of colitis For example in mice have a paucity of cells in circulation and tissues due to a failure in classical monocyte release from the bone marrow or animals depleted of cells there is an amelioration of colitic inflammation Fig Macrophages during gut inflammation Following epithelial damage or pathogen invasion classical effector cells are elicited and enter the now inflamed GI tract The functions of these populations are poorly defined but likely highly specialised to the precise challenge and may include activities Many differentiate into macrophages that are crucial for pathogen control but can also lead to pathology as a result of their potential to produce inflammatory cytokines such as During T gondii infection these cells also take on the capacity to suppress neutrophil activation via release of PGE Of note during T gondii infection instruction of macrophage function begins in the bone marrow resulting in monocytes entering the tissue in a primed state characterised by their low expression of and high expression of MHCII Although monocytes no longer differentiate to resident macrophages hi lamina propria and muscularis during inflammation those present prior to barrier breach remain in the tissue and continue to exhibit features One intriguing feature of the hi monocyte differentiation pathway to inflammatory macrophages during colitis is the apparent concurrent impairment in hi monocyte differentiation to resident hi macrophages Indeed it has been proposed that this arrest in the differentiation pathway may underlie the ongoing capacity of inflammatory macrophages to respond to TLR stimulation in DSS colitis The precise mechanisms that result in such changes are currently unknown but are likely due to signals being altered in the local microenvironment that are critical for educating monocytes to become resident macrophages Despite inflammatory macrophages playing immunopathogenic roles during acute inflammation in certain gastrointestinal infections they are crucial for pathogen protection Following oral inoculation with the highly type polarising intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii there is dramatic infiltration of hi monocytes into the inflamed small intestine Once again the importance of monocytes in this setting can be revealed by the fact that mice or those deficient in its ligand fail to control the parasite and this can be restored by monocyte transfer Although this parasite control was initially attributed to the capacity of recently recruited macrophages to produce cytokines such as and iNOS their function has since been revealed to be more complex Our studies demonstrated that in animals infected with T gondii neutrophils became hyperactivated in the lamina propria of the gut where they produced dramatically increased levels of tissue damaging factors including and reactive oxygen species This was associated with increased severity of gastrointestinal pathology that was independent of increases in parasite load Immunofluorescent imaging revealed that hi inflammatory macrophages localised closely with neutrophils in the inflamed gut suggesting that one explanation for their enhanced activity might be direct suppressive actions of hi macrophages Supporting this idea we found that treatment of neutrophils with factors released from hi macrophages isolated from T gondii guts limited the capacity to produce factors in response to TLR ligands and formyl peptides Further experiments revealed that this effect was entirely dependent on the release of the lipid mediator PGE which is highly expressed by inflammatory macrophages during T gondii infection Fig This lipid mediator can have complex and opposing roles over the course of an inflammatory response as it can favour inflammatory cell recruitment but is also a potent suppressor of human neutrophil activation Following its initial invasion of the gut T gondii infection eventually disseminates systemically and inflammatory macrophages infiltrate lymphoid tissues including the spleen However the activity was only evident in macrophages isolated from the gut Studies using mice revealed that this was critically dependent on ligands The precise bacteria involved in instructing macrophage function during inflammation are likely very different to those resident macrophages are exposed to in health Notably in the context of gut infection there is tremendous outgrowth of potentially pathogenic commensal populations specifically such as Escherichia coli Outgrowth of has also been reported in patients with IBD Indeed in vitro treatment of circulating hi monocytes from the blood of T gondii animals with a lysate from a commensal form of E coli led to rapid PGE production Of course in vivo there may be additional signals responsible for initiating PGE release For example stimulated epithelial cells can produce and activate a strong driver of PGE from macrophages and dietary ligands such as short chain fatty acids can also augment PGE production It is interesting to speculate that in certain individuals or at defined time points during infection alterations in the composition of commensal species may be able to favour acquisition of regulatory features by infiltrating monocytes Another mechanism by which inflammatory macrophages may act to suppress immune cells during inflammation is via actions on T cells This could be achieved by modifying metabolism as nitric oxide limits T cell proliferation Inflammatory macrophages in the GI tract during acute infection and inflammation have been shown to be positive for this immune mediator In the spleen during Listeria monocytogenes infection iNOS macrophages suppress T cell responses Given the prevalence of iNOS macrophages in the GI tract during inflammation these data imply that these cells may well be capable of suppressing effector T cell responses in the GI mucosa In line with this a MNP in the GI tract has been shown to be capable of limiting T cell proliferation This required contact highlighting another mechanism that could be employed by macrophages to curtail gastrointestinal T cell responses Macrophages in human gut inflammation Mechanistic understanding of macrophages in human gut inflammation is much more limited than in animal models One thing that is clear is that hi MNP accumulate in the inflamed gut in settings such as IBD likely in response to elevated levels of the chemokines and Indeed by radiolabelling of autologous blood monocytes it was demonstrated that the hi cells arise from these circulating precursors These cells are the human equivalent of the hi populations in mice that become dominant during induced colitis and oral T gondii infection As with recruited macrophages in the mouse the hi cells in the inflamed human intestine produce high levels of and and have ongoing responsiveness to factors In addition to cytokine release it has also been reported that macrophages in the inflamed mucosa have increased expression of that may support local interactions with effector T cells again mirroring data from murine models Given the currently sparse data on human intestinal macrophage function but their high relevance to disease pathology this will no doubt be an area for tremendous future scientific study The already strong similarities between patient samples and murine models suggest that integration of these two investigative strategies may be key to rapidly progressing our knowledge of this area instruction of inflammatory gut macrophage function during infection At steady state much research focus has been placed on the cues present in the gut environment that locally instruct resident gut macrophage differentiation Based on this model during gut inflammation factors at the affected tissue site to which macrophages are exposed have been of primary interest However a number of recent findings including those from our group suggest that a more holistic approach to understanding macrophage differentiation during inflammation needs to be employed It is well established that when stressed tissues such as the gut can send signals to the bone marrow niche and blood to improve supply of required circulating immune populations We found that during gut infection these signals can also instruct for altered functional potential As early as days after oral infection with T gondii hi monocytes developing in the BM niche acquired a characteristic low MHCII hi hi phenotype which was also observed in inflammatory gut macrophages suggesting that instruction of eventual macrophage differentiation may be beginning in the BM Most importantly when highly pure BM hi monocytes were isolated by FACS from and T gondii animals and exposed to commensal signals they ultimately would experience in the inflamed gut they already had enhanced capacity to produce PGE prior to BM efflux As discussed already we have established PGE as a critical recruited gut factor regulating immunopathology during oral T gondii infection Thus during gut infection functional priming of inflammatory macrophages can begin in the BM Although PGE production was highlighted the hi monocytes had profound transcriptional changes and also had enhanced capacity to produce in response to bacterial ligands These transcriptional changes were at least initiated in the direct proliferative precursor to monocytes the common monocyte progenitor but earlier progenitors such as the MDP were not investigated due to issues of identification in infection The precise mechanisms that the gut can use to communicate to the BM niche are not understood During T gondii infection we identified a whole organism signalling loop in which a specific subset of gut DC released the cytokine in the serum that was detected by a subset of mature natural killer cells present in the BM These NK cells produced locally in the BM in response to the signal which was critical in generating the high PGE low MHCII hi hi monocytes Although was a dominant signal whether additional signals in the BM environment are also altered following T gondii infection and whether these have specific functional effects on developing monocytes and eventually their gut macrophage progeny remain unknown One possibility is ligands such as fatty acids as these have previously been shown to modify DC function prior to exit from the BM in an asthma model Intriguingly during T gondii infection our data suggested that perturbations to differentiation capacity might be initiated systemically as there were dramatic increases in circulating hi monocytes with a concurrent loss of low patrolling monocytes are suggested to derive from the hi population This bears striking similarity to the proposed block in differentiation of monocytes to resident gut macrophages in colitis The cytokine was implicated in this process but further work will be needed to confirm whether this is due to an arrest in normal differentiation pathways than for example increased BM output of hi and whether these hi monocytes are also unable to differentiate into resident macrophages upon entry into the gut Resident and inflammatory macrophages in resolution of inflammation Once the infection or other factor has been cleared or becomes tolerated in the gut there must be a resolution phase to restore homeostasis If this does not happen then chronic inflammation may develop As occurs during inflammation this resolution phase is also associated with striking alterations to gut macrophage subsets One example of this is that following resolution of DSS colitis in mice the augmented int MNP subset returns to baseline levels Precise reasons for the loss of the int subset are not known but apoptosis and uptake by resident macrophages seem probable An alternative possibility based on the idea that int cells are blocked in their differentiation to resident gut macrophages during inflammation is that due to alterations in the cytokine milieu this limitation is removed As a result many of the int cells would from the gut by differentiating into resident gut macrophages Whatever the case it seems that gut monocytes macrophages are important in gut repair and resolution of inflammation In particular there is a delay in DSS colitis resolution in animals that lack signalling on monocytes macrophages while deletion of signalling in myeloid cells limits gut healing Although not well studied specifically in the gut one set of factors that are important in restoration of homeostasis in all tissues are lipid mediators These factors as well as limiting influx of additional inflammatory cells can promote the uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages Types of lipid mediators include lipoxins resolvins and protectins that can be produced by multiple cell types including macrophages One factor that has been demonstrated to favour production of lipoxins is prostaglandins in particular PGE For example in resolving inflammatory exudates it has been suggested that PGE and PGD can stimulate production of a functional enzyme for lipoxin in neutrophils Based on our studies in T gondii infection this raises the intriguing possibility that hi monocytes macrophages not only limit neutrophil activation but also deviate their function towards a state Relating to this macrophages may also be able to regulate wound healing directly by interacting with epithelial progenitor cells during colonic wound healing Again lipid mediators may play a role in this process as expression a critical factor in PGE production has been linked to protection of progenitor populations at other tissue sites during inflammation As well as repairing the barrier another feature of return to homeostasis is the restoration of the adaptive immune compartment which can become dramatically perturbed during an inflammatory response At this time it is unclear how the mononuclear phagocytes of the gut may act together to support this return but given their suggested role in expanding Tregs at steady state it is likely that macrophages are important to this process With the recent advances in technologies for the generation of transgenic murine systems novel tools for the temporal knockout of specific genes in defined macrophage monocyte subsets are likely to become increasingly available This will allow candidate factors identified as being important to resolution to be depleted during this phase of the inflammatory response without impairing initiation of disease Already the creER mouse that knocks out factors in hi gut macrophages holds much promise for this purpose Concluding remarks Utilising novel transgenic animals alongside cytometric and genomic approaches recent years have seen an explosion in our understanding of macrophage biology in general and more specifically in the gut In particular the field is beginning to better define the diverse functions that these cells play in tissue homeostasis and how they can be manipulated in disease states With the advent of RNA sequencing it will become more straightforward to define functionally distinct macrophage subsets within complex and potentially inflamed tissue environments One aspect of macrophage biology that has been largely overlooked in recent years is precise localisation within the tissue For example in the gastrointestinal tract there are diverse structural components to the tissue e g muscle nerves blood vessels and epithelium How macrophage function might be tailored to each of these niches is only just beginning to be understood Another area in the functional diversity arena is to further understand the differential roles of resident macrophages versus inflammatory macrophages in disease states It is clear that resident macrophages are often maintained in the inflammatory environment but are not acquiring classical activation markers Whether these cells play a role during the active inflammatory event or in restoring homeostasis post challenge is extremely unclear This is critical to understand as it would help elucidate specific macrophage factors that can be manipulated at defined time points in the inflammation resolution cycle to alter outcome Whatever the future of macrophage research holds given the importance of intestinal macrophages to the maintenance of homeostasis and disease progression better understanding the development and functions of this cell type will no doubt yield novel strategies that can inform development of therapies to improve patient outcome in inflammatory diseases such as IBD This article is part of the special issue on macrophages

behaviour present in different psychiatric disorders such as disorder schizophrenia and drug abuse is associated with altered levels of monoamines particularly serotonin and its receptor system Objectives The present study investigated whether manipulation through a tryptophan depletion by diet in Wistar and Lister Hooded rats modulates compulsive drinking in polydipsia and locomotor activity in the test The levels of dopamine noradrenaline serotonin and its metabolite were evaluated as well as the and receptor binding in different brain regions Methods Wistar rats were selected as high or low drinkers according to their SIP behaviour while Lister hooded rats did not show SIP acquisition Both strains were fed for days with either a diet or a diet Results The TRP depletion diet effectively reduced levels in the frontal cortex amygdala and hippocampus in both strains of rats The HD Wistar rats were more sensitive to manipulation exhibiting more licks on SIP than did the HD Wistar rats while the LD Wistar and the Lister Hooded rats did not exhibit differences in SIP In contrast the Lister Hooded rats increased locomotor activity compared to the rats while no differences were found in the Wistar rats Serotonin receptor binding in the striatum was significantly reduced in the HD Wistar rats Conclusions These results suggest that alterations of the serotonergic system could be involved in compulsive behaviour in vulnerable populations Keywords Compulsivity Inhibitory control Chronic tryptophan depletion polydipsia Monoamines binding Berlin Heidelberg Introduction Compulsivity represents the performance of repetitive and functionally impairing overt or covert behaviours without adaptive function performed in a habitual or stereotyped fashion either according to rigid rules or as a means of avoiding perceived negative consequences et al Neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by compulsivity are included in the newly created Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition and related cluster such as disorder body dysmorphic disorder trichotillomania hair hoarding disorder and excoriation Psychiatric Association Moreover this behaviour is also present across different disorders such as schizophrenia hyperactivity disorder pathological gambling eating disorders depression or substance addiction and Oldham Dysfunctions in circuits involving areas such as mOFC amygdala and hippocampus have been associated with the symptomatology in OCD and Robbins and Marra Evidence from animal and human studies implicates the serotonin system in impulsivity and compulsivity and Baunez Fineberg et al Mice lacking the gene encoding brain tryptophan hydroxylase the initial and enzyme in synthesis showed intense impulsive and compulsive behaviours to include extreme aggression et al Moreover studies on depletion by excitotoxic lesions in rats have revealed an increase of perseverative responding in the serial reaction time task et al impairment of behavioural flexibility measured through the reversal learning task et al et al Wallace et al and an increment of compulsive cocaine seeking under punishment et al A and more naturalistic method to reduce central is through nutritional depletion of the precursor tryptophan Under normal physiological conditions the biosynthesis of is limited by the availability of the essential amino acid TRP Gessa et al Rats receiving a diet reduced the synthesis content et al and release et al b While acute tryptophan depletion by diet produced a moderate serotonergic reduction in adult rats et al Lieben et al chronic tryptophan depletions have shown stronger effects reducing brain levels to at days et al and to at exposures and Kempf Moreover diets lead to changes in serotonergic receptors in animals increasing serotonin receptor density but having no effect on serotonin receptor et al Franklin et al Behavioural studies in rodents have demonstrated that a TRP depletion by diet increased aggressiveness and Kempf locomotor activity and Kempf and sexual behaviour et al The increase of these behaviours may suggest a lack of inhibitory control leading to compulsive behaviour However only one study has evaluated the effect of acute TRP depletion on some facets of compulsivity showing no effects on behavioural flexibility in reversal learning or in an extinction paradigm der Plasse and Feenstra Thus the effects of chronic TRP depletion by diet on compulsivity remain unknown Because of its characteristics of and polydipsia is a useful model to study neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of compulsive behaviour Gilpin et al Hawken et al Hawken and Beninger for review see Moreno and Flores The SIP model is characterized by the development of excessive drinking in animals exposed to intermittent food reinforcement schedules Important differences between individuals in the amount of fluid intake and licks support the differentiation of two phenotypes of rats one with high or excessive drinking and a second group with low or not SIP acquisition et al Recent data have shown that HD animals present increased levels of and metabolites in the amygdala compared to the LD group et al In addiction the systemic administration of citalopram and the serotonin C receptor agonist reduced compulsive drinking in HD rats without affecting the drinking behaviour of LD rats et al All those data point out the involvement of system in the vulnerability to the development of compulsive drinking between HD and LD rats In our laboratory Wistar rats are commonly used in SIP showing individual differences between HD and LD phenotypes However no previous studies have tested the differences between Wistar and Lister Hooded rats in SIP acquisition In fact behavioural differences in inhibitory control have been observed between these two strains of rats Wistar rats compared to Lister Hooded rats show more anticipatory responses in a serial reaction time task and more food hoarding behaviour and Uylings indicating a poorer inhibitory control of this strain and a higher vulnerability to develop compulsive drinking on SIP We hypothesised that a reduction of through a chronic TRP depletion by diet will increase the compulsive behaviour in vulnerable populations such as the HD Wistar rats compared to populations such as LD Wistar rats and Lister Hooded rats and that could be accompanied by changes in the serotonin receptor a serotonin receptor subtype proposed as a candidate for mediating compulsive behaviour and Hervig Aznar and Klein Fineberg et al Navarro et al To test the previous hypothesis we screened high and low drinking rates during SIP in both strains Next we produced a dysfunction of the system in the brain by a chronic TRP depletion by diet and evaluated possible motor disruptions or hyperactivity in an test and the effect on compulsive drinking on SIP Then brain monoamine levels and serotonin and receptor densities were measured in different brain regions of the circuits associated with compulsivity Methods Subjects Two strains of rats were used for this experiment adult male Lister Hooded rats from Charles River and adult male Wistar rats from Harlan Iberica Both strains of rats weighed approximately g at the beginning of the experiment The animals were housed three cage or two cage at with cycle with food and water available ad libitum Before the SIP training and after days of habituation to the vivarium conditions the rats were weighed and handled daily They were gradually reduced to of their body weight by controlled feeding and then maintained at this level of deprivation throughout the experiment Food was made available by daily feeding of lab chow approximately min after each experimental session Water was always available in the home cages Rats were assigned to each experimental group taking into consideration the amount of water consumed in the previous experimental SIP in order to match all groups The Wistar rats were split as following high drinkers receiving a diet n high drinkers receiving a control diet n low drinkers with a diet n and low drinkers with a control diet n The Lister Hooded rats as they did not show differences in SIP intake and were divided into two groups depending on the diet One group n received a diet while the other group n received a control diet Once the animals started the specific diets they were housed in cages individually to control body weight All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Spanish Royal Decree on the protection of experimental animals with the European Community Council Directives and with the University of Animal Research Committee approval Experimental design The experiment was developed in two phases One previous phase consisted of screening the acquisition of SIP in the Lister Hooded and Wistar rats Once the rats were identified as high drinkers or low drinkers by their SIP behaviour they were divided into groups depending on the given diet After days of TRP depletion by diet the rats were exposed to different behavioural tasks The order of presentation was as follows one session of the test and six sessions of SIP Fig for the entire experimental Fig Experimental procedure illustrated in a timetable Apparatus and behavioural procedures polydipsia We conducted the tests in ten standard operant conditioning chambers that were cm long cm wide cm high with stainless steel grid floors A detailed description of the apparatus has been provided previously for the SIP et al Moreno et al The scheduling and recording of experimental events were controlled by a Med PC computer and commercial software SA Baseline consumption All rats were individually housed in plastic cages containing a dish with the same amount of food to be delivered in the experimental sessions and the same water bottle used in the operant chambers Over two successive days food pellets were placed together in a dish and the amount of water consumed by each rat in min was measured Magazine habituation The day after the first baseline consumption sessions rats were habituated to the test chambers for min and were given food pellets placed in the food magazine polydipsia After the magazine habituation the animals were exposed to a fixed time schedule of food pellet presentation during sessions Water bottles containing ml of fresh water were provided immediately before each session After daily sessions the average water drinking for each animal was calculated based on the last three SIP sessions Following Moreno et al protocol rats are classified as high drinkers and low drinkers if their average water intake was above or below the group median respectively The following measures were recorded for each rat total number of licks total amount of water removed from the bottle total number of magazine entries and licking efficiency which was calculated as the total number of licks by the total solution consumed Lick efficiency detects possible fine motor impairments or changes in the stereotypic manner of licking which indicates with higher score values that the animal needs more total number of licks to obtain the same amount of target solution and Mittleman polydipsia After days of the TRP depletion diet the animals were exposed again to a schedule of food pellet presentation during sessions Water bottles with fresh water were available Spontaneous locomotor activity The test was an test performed in eight Plexiglas activity cages equipped with photocell beams interfaced to a microcomputer VersaMax Animal Activity Monitoring System Instruments Inc Spontaneous locomotor activity was measured as the number of photocell beam breaks due to the movements of the animals and rats were tested for their locomotor responses to a novel environment in the activity cages Rats were not habituated to the activity cages prior to this test Spontaneous locomotor behaviour was quantified in blocks over a period following placement into the test cage We measured total distance counted as the number of centimetres travelled by the animal indicator of ambulatory Tryptophan depletion diet The diet Harlan Laboratories S A Barcelona had a standard nutritional value but with a complete lack of TRP The control groups were fed a similar diet containing a standard amount of TRP g kg Harlan Laboratories S A Barcelona A chronic diet exposure of days was given before the behavioural tasks as previous studies have established et al Franklin et al Stancampiano et al and the amount of food was controlled in order to maintain the body weight at of their body weight Brain analyses The day after the SIP the rats were rapidly decapitated using a guillotine Brains were quickly removed frozen and stored at The cerebral hemispheres were separated and each half was used either for measuring monoamines or for measuring serotonin receptor binding The hemispheres were counterbalanced Brain monoamine analyses For brain tissue preparation the samples were thawed sufficiently to enable dissection of the prefrontal cortex striatum nucleus accumbens hippocampus and amygdala et al These were weighed and homogenized in N perchloric acid with metabisulfite EDTA and ng ml cysteine The homogenates were centrifuged at rpm for min at and supernatants were collected and frozen at until biochemical analyses for determining the levels of norepinephrine dopamine serotonin and acid which were measured using liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection The mobile phase containing mM KH PO mM Na mM and methanol adjusted to pH with orthophosphoric acid was delivered at ml min Monoamines were separated on a particle size column at cm Micron Analitica SA Autoradiography To determine R and R binding in the Wistar and Lister Hooded rats their brains were cut in sections mounted on Super Frost slides and stored at The protocol was modified from Klein et al The autoradiography protocol was performed using activity TBq mmol Novandi Chemistry and binding was determined using ketanserin tartrate quinazolinedione Cookson Ltd Bristol For autoradiography we used activity TBq mmol Novandi and measured binding with Copenhagen Briefly the sections were allowed to thaw for h at room

femtomole per milligramme tissue equivalents Data analyses Data analyses of the different strains were performed separately due to the complexity of the groups Analyses of variance were performed with two factors for the Wistar strain data group and and treatment and and one factor for the Lister Hooded strain data and The factors were sessions of SIP bins on the locomotor activity body weight

present study has shown the effects of chronic TRP depletion by diet in two strains of rats Wistar and LH Before TRP depletion by diet we examined differences in the model of compulsive behaviour SIP and we found in the Wistar strain two groups of rats based on their drinking behaviour HD and LD while the LH strain did not show acquisition of compulsive drinking After the chronic TRP depletion by diet the HD group of Wistar rats increased their compulsive drinking based on the total number of licks but no changes in drinking behaviour were observed in either the LD Wistar or LH rats Conversely TRP depletion produced an increase in spontaneous locomotor activity only in LH rats while the Wistar rats were unaffected A reduction of striatal receptor binding was observed in depleted HD Wistar rats compared to HD Wistar rats while depleted LD Wistar rats were not affected by the TRP manipulation On the contrary depleted LH rats showed reduced binding of the receptor in the frontal cortex Monoamine measures confirmed that and the ratio were depleted in different brain regions in both Wistar and LH rats These results will be further discussed in terms of the relationship between serotonin and inhibitory control Acquisition of polydipsia and strain differences In the SIP procedure the exposure of the Wistar strain to an schedule of food delivery differentiated two populations based on the amount of drinking high and low drinkers The HD Wistar rats showed an increased volume of water intake and number of licks from session compared to the LD Wistar rats These results confirm previous studies in which consistent individual differences are found review see Moreno and Flores However the LH rats did not show an acquisition of SIP This study is the first to evaluate strain differences between Wistar and LH rats in SIP acquisition and the development of SIP drinking Regarding strain differences LH rats compared to Wistar rats show a higher inhibitory control measured by less anticipatory responses in the task and less food hoarding behaviour and Uylings Other strains exhibiting inhibitory control deficits have shown increased SIP behaviour For instance spontaneously hypertensive rats characterized as hyperactive and impulsive in terms of exacerbated sensitivity to delay of reinforcement displayed increased drinking in SIP compared to rats and as well as two rat lines selectively bred for high ethanol preference compared to their counterparts et al Moreover the selective breeding of Roman and rats for rapid vs extremely poor acquisition of active avoidance behaviour in a shuttle box resulted in two phenotypes that present differences in SIP acquisition et al RHA rats which show traits such as higher novelty seeking susceptibility to addictive drugs and impulse behaviours in the task and serial reaction time task et al Fattore et al Moreno et al also display increased SIP acquisition compared to RLA rats Thus SIP seems to be sensitive in distinguishing phenotypes of rats that have shown deficits in inhibitory control responses in different tasks of impulsivity compulsivity indicating a lack of inhibitory control as the main characteristic involved in the compulsive drinking in SIP and Flores Effect of chronic diet on polydipsia and possible mechanisms Chronic diet exposure increased the total number of licks in the HD Wistar rats without affecting the amount of water drunk on SIP We found similar observations in our laboratory of an increase in total licks on SIP after months of an acute chlorpyrifos administration et al There is evidence that CPF intoxication affects the serotonergic system et al Moreno et al possibly by inducing TRP hydroxylase the enzyme for biosynthesis and suppressing expression of transporter genes and Seidler Therefore a disruption in serotonin levels may be the underlying mechanism for the increased total licks observed on SIP On the other hand the increase in licks is because groups differ from session onward and not from session The effect of increasing the number of licks without affecting the amount of water intake also observed by Cardona et al may suggest a change of the drinking behaviour understood as an expression of compulsivity In this sense lick efficiency analyses showed differences in HD Wistar rats due to the TRP depletion by diet This result could be interpreted as an increase in the stereotypic compulsive manner of drinking by depleted HD rats and this increase is not due to motor problems since depleted LD Wistar and LH rats did not differ in lick efficiency The specific effect of the chronic TRP depletion increasing total licks and licking efficiency in HD Wistar rats but not in LD Wistar rats indicates a vulnerability of the HD group to compulsive symptoms and an implication of the serotonergic system mediating this vulnerability Only a few studies have tested the effect of acute TRP depletion in OCD patients showing not significant increases of obsessions or compulsions according to the scores of the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale at rest or following symptom provocation et al Berney et al However taking into account studies using neuropsychological tasks instead of questionnaires patients with psychopathologies from the spectrum seem to aggravate their symptoms when exposed to ATD For instance ATD increased omissions in the continuous performance task et al Zepf et al and aggressive behaviour in ADHD patients et al Stadler et al Zepf et al Zimmermann et al Interestingly ATD impaired go performance et al and stop signal reaction time et al in healthy men with family history of alcoholism and also increased commission errors in the go task in an aggressive subgroup of people with ADHD et al These findings suggest that ATD may reveal vulnerable systems in certain populations at risk of impulse control disorders and Deakin though it is still unknown precisely which receptor subtypes may lay behind this vulnerability In our study we found a reduction of striatal receptor density in HD Wistar rats compared to HD Wistar rats No differences were obtained in the LD Wistar or LH rats Alterations of receptor levels in depletion studies are controversial Several studies report upregulation of this receptor subtype in the hippocampus and frontal cortex et al Heal et al Seeman et al while other studies do not observe any difference et al Conn and Fischette et al In support of our findings Licht et al found that receptor binding was markedly reduced in striatum and prefrontal cortex regions after depletion Barlow et al had similar findings regarding the receptor reductions and low levels of in the orbitofrontal cortex in perseverative rats in the reversal learning task They furthermore reported differences in gene expression levels of the and enzymes They suggest that decreased MAO activity in the DRN resulted in reduced breakdown and consequently increased autoinhibition of neurons by somatodendritic receptors et al Liu et al The specific downregulation of the striatal receptor in HD but not LD rats by manipulation of the central system reveals a specific role of the receptor system in the observed increase in compulsive drinking on SIP Evidence from animal and human studies underlies a key role of the C receptors in compulsive symptoms et al Activation of prefrontal receptors has been proposed to underpin the anticompulsive effect of SSRIs et al for a review see El Mansari and Blier Westenberg et al antipsychotics may exacerbate compulsive behaviours in patients with schizophrenia and proposed to be through the potent antagonism et al In fact activation of the C by DOI reduces compulsive drinking on SIP and this reduction is blocked by the receptor antagonists ketanserin and but not by the receptor antagonist indicating that the receptor mediates the anticompulsive effect of DOI on SIP et al Moreover systemic administration of in rats impairs spatial reversal learning increasing perseverative responses et al Alterations in receptor levels have also been observed in Roman rats et al an inbred strain characterized by a compulsive drinking profile on SIP impulsivity on the task and poor inhibitory control in the task et al In humans neuroimaging studies have also linked differences in receptor levels to the development of compulsive spectrum disorders Positron emission tomography studies in OCD patients reveal a reduction in frontal cortex serotonin receptor availability et al with specific correlations between serotonin receptor availability in the orbitofrontal cortex and age of onset of the disorder et al Little is known regarding the contribution of the striatal serotonin receptor subtypes to cognitive function In the striatum receptors modulate the activity of DA GABA and glutamate neurotransmission and output regions of the basal ganglia and Brotchie suggesting a role of the system in regulating action selection and motor control Matteo et al More studies are needed to evaluate the role of the striatal receptor in the spectrum disorders Effect of chronic diet on spontaneous locomotor activity and possible mechanisms The chronic TRP depletion resulted in the LH strain in an increase in spontaneous locomotor activity not observed in the Wistar strain Contrary to our results previous studies with Wistar rats reported increases in locomotor activity after a exposure to a diet and Kempf Possibly the effect of TRP depletion by diet on locomotor activity depends on the severity of reductions based on the observations of greater global reductions of and its metabolite in LH but not in Wistar rats in our study In fact the increases of locomotor activity in Vergnes and study were found after a period of exposure to a diet in which of reductions in brain levels were observed However we have carried out an exposure of weeks that is similar to the chronic TRP treatment in Fadda et al study in which of reductions were found Moreover central depletion by administration of an invasive neurotoxic method that drastically reduces levels reported an increase in locomotor activity in LH rats et al On the other hand our results confirm previous observations of no differences in locomotor activity between the HD and LD Wistar rats et al Besides this effect depleted LH rats showed a downregulation of prefrontal receptor that was not observed in the depleted Wistar rats This is interesting as receptors seem to be less susceptible to changes in serotonergic tonus compared to other receptor subtypes based on several studies of lesions et al Frazer and Hensler Hensler et al Miquel et al Verge et al However Kawai et al proposed a downregulation of receptors in the frontal cortex as a homeostatic adaptive change in response to chronic TRP deprivation Effect of chronic diet on monoaminergic concentration levels Chronic TRP depletion was effective in reducing the levels of turnover ratio in prefrontal cortex striatum amygdala nucleus accumbens and hippocampus in both strains of rats In addition the serotonin metabolite was reduced in all cases with the exception of nucleus accumbens of the Wistar rats More variability was found when exploring significant reductions of which was effectively decreased in all areas but not in the striatum of the Wistar rats and the nucleus accumbens of both strains Previous studies have reported similar findings regarding significant reductions of serotonin and its metabolite in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus when challenging rats to a TRP depletion by diet et al Franklin et al Koot et al However there were strain differences as the LH rats showed additional changes in other monoamines such as DA which was increased in the nucleus accumbens and NE which was decreased in the prefrontal cortex not observed in the Wistar rats Alterations of DA and NA when depleting chronically TRP by diet were also observed by Koot et al in Wistar rats indicating that this depleting method of may possibly lead to alterations in other brain neurotransmitter systems In conclusion the primary findings of the present study highlight the contribution of serotonergic mechanisms in the compulsive drinking behaviour of rats on SIP in which the serotonin depletion by chronic exposure to a diet increased compulsive licking in HD Wistar rats compared to LD Wistar and LH rats on SIP Moreover the TRP depletion by diet produced a modulation of and receptor subtypes The depleted HD Wistar rats showed receptor reductions in the striatum which may underlie the increases in licking on SIP Changes in the receptor subtype may represent a good potential biomarker for the vulnerability to compulsive spectrum disorders and a new target in the development of new therapeutic strategies Acknowledgements The authors thank Luis Ruedas for his invaluable and continuous help and Hans Jensen

reliability and accuracy of skull STL models using different CT technologies Method One female and one male human cadaver head were imaged using row CT CT and two CT scanners Four medical engineers manually thresholded the bony structures on all CT images The lowest and highest selected mean threshold values and the default threshold value were used to generate skull STL models Geometric variations between all manually thresholded STL models were calculated Furthermore in order to calculate the accuracy of the manually and default thresholded STL models all STL models were

row to mm and to mm Conclusions This study demonstrates that manual threshold selection results in better STL models than default thresholding The use of CT and CT technology in its present form does not deliver reliable or accurate STL models for medical additive manufacturing New approaches are required that are based on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms Keywords Additive manufacturing Computed tomography Medical imaging Segmentation Thresholding VU University Medical Center CARS Introduction Additive manufacturing also known as printing refers to a process where a series of successive layers are laid down to create a construct AM combined with advanced medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has resulted in a paradigm shift in medicine from traditional serial production to constructs This combination of technologies offers new possibilities for the fabrication of implants saw guides and drill guides that are designed to meet the specific anatomical needs of patients Fig A schematic diagram of the three steps required to fabricate an AM medical construct The medical AM process begins with image acquisition Step which is commonly performed using a row computed tomography scanner However computed tomography which offers the possibility of acquiring CT images using two different spectra is becoming more common in hospital environments Furthermore computed tomography is being increasingly used in dentistry and maxillofacial surgery due to its low costs and reduced radiation dose when compared with MDCT scanners Images acquired using CT technologies are commonly saved as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files These files contain voxels with grey values that are proportional to the attenuation coefficient in the corresponding volume of the patient In MDCT these grey values are scaled according to Hounsfield units air water and compact bone In CBCT technology the degree of attenuation is scaled using grey values hence voxel values CBCT grey values are often arbitrary and do not correspond to MDCT HU values Furthermore a large variability in the grey values has been reported between different CBCT scanners At present medical AM requires the conversion of DICOM images into virtual surface models that are commonly saved as standard tessellation language files Step STL models are commonly used to design medical constructs using design software The conversion process requires the partitioning and hence the segmentation of voxels into different tissue types The most common segmentation method used to date is thresholding During the thresholding process all voxels with a grey value that is equal or greater than a selected threshold value t are included in a segmented volume using a binary mask M x y M x y I x y t I x y t where I x y denotes the grey value at coordinates x and y The medical image segmentation software packages available offer only a single default threshold value for compact bone soft tissue and cartilage However these default values are often not optimized for all types of MDCT DECT and CBCT images and do not take into account the variations in grey values between different scanners Therefore in most cases manual threshold selection is necessary to acquire an optimal STL model Threshold selection however still remains a subjective task especially in the head area due to the plethora of complex bony geometries Furthermore minor dislocations in the facial area can have an impact on patient function and aesthetic appearance Fig The effect of threshold selection on skull STL models At present there is a paucity of the literature on threshold selection in the head area for medical purposes Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the impact of manual and default threshold selection on the reliability and accuracy of skull STL models acquired using different MDCT and CBCT technologies Materials and methods One female and one male human cadaver head were anonymously provided by the Department of Anatomy VU University Medical Center Amsterdam The Netherlands The two heads were embedded in a novel embalming liquid for that produces near cadavers Ethical approval for this study was provided by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center Fig Outline of

Number of voxels Reconstruction kernel Boneplus Boneplus Soft Soft Standard Standard n a n a After CT image acquisition all DICOM files were imported into Osirix MD software Foundation Geneva This software is for primary diagnostics and is commonly used in medical AM Osirix MD software provides options for both manual and default threshold selection Four medical engineers were subsequently requested to manually select the optimal threshold value for bone in order to create an accurate STL model of the female and male skull hence facial bony structures Step All four engineers were blinded for their own results and those of others The manual threshold selection procedure was repeated after a interval in order to determine the variability and to calculate the mean threshold value In addition the variability and correlation coefficients were calculated using SPSS software version Chicago IL ICC ranges between and with corresponding to no agreement and corresponding to complete agreement In order to graphically represent the distribution of grey values in the manually selected and default threshold values histograms were plotted for each of the four CT scanners using MatLab software v MathWorks Natick Massachusetts Only the highest and lowest mean selected threshold values presented on the eight histograms were used to generate STL models Step The generated STL models were subsequently geometrically compared to each other using GOM Inspect software Inspect GOM mbH Braunschweig in order to calculate the variations between the highest and lowest threshold STL models Step Fig The mean threshold values selected by four medical engineers and the default threshold value are presented in histograms a h The of the histograms is set to a logarithmic scale Fig Geometric variations in mm between the highest and lowest thresholded STL models acquired using four different CT scanners also Fig In a final step all soft tissues were manually removed from the cadaver heads using standard dissection equipment e scrapers and by a highly experienced technician at the Department of Anatomy Manual removal was opted for since this procedure ensured minimal dimensional changes in the bony structures of the cadaver skulls The resulting dry female and male skulls were subsequently scanned using a GOM ATOS TM III optical scanner GmbH Braunschweig with an accuracy of mm to acquire a STL model of the skulls These STL models were subsequently superimposed on the STL models generated using the highest and lowest manually selected and default threshold values in order to calculate the accuracy of each thresholded STL model Step Fig Accuracy of all STL models of the female skull acquired using the lowest left and highest middle mean threshold value selected by the four engineers and the default threshold value of HU right The arrows indicate missing data c f or excessive noise i in the default threshold STL models Results The and reliability results of all manually selected threshold values are presented in Table All selected threshold values ranged from to HU for the MDCT and DECT technologies and from to gv for the CBCT technologies As shown in the histograms all the selected threshold values differed from the default threshold value provided by Osirix MD software Furthermore the geometric variations between the highest and lowest thresholded STL models were larger in the STL models derived from DECT and CBCT when compared with the STL models When compared to the all manually and automatically thresholded STL models demonstrated inaccuracies ranging from to mm to mm and to mm for all STL models derived from MDCT DECT and CBCT respectively The male skull presented comparable accuracies to those observed on the female skull The and STL models acquired using the default threshold value demonstrated the highest loss of bone HU values c The NewTom STL model acquired using the default threshold value provided by Osirix MD software resulted in an increase in artefacts and noise The Vatech CBCT DICOM images did not allow the creation of an STL model using the default threshold value since the grey values were not scaled to HU values d Table

ICC Engineer Engineer Engineer Cadaver head Female male Female male Female male Female male Engineer Engineer Engineer Engineer Engineer Engineer Engineer Engineer Discussion To date thresholding is the most commonly used segmentation method in medical AM However accurate bone segmentation often requires manual threshold selection which still remains a subjective task Moreover recent studies suggest that the majority of inaccuracies that occur during the medical AM process are introduced during the image acquisition and image processing phases rather than during the manufacturing i e the printing process itself Such inaccuracies can markedly influence the resulting STL model Fig and subsequently lead to AM implants Therefore the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of manual and automatic default threshold selection on the reliability and accuracy of skull STL models Fig STL model of the female cadaver skull grey with disjointed structures red In the present study all threshold values selected by the four engineers demonstrated a good reliability Furthermore the reliability was also good as shown in Table Interestingly all engineers that were blinded during the experiment selected threshold values for bone that were very close to the grey values of soft tissues This resulted in small disjointed structures in the STL model red in Fig that represent the transition from bone into soft tissue grey values Such disjointed structures can be manually removed during STL All engineers purposely selected the threshold values during bone segmentation in order to incorporate the maximum number of grey values These grey values are allocated to voxels that represent different tissues during the CT image reconstruction process However during this process voxels on the tissue boundaries that are partially filled with soft tissue are commonly assigned a lower grey value than bone This phenomenon is coined the partial volume effect As a consequence of the PVE voxels may be erroneously allocated to instead of resulting in data loss and hence bone voids in the STL model Therefore engineers should be aware of this phenomenon since data loss can lead to large inaccuracies in individualized printed medical constructs Another major finding in this study was the difference between the MDCT and CBCT DICOM files that were used to construct STL models One explanation for this phenomenon is the inherent difference between these technologies CBCT technology is typically more heavily affected by image noise and distortions due to the geometry of the beam In CBCT the simultaneously irradiated area is typically larger than in MDCT technology This causes increased scatter levels and results in cupping reduced contrast and other artefacts in the reconstructed image In addition CBCT images are more subject to artefacts due to the large angle and the imaging geometry comprising a single focal plane The artefacts result from violating sufficiency condition that requires that each plane intersecting a region of interest must intersect the focal trajectory i e the path defining the radiation source position during the imaging The embodiments of artefacts are dependent on the reconstruction algorithm and the imaging geometry Typical artefacts include the elongation of structures in the axial direction and negative undershoots at sharp edges in the transaxial planes In CBCT the focal trajectory consists of a single planar circle or arc that results in a violation of sufficiency condition in all regions outside the focal plane The resulting artefacts are more pronounced the further away the region of interest is from the focal plane In MDCT the volume that satisfies sufficiency condition is notably larger due to the helical nature of the focal trajectory The presence of artefacts makes the segmentation and hence the thresholding of grey values in CBCT images more cumbersome This subsequently leads to a larger variation in manually selected threshold values for CBCT images and to the larger geometric variations of up to mm in STL models observed in this study STL models demonstrated geometric variations of up to mm As a consequence of these geometric variations in STL models the use of DECT and CBCT technology in its present form does not deliver reproducible STL models for medical AM Therefore the authors of this study suggest that only MDCT technology should be used for AM applications because of the lower variability mm see Fig and higher accuracy of the technology The present study demonstrates that the i e the medical engineer influences the outcome of the segmentation process Moreover no single bone threshold value is applicable for all facial bones The authors of this study therefore recommend the use of individual threshold values for each anatomical buttress Recently attempts have been made to develop novel segmentation algorithms using adaptive thresholding and region growing However these algorithms are still in an early stage of development and do not take the inherent differences between MDCT and CBCT technologies into account Future research should therefore focus on developing novel medical image segmentation software that is suitable for different CT imaging modalities Furthermore new approaches should be developed using pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms Conclusion This study shows that manual threshold selection results in better skull STL models than default thresholding since all the medical engineers in our study selected grey values closer to soft tissue to compensate for bone voids Our study also showed that STL models offer the lowest variability and highest accuracy whilst the use of DECT and CBCT technology in its present form does not deliver reliable STL models for medical AM New approaches based on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms are required Compliance with ethical standards Conflict of

provided you give appropriate credit to the original and the source provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made In recent debates on phenomenal consciousness a distinction is sometimes made after Levine and Kriegel between the of an experience i e the specific way it feels to the subject g blueish or sweetish or and its i e the fact that there is anything at all that it feels like to her I argue that much discussion of subjective character is affected by a conflation between three different notions I start by disentangling the three notions in question under the labels of and Next I argue that these notions are not in particular there is no conceptual implication from to or mineness Empirical considerations based on clinical cases additionally suggest that the three notions may also correspond to different properties the claim of conceptual does not depend on this further The aim is clarificatory cautionary but also critical I examine four existing arguments from subjective character that are fuelled by an undifferentiated use of the three notions and find them to be flawed for this reason http dx doi org http dx doi org Consejo Superior de Investigaciones http dx doi org Seventh Framework Programme Guillot Marie Springer Media Dordrecht Introduction The Subjective Character of Experience Experiences have intentional properties they represent the world as being a certain way Unlike other types of representations they also have phenomenal properties there is as Nagel famously puts it it is to have an experience for the subject undergoing it Take the sentence has a sweet and a sensory experience of the sweet smell of honeysuckle There is an aspect of reality that both representations are about yet they differ in that the existence of the sentence in itself affect anyone in any particular way while the existence of the experience affects me the subject in which it occurs by colouring my state of consciousness in a distinctive way making it a flowery fragrant pleasant state to be in In recent debates on consciousness a further distinction is sometimes made following Levine and Kriegel between two dimensions of phenomenality itself Levine calls them and Kriegel uses the terms and a pair I will prefer for its uniformity Here is how Levine introduces the two notions take my current visual experience as I gaze upon my red diskette case lying by my side on the computer table I am having an experience with a complex qualitative character one component of which is the color I perceive dub this aspect of my experience its character There are two important dimensions to my having this reddish experience First as mentioned above there is something like for me to have this experience an experience its being reddish is me a way like for me in a way that being red is like nothing fact is not in any way diskette case call this the subjectivity of conscious experience The second important dimension of experience that requires explanation is qualitative character itself Subjectivity is the phenomenon of there being something like for me to see the red diskette case Qualitative character concerns the like for me reddish or greenish painful or pleasurable and the like To notice the difference between these two dimensions is not to say that they are separable in what is intended rather is a conceptual distinction between simultaneously present and interdependent facets of phenomenal consciousness Within the complete phenomenal character of an experience what it is like for me to have the experience we can place the emphasis and fix our attention on two different aspects the qualitative character what it is like for me to have it and the subjective character what it is like for me to have it In treatment this comes out as a difference in levels of generality or in how we make our apprehension of phenomenality At the most end of the spectrum I can focus on the exquisitely particular way it is like for me when I smell the fur of a wet dog have pins and needles or feel a pang of nostalgia But I can also shift to the opposite end of the spectrum noticing the general feature across all of the above experiences that there is something or other that it feels like to me Whenever I am in a phenomenally conscious state there is a subjective character to the but depending on what particular experience it is the subjective character will be specified as this or that qualitative character As Kriegel puts it subjective character captures what remains constant across experiences while qualitative character captures what changes On the scheme I have adopted and so on are all phenomenal characters that are determinates of the determinable plain for One can focus the mind purely on subjective character by considering that which remains invariant among all the different determinates and on qualitative character by considering that which varies among them Kriegel thus casts the difference between subjective character and qualitative character as a difference between a determinable and its determinates Subjective Character by Other Names In the literature on phenomenal consciousness a wide range of alternative terms are used to talk about subjective character We have already encountered in the quotes of the previous section subjectivity and others talk of myness and Parnas Young or mineness Frith of a character or givenness of experience and Parnas of or Goldman or of the sense of self Strawson Damasio or sense of ownership Gallagher Block attaching to and the list goes on These terms tend to be treated as synonymous Here is for instance Kriegel Assuming that notion of is more or less the same as my notion of subjective character or emphasis And here is the kind of passage from Block that might be taken to support assumption of synonymy We may suppose that it is platitudinous that when one has a phenomenally conscious experience one is in some way aware of having it Sometimes people say Awareness is a matter of having a state whose content is in some sense to the self or having a state that is for me or that comes with a sense of ownership or that has my emphasis In the same spirit Zahavi and Kriegel write the point is that each of these objects when experienced is given to one in a distinctly way To deny that such a feature is present in our experiential life to deny the or mineness of experience is to fail to recognize the very subjectivity of experience emphasis The following characteristic passage from Gallagher and Zahavi uses no less than seven different expressions treated as broadly equivalent to capture the subjective character of experience The notion of is related to the idea that experiences have a subjective to them a certain quality of it is or what it like to have them I live through these differences various there is something experiential that is in some sense the same namely their distinct character All the experiences are characterized by a quality of mineness or the fact that it is I who am having these experiences All of this suggests that consciousness consequently entails a form of In short unless a mental process is there will be nothing it is like to undergo the process and it therefore cannot be a phenomenally conscious process bold italics However this terminological luxuriance I will argue does not help to delineate the notion at stake precisely On the contrary it betrays a certain conceptual blurriness in the discussion Despite the widespread assumption of a conceptual convergence the same terms are being used by different authors sometimes by the same author in different to stand for very different interpretations of the notion of subjective character Furthermore this ambiguity amounts to a confusion which is damaging to a number of current argumentative strategies Goals My goal in what follows is threefold clarificatory cautionary and critical Section and are devoted to the clarificatory and cautionary parts I start by showing in Section that and the family of terms widely treated as its synonyms are used to cover at least three different notions corresponding to three different ways to think of how the subject features in experience For convenience reserve for each of the three notions one of the expressions currently used indifferently and In Section I go on to show that the three notions do not form an equivalence class they do not stand in relations of mutual a priori entailment In particular entails neither nor mineness Section is devoted to an discussion of pathological cases which might be taken to indicate that the corresponding properties do not always occur together This would suggest that different properties and not just distinct concepts are being conflated in the debate If this is correct then my ternary conceptual distinction may open the way for a more accurate description of some pathological forms of experience than frameworks allow This descriptive gain would provide further support for the threefold distinction Section turns to the critical part The conflation is problematic not just in principle but because it makes a difference to existing arguments in the literature I review four such arguments and argue that they should be rejected Three Notions Subjective Character and the Subject From to and Mineness As this section aims to show actual uses of the expressions listed above etc reflect an uncertainty as to what exactly remains constant across experiences One thing seems uncontroversial The array of terms listed in Section points repeatedly to the subject and so on The suggestion is that the subjective character of experience essentially involves the subject of experience This presumably has to do with the fact that subjective character as the generic form of phenomenal character is what characterizes experiences as such contrast with other types of and that the existence of experiences in the world is inseparable from the existence of subjects in it The defining feature of subjects it is often assumed is that they are not simply present in the the world is presented to them Subjects are parts of the world just like mountains hurricanes and chairs but the world also appears to them or is to them as it does not appear is not to mountains or chairs But to appeared for the subject just is to have experiences and for those experiences to have a subjective character The point is often put by saying that a experiences constitute her of on the world and that having such a point of view is what it is to be a subject In short subjects experiences and subjective character can only be defined in terms of one another However this tell us what exact form the involvement of the subject should take in the definition of subjective character Clearly is not merely a label for the metaphysical fact that experiences are had by subjects in the sense that they occur in them It is intended to capture a further epistemic fact namely that subjects are aware of their and more demandingly still a phenomenological fact namely that this awareness is experiential and registers as a certain it to the subject This phenomenological thesis however still leaves open a number of ways in which the subject could feature in a description of subjective character Under the pen of different writers the subject appears variously as one of the two relata in the relation of phenomenal awareness to her experiences i e as the one who is appeared to as also appearing to herself in being aware of the other relatum as appearing to herself as the owner of the experience I briefly present the three options below To fix ideas reserve the expression to label the first way in which subjective character is commonly talked about On this first construal the object of awareness is the experience itself A Special Awareness of Experiences The notion can be introduced by observing that an experience has a manner of being unlike that of other types of things This is partly because there is someone a subject to whom the experience is present in a special way for whom there is something it is like for that experience to exist at all And no one else is affected in the same way by the existence of that particular experience The experience is in this sense given to it is for that someone to the exclusion of anyone else Which amounts to saying that there is someone for whom the experience by virtue of its mere existence and so long as it exists is an object of a special sort of awareness a mental state has subjective character just in case it is for the subject in the sense that the subject has a certain awareness of it my If I am feeling hungry or elated you too can be aware of my hunger or elation but not merely by virtue of the existence Moreover my own awareness of my experience is a way the experience affects it is a phenomenal kind of awareness Not so with your awareness of my experience You grasp it the you can of course have a distinct experience of the same The familiar observations above suggest that on this first interpretation subjective character is simply another name for phenomenal consciousness considered generically and under the most neutral description As Kriegel puts it conscious qualitative character makes it the conscious experience it is g a blueish or sweetish while its subjective character makes it a conscious experience at all The View In this first reading of subjective character what is at issue is the subject special awareness of her experience However according to several authors the most plausible way in which this could obtain is through that experience awareness of itself Whenever we are aware of something wet dog a song a this is because a mental state of ours has that thing as its object So the reasoning goes in the case where what we are aware of is our mental state itself the same must be true and the mental state must have itself as its object The fact that a mental state is would thus be understood in terms of the state having an turned towards itself in addition to constituting the awareness of something else i e that which the experience is an experience of dog the song the fragrance etc Let us call the view the view that subjective character construed as the property which experiences have of being is constituted by an awareness those experiences have of themselves This thesis has different variants The relevant kind of awareness is variously considered as a form of representation as a form of acquaintance or as a more elusive sui generis intrinsic glow that makes the state aware of itself without the need for it to dissociate itself in an structure Zahavi Drummond These differences however are immaterial to what follows I will remain entirely neutral as to whether the view in general or in any of its variants is true I introduce the view here because it will play a role in the discussion in Section What will matter then is the general claim that a state is in so far as it is aware of itself To summarise this subjective character construed as is the special awareness a subject and she alone has of her own experience just by virtue of having it theorists believe this is the result of the experience being aware of itself However this might be though what matters is that on the interpretation of subjective character the of the relation of awareness is taken up by the experience The subject for her part features only on the side of the relation of givenness that gives her access to her experience Her place is reversed in the second construal where she features as the object of awareness A second construal of subjective character places the focus of awareness on the subject herself rather than her experience According to a widespread view what makes an experience special for its subject is the fact that in living through it the subject is somehow aware of herself Enjoying phenomenal consciousness is a way to be phenomenally self reserve the expression as a label for this second interpretation The more general idea that consciousness involves on the part of the subject has a long history Descartes whose term for a conscious mental state is argues in the Second Meditation that any thought necessarily entails a knowledge of myself What is more as he insists in the discussion of the Seventh Objections to his Meditations this resides in the original conscious state initial thought by means of which we become aware of something does not differ from the second thought by means of which we become aware that we were aware of it any more than this second thought differs from the third thought by means of which we become aware that we were aware that we were aware vol VII p Thus it is at least arguable that for Descartes is a constitutive aspect of consciousness This also may have been the view of Locke according to whom it is for anyone to perceive without perceiving that he does Essay my The idea of a constitutive link between consciousness and lives on in the works of Kant Fichte and Husserl It is worth noting that neither Kant nor Fichte primarily envisaged a specifically phenomenal form of The chief form of of interest to Kant what he calls resides in a formal feature form of the that structures all experience without being an object of experience Fichte for his part talks of an of the Husserl on the other hand is a closer forebear to the contemporary notion of subjective character interpreted as For Husserl the is directly given in experience exist for myself and am constantly given to myself by experiential evidence as myself is true moreover with respect to any sense of the word ego Sec This prefigures the claim frequently found in the contemporary literature on subjective character that when phenomenally conscious of anything the subject is also phenomenally conscious of herself In words phenomenal consciousness must be interpreted precisely as entailing a minimal or thin form of if a certain organism is in possession of phenomenal consciousness then it must also be in possession of both a primitive form of and a core self Ibid Similar claims are found in Frankfurt Flanagan Block Chalmers Siewert Burge among many others The need for a distinction between and a second dimension of subjective character has been noted before Neisser for instance distinguishes from arguing that is not best understood as inner Drummond and Sebastian make related distinctions The binary distinction made in these works is a valuable one However it often consists in separating something like from a more dimension of subjective character which I believe still stands in need of further analysis As I argue below a finer ternary distinction is required to pinpoint the confusion pervading the current debate and to make an accurate description of a range of clinical cases Mineness A third common way of glossing subjective character presents it as a phenomenal awareness that my experiences are mine reserve the term for this third interpretation Everyone agrees that subjective character has to do with the fact that the existence of an experience resonates in a particular way with the subject in whom it occurs While on the first prominent way of discussing subjective character it corresponds to the fact that the subject is aware of her experience a special on the third interpretation it corresponds to the awareness of that very fact As part of the experience being given to a subject this subject is somehow aware of the experience being her own i e of its being an object for her of that special sort of awareness we sometimes call or to use the proprietary term This interpretation of subjective character is more complex than the other two considered so far It involves in the subject of experience an awareness of the experience with an awareness of herself with and an awareness of the relation ownership or between the two The belief that the way an experience is or to the subject marks phenomenally the experience as hers goes back at least to William James do not fly about loose but seem each to belong to someone thinker and not to another Each thought out of a multitude of other thoughts of which it may think is able to distinguish those which belong to its own Ego from those which do not Chap sq My emphasis In the recent debate a similar idea is endorsed by Zahavi One commonality different is the quality of mineness the fact that experiences are characterized by givenness That is the experience is given least as my experience as an experience I am undergoing or living through My emphasis Block argues that animals lacking a concept of self like dogs still have a because their experiences are phenomenally presented as theirs Even if monkeys and dogs have no however no one should deny that they have conscious pains conscious states often seem to have a about them the phenomenal state often represents the state as a state of me My emphasis To sum up construed as subjective character is a characteristic awareness of her experience read as it is her awareness of herself gained as part of having the understood as it is her awareness of herself as having the experience That the Three Concepts are not Equivalent There is a clear prima facie distinction between the three notions it is intuitively different to talk of an awareness of an experience of an awareness of the experiencer or of an awareness of the experiencer as owner of the experience Formal Differences Notice moreover the contrast in the form of the three predicates The common talk of as a or our experiences have or come with suggests a monadic predicate of the form x x ranges over Understood as however subjective character would seem instead to assume the form of a relation a relation R of awareness between a subject s and an experience x of hers of the form R s x Understood as subjective character appears to correspond to a relation R of a different form R s s namely a reflexive relation of awareness a subject s has to herself having an Lastly understood as mineness subjective character should correspond to a different relation again R Here we should expect a relation of higher complexity than the previous two since it is a relation of awareness between subject s and a fact i e the fact that she owns the experience she is contemplating This might be spelled out as R s s x i e as a relation R of awareness between a subject and the fact of ownership fact that experience x is Clearly R R and R have very different structures and this in itself should make us wary of collapsing the three notions into one What I want to argue now is that in addition the three notions are not conceptually equivalent since they do not stand in relations of mutual implication Mineness and its Implications It might seem that mineness at least should entail both and in virtue of its more complex structure As noted above to become phenomenally aware of myself as the owner of a given experience I need the more basic awareness of myself and of the experience This could be however a slightly misleading way to speak and much depends on what we mean here by i e whether or not we give it the narrower sense of a phenomenally conscious awareness Take a different kind of complex phenomenal state like the visual impression of a piano To achieve the awareness of the piano I certainly need more basic information about lines information about surfaces and information corresponding to the projection of the volume on the flat surface of the retina But does this entail that in being phenomenally aware of the piano as having depth and volume I am also phenomenally aware of it as a let alone a object That the and information is necessary to construct the phenomenally conscious visual awareness of the piano occupying space mean that this information itself is presented in a phenomenal format as the final output is And it is indeed quite unclear whether one can shift the focus of attention within the total visual impression of the piano between say a a and a appearance as one can shift attention between the whitish and the blackish components in impression of the keyboard That we can do the first kind of shift is doubtful even though we can perfectly well in other contexts have a phenomenal awareness of a piano g by looking at a drawing of the The complexity of a phenomenal datum does not always entail the phenomenal accessibility of each of its components Thus even if some form or other of awareness of the experience and of myself is a necessary condition for the phenomenal awareness of myself as owner of the experience it follow that an a priori relation of implication holds from mineness to phenomenal awareness of the and phenomenal awareness of the and its Implications It is much more doubtful still in any case that any other relations of entailment unite the three notions Let us consider I described it above as the putative phenomenal awareness of myself that I gain in having an experience Does this not involve at the very least an awareness of the experience itself i e A certain kind of transparency argument might make room for questioning this transition Some writers suggest that when I am asked what it is like exactly for me smell a wet dog to hear the song of the I must attend in answering to the same outward objects and properties as I would attend to if I were asked a question about dogs or birds This would suggest that what is to or in an experience is not the experience itself but the worldly objects and properties that it represents Thus Martin on staring at a lavender bush When my attention is directed out at the world the lavender bush and its features occupy centre stage It is also notable that when my attention is turned inwards instead to my experience the bush is not instead replaced by some other entity belonging to the inner realm of the mind I attend to what it is like for me to inspect the lavender bush through perceptually attending to the bush itself while at the same time reflecting on what I am doing So it does not seem to me as if there is any object apart from the bush for me to be attending to or reflecting on while doing this Such a view considered here merely for the sake of argument be compatible with a conception of subjective character as in which the latter does not entail any direct phenomenal awareness of the experience itself Take my total experience as I play the piano I am aware of the piano in front of me and of the unfolding and even though this is not the focus of the experience I am also continually aware of myself fingers on the keys my feet on the pedals my breathing the contraction of my The transparentist could accept that I am thus presented with myself throughout that there is in this sense a to the she could even entertain the possibility that this might be the case whenever I but she would at the same time deny that there is also a way in which I am presented with the experience itself This is not conceptually incoherent Accordingly it is at least open to question whether the notion of construed as the phenomenal awareness of myself that I gain through an entails the notion of It is even more doubtful whether entails mineness This would require a phenomenal awareness both of myself and of my experience and we have just seen that the latter part might not be secured a priori by the notion of But it would also require something further namely a phenomenal awareness of the relation of ownership between my experience and myself Even granting that experience provides phenomenal access to both the subject and the experience itself there is no a priori reason why it should also provide phenomenal access to the fact that the latter stands in a special relation to the former In fact in some extreme situations like the pathological phenomenon of in shizophrenics there might be reason to think that phenomenal awareness of just such a relation is missing more about this in Section If it is at least open to question whether either or mineness entail any of the other two notions as hypotheses under which the entailments hold are not obviously then there is in any case no straightforward implication to rely on The transition from or mineness to the other notions should thus not be made without argument as it so often is and its Implications More decisive than those doubts concerning the implications of mineness and however is the lack of any reason to think that the notion of should entail either or mineness that is very substantial theoretical more on this in Section is a certain kind of awareness relation connecting the subject to her experience and perhaps more primitively the experience to itself the thesis is What matters is that in either case only the relatum that the subject of the awareness figures as the object of awareness The notion of an awareness of an experience will not as such yield the notion of an awareness of the self The experience and the self are distinct particulars And it is not generally the case that when we say that something is is given to me we mean that I am aware of that thing and also of myself Take the conscious perception of a table When we say that this is a way that the table is given to me we mean to talk about an awareness that has the table as its object Without further assumptions being built into the notion of i e without going beyond the terms in which it is usually introduced as an awareness of a certain kind of our experiences we accept that what goes for tables go for experiences When a situation is described as one in which things are what is asserted is that aware of those things not eo ipso of I am in an awareness relation to those but this is not the same as being aware of the relation itself or of the fact that it obtains This relation of awareness as such make me aware of both relata but only of the relatum that me In the construal of subjective character then the self to borrow an evocative expression often used by Zahavi and Drummond is a mere of the experience Only in the and perhaps in the readings is it involved in the position as an object of phenomenal awareness To move from the dative to the accusative is to shift to a different notion Kenneth Williford makes the point eloquently If we accept that there is a dative of manifestation that objects and qualities appear to someone or something we are closer to but not quite up to subjective character just yet Subjective character recall is supposed to be something phenomenologically detectable And one might raise the following sort of worry Suppose phenomenally manifest objects and properties are manifest to something or someone It does not follow from this alone that that to which they are manifest is itself manifest or even manifestable Nor does it follow that the fact that they are manifest to something is manifest or even manifestable In other words there could indeed be a dative of manifestation and yet no direct phenomenological evidence of this at all Williford Now one might object to the foregoing by insisting that for something to be to or just for me to be enjoying just any kind of awareness of it a matter of being phenomenally conscious of that of it being presented to me manifest to me in short of my experiencing it And one might think that this kind of awareness relation unlike others does involve being aware of both relata To which I would reply that while this might well be true it is a substantive claim and something for which evidence should be produced rather than an immediate conceptual truth flowing from the notion of which one could take for granted The notion of that we started with the notion that is introduced through the familiar point that a subject is aware of her present experience in a way that others are not by itself yield any suggestion that part of what makes this of being special is that it encompasses all of the subject of awareness the object of her awareness and their relation within its reach Nor does it follow from the grammar of such expressions as something being to x or x that x should at the same time be given to herself I also doubt that such implications could be drawn from a mere conceptual analysis of the notion of defined as a state there is something it is like to be in for its subject Unless some theoretical preferences are added to the notion of then there is no justification for using it interchangeably with the notions of and mineness as is too often done without argument and its Implications on Views What kind of further theoretical commitments could conceivably license the transition from to and mineness Maximalism About Perhaps an example could be found in a possible variant of the view sketched above in Section According to the view the of an experience I am aware of it in a special is a result of its being more primitively aware of itself This is the view that Kriegel Williford and Zahavi defend under various specifications as we have seen One could conceivably interpret the claim common to all those variants that a state that is is a state that is aware of itself in a maximalist way as meaning that such a state is aware of all of its properties including the relational property of being an experience of this or that subject However this would not be a particularly attractive theory to phenomenal awareness is not in general an awareness of all the properties of its objects including their relational properties visual awareness of a chair does not include an awareness of its relational property of having been made by a particular carpenter or of being comfortable for me To my knowledge none of the advocates of the view endorses this extreme version In any case were one to defend such a maximalist version of the view this would constitute a substantive step beyond the mere use of the notion of and it would be very different from assuming a conceptual equivalence between the three notions of subjective character Minimalism About the Self Another example of a assumption under which might entail at least is to be found in the approach to the self A family of writers including Zahavi and Williford argue that the self or at least a form of selfhood or is identical either with experience or with some part or intrinsic property of experience Williford thus proposes that identify the subject with the episode or stream of consciousness Zahavi claims that the subject or self is identical with a feature of experience namely its the self is identified with the very givenness of the experiential phenomena most basic form of selfhood is the one constituted by the very of experience Thus the self referred to is not something standing beyond or opposed to the stream of experiences but is rather a feature or function of its givenness Now on such views it could be argued that does entail if the self is the experience a part or intrinsic feature then to be phenomenally aware of the experience is to be phenomenally aware of the self Indeed this is just the way Williford seeks to bridge the gap between and he so lucidly identifies in the passage quoted above However the entailment between and in this context does not flow from a conceptual equivalence between the two notions but from the additional support of a substantive extra premise Namely that the self is identical with or part the experience This is in no way included in the notions of and which merely stand for special relations of awareness between the subject and her experience and between the subject and herself respectively No further commitment about the metaphysics of subjects is built into those concepts And the minimalist thesis about the self is very far from trivial According to common sense and in ordinary linguistic practice I have experiences had a really bad experience with her last it can be the case that I had an experience an hour or a year ago now gone Venice was a wonderful This is incompatible with my being identical with the experience The minimalist view uncontroversial in the context of philosophical thinking either It competes at the very least with views according to which the self is a mental substance a substratum of experiences an animal with both physical and mental properties a spatial part of an animal typically a brain or part of a brain a causal system that can produce experiences and so on and so forth Thus while the minimalist view of the self is a framework in which arguably entails the entailment a matter of conceptual equivalence between those two notions but depends on substantive extra premises in need of independent argument This last point will have some importance for the critical discussion in Section below Again even on a minimalist approach the implication from to depends on the minimalist view of the self being independently proved true To be allowed to draw the implication we need a separate defence of the thin metaphysics of selfhood Instead of which minimalists typically assume that the implication from to holds because they often use an undifferentiated notion of subjective character to cover both aspects and then go on to rely on the alleged conceptual connection to defend a thin theory of the self This is getting it backwards and the move is unwarranted A Tentative Diagnosis for the Assumption of a Conceptual Equivalence and mineness then do not form an equivalence class of notions Whether mineness entails either or or whether entails either or mineness is at the very least open to question In any case it is clear that entails neither nor mineness which is enough to defeat the assumption of mutual equivalence The Connotations of A number of considerations might help explain why this should be sometimes overlooked One possible reason could be the ambiguity of the word which as a reflexive pronoun can stand for any reflexive relation but which as a noun stands for a certain kind of particular a subject can thus mean the awareness that some particular an has of itself or more specifically the awareness that a self has of herself But slips might occur between the two notions encouraging particularly under the assumption that is a matter of an unwarranted transition from to The passage from Gallagher and Zahavi already quoted above could well be an illustration of this or is more likely at least guilty of a form of expression that invites the confusion as it goes in the same breath from a understood as a access to myself to a mental state being All the experiences are characterized by a quality of mineness or the fact that it is I who am having these experiences All the experiences are given least as my experiences as experiences I am undergoing or living through All of this suggests that experience presents me with an immediate and access to myself and that consciousness consequently entails a form of In short unless a mental process is there will be nothing it is like to undergo the process and it therefore cannot be a phenomenally conscious process bold type The Connotations of Another likely influence is the frequent use in the debate of the notion of a access to or perspective upon or knowledge of our own experiences to capture their The qualifier just means that the subject has the exclusive enjoyment of this type of access perspective or not that she is their object By contrast a access perspective or kind of knowledge are ones that are equally available to all thinkers The asymmetry between and epistemic relations defined by what occupies the object side of the relation but by the constraints on those just me or anyone who can be on the recipient side And while the self is certainly a salient candidate for being a possible object of access not all access is directed to the occurrent experience constitutes another such object Still the ambiguity in the of the expression a perspective of the first person or on the first person encourages reading off the notion more than it contains An interesting passage from Kriegel could constitute an illustration of this Kriegel Section defends the claim that intransitive consciousness depends on intransitive e on a peripheral consciousness the subject has of In effect this amounts to the claim that there can be no type of awareness of experiences that makes them conscious at without The first of his two arguments says Kriegel can be summarized as follows conscious states are knowable mental states must be intransitively therefore conscious states are intransitively The decisive premise is the second one that knowable mental states must be states in which the self is intransitively e conscious of herself And this is just where the connotations of the qualifier might be playing a role Here is the argument Kriegel gives to establish the second premise Now it seems that the only experiences and thoughts we can have knowledge of are experiences and thoughts we have that is experiences and thoughts we are peripherally aware of having For when we have a mental state that is without any awareness of it whatsoever we have to infer its existence on the basis of evidence which means that our knowledge of it is mediated in a way knowledge is not My emphasis Here is why I think the argument is problematic The first sentence is a reformulation of the second premise one have knowledge of a state without being aware of having it In other words given a mental state of which I know if I have knowledge of it then I am aware of the fact that I am having it This is then defended in the second sentence via an appeal to the intuitiveness of its contraposition i e the proposition that given a mental state of which I know if I have this knowledge in a way that involves on my part then I have knowledge of it only But notice the gloss of the antecedent of this contraposition inserted between the dashes italicised by in the quote above not having knowledge of a mental state in a way that involves is suddenly equated to being any awareness of it This is clearly not an equivalence that can be taken for granted as it constitutes precisely what is at issue here i e whether I can be phenomenally aware of my mental state without also being aware of myself Once we accept the equivalence the argument goes through because a state of which I am not phenomenally aware is indeed a state I can only know about but we accept it because So why is the equivalence put forward I think it might inherit undue intuitive appeal from the connotations of two of the expressions used in the argument First knowing the experience in a way that involves being is rephrased in the first sentence of the passage as being aware of having it The surface grammar of the latter form of words might invite an equivocation The most natural and correct way to read the infinitive clause is with an implicit subject or argument i e as aware of my having which does express However because the subject is elided the turn of phrase surreptitiously makes available another weaker reading namely aware of the state being i e being aware of its occurring That a state I am not aware is being had is is not a state I am aware of is trivially but that a state I am not aware of in a way that involves is a state I am not aware is being had at all is on the other hand a substantive claim precisely the claim that the argument seeks to establish and precisely the claim too that the problematic equivalence between the dashes smuggles in possibly under the influence of the ambiguity in the expression aware of having Second as pointed out above the expression while really standing for the kind of knowledge only the subject is in a position to gain has the potential to mislead suggesting simultaneously that the subject is what the knowledge is of Under this unwarranted suggestion the claim that a subject who as part of having an experience is unable to know the experience gains an unearned appearance of intuitiveness Different Concepts or Different Properties The upshot of the previous section is that there is no mutual equivalence between the three notions really being conflated in debates on subjective character At best mineness might entail both and but not as straightforwardly as it might initially seem and are likely to be mutually independent and neither depends on mineness certainly entails neither nor mineness This is reason enough to avoid using the three concepts interchangeably But could it be that they also apply to distinct properties One way to show this would be to find phenomena in the actual world to which not all three notions are applicable Some empirical cases might tentatively be taken to suggest that and mineness can fail to occur simultaneously in some pathological conditions In particular or mineness may sometimes fail to be instantiated even though is instantiated If and mineness can indeed selectively disappear giving rise to distinct pathologies then my threefold distinction might prove a useful tool for describing empirical data more accurately Without and Mineness In this I rely heavily on recent work by Alexandre Billon forthcoming elaborating on it slightly The first type of empirical case of potential relevance is the depersonalisation syndrome and Abugel Sierra as well as its extreme delusional form first described by Cotard Patients who experience depersonalisation typically as a part of severe depression report an alteration of their experiences In many cases it no longer seems as though the experiences are theirs And often it no longer seems as though they exist at all Here are two typical reports of the first kind of distortion some depersonalised patients appear to be phenomenally aware of their experiences but not of the fact that the experiences are theirs It was as if it was not me walking it was not me talking as if it was not me living I can look at me I am somehow bothered by my body as if it me as if I lived on the side of my body on the side of myself if you like I know how to explain and Raymond When a part of my body hurts I feel so detached from the pain that it feels as if it were somebody pain and Berrios Here are also reports of of as Billon calls them Billon interprets those as experiences in which the depersonalised patient lacks a phenomenal awareness of herself I imagine myself seeing life as if it were played like a film in a cinema But in that case where am I Who is watching the film and Abugel It almost feels like I have died but no one has thought to tell me So left living in a shell that I recognize any more In a recent series of articles Billon makes a powerful case for the claim that the experiences of depersonalised and Cotard patients is evidence of the possibility of phenomenal awareness without subjective character But this claim might strike some as insofar as subjective character is supposed to be what makes something an experience at all While I find the general direction of argument very compelling I think that the distinction I propose in lieu of the misleadingly monolithic notion of subjective character might allow for a more conservative and perhaps more intuitive description of the pathology For consider the first type of report above suggests that the patients lack a phenomenal awareness that the experiences they report are theirs feel so detached from the pain that it feels as if it were somebody In my terminology they lack The second type of report suggests that those patients additionally lack a phenomenal awareness of the presence of their own selves almost feels like I have am I As Simeon and Abugel put it in depersonalisation no clear feeling of literally no more experience of a at all In my terminology the depersonalised patients lack On the other hand something of the subjective character of the abnormal experiences does seem to be retained Those experiences are the subjects undergoing them given to them in a special way that enables them to report on a phenomenal occurrence pain an impression as of a walking movement etc in the direct manner that no one else could report it In my terminology those experiences have I thus propose to describe the depersonalisation syndrome as a condition in which experience lacks both mineness and but retains A word on the motivation for locating the manifestation of the disorder at the phenomenal level As Billon stresses while Cotard patients are delusional actively denying ownership of their experiences and sometimes claiming to be dead depersonalised patients refrain from taking the abnormal experiences at They actually believe that they own the experiences or that they exist as evidenced by the careful wording of their reports was as feels as almost feels imagine myself etc As Billon convincingly argues this makes it plausible that the problem comes specifically from the disturbing lack of an impression of an experience that used to be present rather than say from the lack of a belief the self exists or that the problematic experiences are and Without Mineness The second type of case of potential interest is the phenomenon of or or thoughts in some schizophrenic patients Frith Gallagher Bortolotti Inserted thoughts are thoughts that the subject reports as occurring in her stream of consciousness but which nonetheless she refuses to acknowledge as her own typically claiming that someone else produced those thoughts and put them in her mind Here are some characteristic reports said that sometimes it seemed to be her own thought I get the feeling that it She said her thoughts might say the same the feeling the feeling is that it is somebody I look out of the window and I think the garden looks nice and the grass looks cool but the thoughts of Eamonn Andrews come into my mind There are no other thoughts there only He treats my mind like a screen and flashes his thoughts on to it like you flash a picture One evening one thought was given to me electrically that I should murder Lissi It is a question how thought insertion is best described and understood What I will call the interprets it as a case where a subject lacks a of over her thoughts What is now the standard account treats it rather as a case where she does have a of but no of over her thoughts i e where she lacks the sense of having actively produced them and Graham Gallagher A third account construes alien thoughts as cases where the subject fails to endorse the content of her thoughts or commit to them A reason which is often given to reject the which construes inserted thoughts as mental states unaccompanied by a feeling of ownership is that the patient retains access to her inserted thoughts just as to all of her other normal thoughts The thoughts do occur in her stream of consciousness as she deny This case for rejecting the I suspect rests in part on a failure to distinguish between different notions of subjective character As I pointed out at the start the concept of a of is generally used in a fashion that discriminate between a special way we are aware of our experiences i e in a way others be aware of a way we are aware of ourselves in having and a way we are aware of owning those experiences Once those three sense of are disentangled more conceptual resources become available to describe the predicament of a patient with alien thoughts In particular it becomes possible to acknowledge that the abnormal thoughts are given to her in a way exhibiting while still hypothesising that she might be specifically lacking a sense of owning those thoughts mineness Note that schizophrenics with thought insertion nonetheless seem to retain a phenomenal awareness of themselves while having the problematic thoughts as shown by the normal use of terms in their reports In what amounts to a more sophisticated version of the made available by my threefold distinction I thus propose to describe thought insertion as a condition in which experience lacks mineness but retains both and The Descriptive Benefit of the Tripartite Framework My distinction has the additional merit of providing us with a principled way to distinguish between the two types of pathologies discussed in the last two i e the depersonalisation spectrum and the phenomenon of inserted thoughts It is now customary to describe delusions as broadly rational responses to abnormal experiences and Coltheart Which abnormal experience helps us classify the delusions In particular the delusion and the depersonalisation syndrome in its delusional form can both be viewed as rational responses to unusual experiences whose abnormality specifically has to do with an impaired subjective character But saying only this much leaves us without a way to mark the difference between the two conditions Further distinguishing under the blanket expression the three notions I separate here permits to characterise the two pathologies in distinct ways I proposed that the experience of prototypical Cotard patients exhibits but neither nor mineness I also suggested that schizophrenic inserted thoughts might exhibit and but not mineness Why think that is lacking in the first type of case but not the second First we should by default accept at the reports of patients and we have seen that of are a specific complaint of Cotard sufferers Here is a characteristic report by a patient am not Myself at all What is missing is myself it is awful to elude oneself to live and not to be oneself Schizophrenics with do not make such reports of Second as Billon Sec shows in detail many Cotard patients are uncomfortable using the word sometimes preferring or or proper names or nicknames or complicated periphrases This might be taken as a further indication that the underlying of a and Abugel is lacking Again this is not matched by the linguistic behaviour of patients with Both the depersonalisation spectrum and leave intact while affecting subjective character in some other way Accepting my tripartite distinction allows us to say what way that might be in each case The level of detail required to keep separate what are thought to be different nosographic kinds is thus a further motivation for adopting a threefold approach Of course the psychiatric conditions described in this section are complex and difficult to understand and a proper defence of the characterisation of depersonalisation and I propose here would require a much more detailed study The main point of this discussion however so much to argue that the phenomena under consideration are indeed best interpreted as I suggest It is rather to show that such an interpretation is consistent and that we can thus conceive of possible cases where and mineness fail to be instantiated together whether or not the real pathologies mentioned above turn out to be just such cases The three concepts accordingly correspond to different properties properties which could fail to be all satisfied by the same particular In addition there is at least some initial appeal to the suggestion that they also fail to be jointly satisfied in some pathological cases in reality and Mineness in Normal Experience None of this it should be emphasised rules out that all the ordinary experiences of normal subjects exhibit conjointly and mineness In fact I think there is reason to believe this to be the case Here is an argument from justification In ordinary circumstances when I have an experience say a tactile experience of the silky fur this as such gives me some justification for making a number of judgments These include at least the judgment that the cat has silky the judgment that an experience to this effect is the judgment that I am the judgment that the experience is mine It has been argued that experiences furthermore give immediate justification for judgments such as Here I use the notion of as defined by Soldati To say that the perceptual experience provides the subject with immediate justification to judge is to say that it gives her kind of warrant that does not depend on for instance any further inferentially acquired justification The experience as of the fur being silky can be used as evidence that the fur is silky having to rely on any further to support the experience itself The experience is a reason to judge the fur to be silky that is not itself in need of further justification Note that this notion of immediate justification concerns the type of the epistemic warrant not the strength of this warrant or the psychological capacities involved in arriving at it Justification that is immediate in this sense does not have to be in the case of perceptual experience it is in fact typically defeasible And to say that the experience warrants the corresponding judgment immediately is not to say that the judgment is arrived at in a way that is psychologically it does not in particular rule out that conceptual capacities are involved in the process as they surely are or that we need to have other beliefs in other to acquire the relevant concepts The immediacy I have in mind characterises the justification relation between two states experience and the not their psychological relation Now I think that at least as good a case can be made that experience also immediately justifies judgments and Suppose I am now undergoing some experience or other e g feeling the smooth fur The mere presence of this experience as such is evidence for judging that the experience is present that I am present and that the experience is mine Having an experience is enough to be licensed to judge it is happening to it and to judge that I exist When I reflect on the experience and make those judgments if asked for my reason to do so it is hard to see what else I could invoke than the experience itself Again this does not mean that my capacity to make the judgments is only that the relevant epistemic warrant is provided by the mere having of the experience It is something about the experience something intrinsic to it that supports judgments and This I take to be at least a prima facie reason to think that we typically have experiential access to the experience to ourselves and to the fact that the experience is or in my terminology that the phenomenal character of a normal experience includes and mineness Further support for this claim is offered by a contrast with blindsight patients These patients have large blind areas in their visual fields but are somehow able to respond correctly to visual stimuli located in those areas No visual phenomenology however accompanies those responses Whether or not it is appropriate to say that blindsight patients have visual experiences in those instances it seems doubtful that they would in any case be immediately justified in judging experiences to be present or in those experiences Their justification would have to proceed through a more circuitous route Let us imagine a patient trained to regularly form beliefs about the objects in her blind field She could notice that she has the belief that a certain object is in her blind use her background understanding of her condition and her knowledge that when she has this sort of belief it is usually because a form of visual perception she is unaware of is taking and infer on this basis that she must be the object in question This be an immediate justification directly based on the mere having of the experience itself and nothing else as is the case in normal subjects But note that the only difference between the and a normal subject is that the latter enjoys visual phenomenology while the former does not So when a subject has a visual perception whatever in the experience gives her immediate justification to judge that an experience is occurring that she herself is present and that the experience is hers must be exclusively based on the phenomenal character of the experience This I take to be a good reason to think that normal experience displays and mineness Taking Stock What precedes makes it reasonable I believe to hold the following is plausibly present wherever there is phenomenal consciousness It is extremely hard to imagine a case where this be and it might be a conceptual truth our main handle on the notion of phenomenal awareness consisting in spelling it out in terms of being something it is like for me to have an experience On the other hand mineness the case of inserted and even the case of depersonalised and Cotard might disappear from phenomenal consciousness in some pathological contexts At the very least it is conceivable that they could disappear as attested by the fact that the proposed interpretation of the pathological cases is coherent This supports the thesis that different properties correspond to the three notions Nonetheless all three properties are likely present in normal experiences Now the fact that the terms standing for subjective character are used in a way that betrays a lack of discrimination between the three different notions is certainly due to the fact that writers take all three concepts to describe adequately phenomenal awareness as they encounter it i e in ordinary cases And so it probably is as I have just argued But that would be a substantial result and not a conceptual truth Every time a move is made from to or mineness an argument must be produced But such an argument will very often be found to be lacking and an equivalence to be presupposed wrongly as I hope to have and to damaging effect for existing arguments as I will argue in what remains of this essay A Confusion Affecting Argumentative Practice Kriegel and Zahavi The aim of my observations is not merely a cautionary one i e to urge for terminological regimentation lest we fell into equivocations that would invalidate our reasoning on subjective character It is also the confusion as I submit in this final section already has damaging effects on existing arguments Three of the four arguments I review are taken from works by Kriegel or Zahavi This to suggest that the conflation I hope to have identified is specific to them The examples below are representative of a much more widespread tendency in the literature I concentrate on those two writers because they with a few others have greatly contributed to advancing our understanding of subjective character in recent years Rather than singling them out for criticism the focus reflects the importance of their work on the issue A first example of an argument undermined by the conceptual shift was already analysed in Section An argument offered by Kriegel in support of the claim that a state being conscious at all depends on peripheral on the part of the subject was found to be assuming as it does the equivalence between and mineness A second illustration was offered in Section in the discussion of schizophrenic According to the of the phenomenon this is a case where experiences come without a of A widely accepted argument against this interpretation invokes the observation that a patient with alien thoughts still has to them I suggested that the argument trades on an unwarranted equation between and mineness and has accordingly little weight A third example is to be found in Zahavi and Kriegel The article introduces subjective character in terms befitting your experiences of perceiving an apple and remembering a banana the two experiences have something very fundamental in common in both cases it is for you that it is like something to have them They go on however to use this notion indiscriminately with what is really talking of a point of involved on the part of the subject by virtue of the fact that her experiences are given to her a distinctly This shift proves damaging for at least one of the arguments The authors consider in Section the ease with which we are able to report on our experiences You are presently absorbed in reading this if suddenly what experience are having can respond immediately and effortlessly In addition there is any sense of surprise regarding what the experience instead there is a sense of familiarity Zahavi and Kriegel propose that the best explanation for this ease of reportability and for the feeling of familiarity is that my awareness of the experience is part of the experience itself In other words the experience includes as part of its phenomenal character the best explanation of the sense of familiarity with and lack of surprise regarding my concurrent experience is that I was aware of it all along in that it is built into the very phenomenal character of the experience that it is like something for me and Kriegel The phenomenal datum that is grounds another phenomenal datum namely the feeling of familiarity with our experiences and also serves as the categorical basis of a disposition namely our capacity to report the experiences with ease So far so good However the authors go on to rephrase this very convincing point by saying that is a categorical basis for a distinct disposition namely our capacity for thought Our own explanation is that this sense of familiarity and lack of surprise is grounded in the ubiquitous of experience which itself is the categorical basis of capacity for thought in the right kind of creatures Ibid The standard meaning of identifies it as a thought about the subject entertaining it typically a of the form am The suggestion here is that grounds the capacity to form thoughts in which we our experiences e g I am consciously I am smelling the etc This is quite different from saying that grounds our capacity to report the mere presence of the experience While I find great intuitive appeal to the weaker initial claim a phenomenal awareness of our experiences grounds our capacity to think about I think that the more substantive one to which the authors transition without warning a phenomenal awareness of our experiences grounds our capacity to think about ourselves would require much additional support As I hope to have shown in Section nothing in the notion of as such allows us to treat it as an awareness the subject has of herself Even if we accept that is the categorical basis for our capacity to judge a certain experience to be present it follow without further argument that this very same property is also the categorical basis of our capacity to judge that we are present and own the experience Distinct phenomenal properties namely and mineness would seem more suited to ground these further dispositions It is likely that Zahavi and failure to distinguish between the three different notions and corresponding properties is what leads them to present a stronger claim as a mere reformulation of the weaker one they previously argue for A fourth and final example of the effects of the confusion is to be found in an argument from the presence of in phenomenal consciousness to the conclusion that there exists such a thing as a or or self within the stream of consciousness This line of thought is familiar from the works of Zahavi Chapter G Strawson Damasio Gallagher and others The inference is problematic whether it is taken to yield by order of increasing strength an epistemic thesis have an awareness of the self in having a phenomenal thesis access to the self is of the phenomenal or a metaphysical thesis is the self or at least a form of Zahavi commits to all three claims as the characteristic passage below makes clear the self is claimed to possess experiential reality is taken to be closely linked to the perspective and is in fact identified with the very givenness of the experiential phenomena most basic form of selfhood is the one constituted by the very of experience To be conscious of one self consequently is not to capture a pure self that exists in separation from the stream of consciousness but rather entails just being conscious of an experience in its mode of it is a question of having access to own experiential life Thus the self referred to is not something standing beyond or opposed to the stream of experiences but is rather a feature or function of its givenness In short the self is taken to be an integral part of our conscious life with an immediate experiential reality When undergoing an experience one is of epistemic thesis nothing more is needed for this awareness of oneself than conscious of an experience in its mode of phenomenal thesis furthermore self referred just is identified very givenness of the experiential metaphysical thesis Now as I argued in Section and the of that Zahavi invokes i e the fact that it manifests itself to me does not entail that I am thereby aware of myself in any way The uncontroversial observation that experiences are special to their subject in that they are an object of access to her cannot be equated with the much more contentious thesis that the experiencing subject is thereby cf Section transition from the subjective character of experience to an awareness of the self in experience is thus a great leap but one that he considers as relatively innocuous precisely because he fails to distinguish between subjective character as as and as mineness As the assumption of an equivalence is unwarranted the argument from the of experience to a phenomenal access to the self go through As to the metaphysical thesis that the quality of experience is the self it succumbs to the same objection as the phenomenal thesis in so far as it presupposes it Both theses might still be true gave an argument for the phenomenal thesis in arguing for the presence of in normal experience in Section but they cannot be established simply on the basis of our noticing that there is something it is like for us to experience Conclusion In this essay I argued that much of the debate on the subjective character of experience is affected by a failure to distinguish between three different dimensions one might identify as the invariant phenomenal core across all experiences that my experiences appear to me that I am manifested to myself through them and that they are presented as my own mineness I showed that the three corresponding notions do not form a class of mutually equivalent concepts at the very least entails neither nor mineness I also gave some reason to doubt whether the complementary relations of entailment hold The previous point in any case suffices to preclude conceptual equivalence between all three notions In addition I argued that the notions correspond to distinct properties which could fail to be instantiated simultaneously That this is at least conceivable is showed by presenting an interpretation of some mental pathologies where could be thought to occur without mineness and with neither mineness nor and Cotard Whether or not the interpretation is correct would mean that the three properties are not always jointly present in the actual it is at least coherent means that they are distinct That different notions as well as different properties are being conflated in discussions of subjective character invites greater caution in the future and I recommend the use of distinct terms to keep track of the three dimensions This essay also amounts to a critique of all arguments trading on the illegitimate assumption of an equivalence between and mineness I analyse in detail four examples of arguments guilty of this and found them accordingly invalid See also Zahavi and on subjective character Other contemporary authors making use of related notions include those cited in Section as well as Shoemaker G Strawson Gallagher Neisser Drummond Hohwy Ganeri sq Williford This representative list is far from exhaustive Kriegel my emphasis I ignore a complication here among those who think that the relevant awareness of a given mental state m is to be understood as the result of m being the object of a mental state there is a dispute as to whether is a distinct mental state or is identical to m theorists g Rosenthal defend the first option while theorists g Kriegel advocate the second option To simplify I talk here as if the approach were however nothing in what follows hangs on this What matters here is just that the target of the relevant awareness is the conscious experience m Forebears to the view include Sartre Brentano and perhaps Aristotle see Caston The expression is See his Chapter in which he gives a perceptive critical account of the view Cf e g Principles of Philosophy Part I in Descartes VIIIA p Doing justice to the richness and complexity of the historical roots of the notion of subjective character as would far exceed the limits of this paper and would constitute a distinct project The goal here is simply to highlight an existing use of the notion of subjective character and to argue that it is conceptually distinct from the other two common uses I identify in sections and See also Neisser for a similar distinction See also e g P F Strawson I am grateful to Lucy O Brien for pointing this out to me E g Dretske Tye Martin But see below More on Williford in below Dainton Sections and and Peacocke both make a detailed case that we can conceive a creature endowed with conscious states states that are the creature but with no phenomenal awareness of itself whatsoever no Kriegel for instance appears to restrict the scope of what is covered by the awareness of itself to its semantic properties I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for inviting me to discuss this issue The of the self advocated in G Strawson bears a resemblance to this type of minimalism but the close relation it describes between self and experience arguably falls short of identity Minimal notions of selfhood are also to be found in Damasio and Gallagher among others Williford quoted in above I am not sure whether it could additionally be argued on such views that entails mineness if only because it is doubtful whether we can still talk of the subject owning her experience if she is identical with it an aspect of As I stressed above this is not the case of Williford More on this in below My emphasis The second argument reprised from Rosenthal is that one think at all of a particular mental state opposed to the kind of mental state it is an instance without thinking of the subject of that state I see any reason to accept this Another way to think of a token mental state in an individuating manner is to think of its time and place of occurrence Yet another way is to think a singular or de re thought about it which we can do by being acquainted with it whether or not we associate any individuating descriptions with it Neisser especially Chapter offers an extended analysis and critique in the same spirit All the reports are quoted by Billon in this first quote the translation from the French is also his Billon argues that the depersonalisation syndrome is evidence for the possibility of phenomenal consciousness without I take him to use the term in a way that encompasses at least and mineness as defined here although he make those further distinctions His interpretation of the data he reviews might be compatible with my point here namely that the absence of subjective character in both those senses entail the absence of see Billon for qualifications Putting the claim in this way has the advantage of not equating it to the claim that phenomenal awareness can occur without subjective character in any sense of the term In my interpretation some kind of subjective character although not all of its three forms is retained in the experience of depersonalised and Cotard patients For a review of the debate see Bortolotti Chapter By contrast as Billon Section stresses some Cotard patients avoid using and other expressions as much as possible preferring proper names expressions and periphrases This might be taken as further evidence that in their case as well as mineness is lacking More on this below See Billon for a different defence of the simple account Janet quoted and translated by Billon Unless they also suffer from depersonalisation which can happen See e g Soldati Pryor and Goldman among others also argue that there is immediate justification A related notion of immediate justification can be found in Pryor As for some might argue that further beliefs about the regular reliable correlation between experiences and what they represent in the world also need to be in place to warrant perceptual judgements at least as background assumptions I will remain neutral on this point In any case there is no room for a similar worry when we consider or as no scenario of the kind invoked by Cartesian scepticism seems available that would make us doubt the experience as evidence for its own existence for my existence or for the fact that the experience is mine For a detailed presentation of the condition see e g Weiskranz Cf Block Blindsight patients can make correct guesses about the objects in their blind field when prompted but do not spontaneously form beliefs about those objects I am grateful to Conor McHugh for helping me articulate this argument from justification and for suggesting the contrast with the blindsight case which Alexandre Billon helped me sharpen I am also grateful to an anonymous reviewer for prompting me to spell out the argument more fully Were the argument to be found unconvincing please note that this weaken in any way the primary thesis of this essay i e that and mineness are not a set of conceptual equivalents or not they normally As an anonymous reviewer pointed out the distinction between those two abilities might be related in some way to the distinction between the two uses of the first person identified by Wittgenstein namely the use of vs its use Exploring further this connection or the specific way in which each ability is grounded in the subjective character of experience would however take me beyond the limited scope of this essay Links between the built into experience and the capacity to use the first person to have been explored by Shoemaker Evans

elderly patients with hip osteoarthritis aged acetabular dysplasia parameters decreased angle acetabular roof obliquity angle and acetabular head and the incidence of the atrophic type increased Vertebral body fracture was more frequent in the atrophic type suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis at the onset of hip osteoarthritis Introduction Osteoarthritis is associated with increased bone formation at a local site However excessive bone resorption has also been found to occur in the early stages of OA Osteoporosis may be involved in the onset of OA in elderly patients We conducted a radiographic study of patients with hip OA and examined the association between age and factors of acetabular dysplasia angle acetabular roof obliquity angle and acetabular head as well as the osteoblastic response to determine the potential involvement of osteoporosis Methods This study included patients men who had undergone total hip arthroplasty for the diagnosis of hip OA We measured the parameters of acetabular dysplasia using preoperative frontal images and evaluated each patient according to Bombelli classification of OA normotrophic or atrophic Results As the patients aged the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased The incidence of the atrophic type of OA was significantly higher in older patients Vertebral body fractures were more frequent in the atrophic type than in the other types Additionally the index of acetabular dysplasia was lower in the atrophic type By contrast the hypertrophic type was present in relatively younger patients and was associated with an increased index of acetabular dysplasia Conclusion In elderly patients with hip OA the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the incidence of the atrophic type increased as the patients aged The frequency of vertebral body fracture was high in patients with the atrophic type suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis in the onset of hip OA Keywords Osteoarthritis Osteoporosis Acetabular dysplasia Aging International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation Introduction Osteoarthritis is associated with increased bone formation at a local site whereas osteoporosis involves decreased bone formation with increased bone resorption resulting in reduced bone mass Therefore an inverse relationship has been identified between OA and osteoporosis However excessive bone resorption characteristic of osteoporosis has also been found to occur in the early stages of OA drawing attention to the functional unit consisting of articular cartilage and subchondral bone Molecular crosstalk between cartilage and subchondral bone contributes to the pathogenesis of OA Microstructural damage to the subchondral bone and subsequent bone loss by increased remodeling is associated with the pathogenesis of OA drugs such as bisphosphonates are candidate therapeutic drugs with which to prevent the progression of OA However the curative effects of these drugs are controversial The pattern of the biological bone response in OA can be classified as hypertrophic or atrophic based on the presence or absence of osteophytes respectively As a result of the heterogeneity of OA differences in radiographic patterns may be useful in elucidating differences in a reaction to an drug OA is a mechanically induced disease affected by both genetic and acquired factors Acetabular dysplasia is one of the anatomical risk factors for OA and genetic polymorphism associated with the risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip was recently identified OA associated with acetabular dysplasia secondary to genetic factors is predicted to have a relatively early onset In Japan developmental acetabular dysplasia of the hip is reportedly among the most common causes of hip OA Meanwhile the incidence of acetabular dysplasia is lower in elderly patients The incidence and prevalence of OA after years of age are higher in women than in men suggesting that estrogen participates in the development of OA These findings suggest that the etiologic factors of OA in elderly patients may differ from those in young patients and that osteoporosis is involved in the onset of OA in elderly patients However few studies have investigated this hypothesis We conducted a radiographic study in patients with hip OA and examined the characteristic of hip OA in the elderly including the association between parameters of acetabular dysplasia of the hip and age as well as the osteoblastic response to examine the potential involvement of osteoporosis Patients and methods Patients A total of consecutive patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty for OA during the period from January to December at Kagoshima University Medical and Dental Hospital and other participating institutions were evaluated Radiographs and information about the diagnosis were collected from medical records We excluded cases of posttraumatic OA OA after infection or osteonecrosis and previous osteotomy The study finally included patients men were aged years were aged years were aged years and were aged there were no significant differences in the sex ratio within each age Radiographic measurement We measured the parameters of acetabular dysplasia using frontal images of bilateral hip joints taken preoperatively angle the acetabular roof obliquity angle and the acetabular head index were used as reproducible radiographic parameters of acetabular dysplasia The center edge angles showed low reproducibility as the femoral head center could not be precisely determined due to severe deformities associated with OA We also classified the patients according to Bombelli classification of OA type normotrophic type and atrophic suggesting a biological osteoblastic response Bombelli classification was carefully evaluated as described by Saito et al We show typical radiographs of hypertrophic normotrophic and atrophic OA in Fig The Bombelli classification was independently assessed by three orthopedic surgeons with required agreement by at least two When one judgment differed the determination of the other two was adopted The kappa score for and interobserver agreement was and respectively Fig Radiographs of OA according to the Bombelli classification Typical radiographs of hypertrophic a normotrophic b and atrophic c OA We also evaluated patients men years of age years of age years of age and years of age for the presence or absence of vertebral compression fracture and compared these findings with the hip joint findings obtained using Bombelli classification Vertebral compression fractures were assessed by one senior spinal surgeon using a semiquantitative technique described by Genant et al Statistical analysis Single regression analysis was performed for statistical analysis of the correlation between the parameters of acetabular dysplasia and age The test was used as a nonparametric multiple comparison test in each age group The test was also used as a nonparametric multiple comparison test for the results of Bombelli classification The significance level was set at p Statistical analyses were performed using software Saitama Results The mean angles were and in patients aged and years respectively The corresponding ARO angles were and respectively and the corresponding mean AHIs were and respectively As the patients became older angle and the ARO angle decreased significantly R p and R p and the AHI increased significantly R p Namely as the patients became older the parameters of

acetabular roof obliquity AHI acetabular head index p p Discussion We conducted a radiographic study of patients with hip OA requiring total hip arthroplasty and evaluated the correlation between parameters of acetabular dysplasia and aging Additionally we estimated the osteoblastic response in patients with OA according to Bombelli classification As our patients become older the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the incidence of the atrophic type of OA increased Acetabular dysplasia is an anatomical risk factor for hip OA Reijman et al reported that acetabular dysplasia angle of was associated with a increased risk for incident radiographic hip OA Jingushi et al reported that angles of or had significantly increased odds ratios for OA or greater in comparison to However a recent epidemiological study of hip OA in Japan demonstrated that the incidence of acetabular dysplasia was lower in elderly patients Lane et al also reported that the association between acetabular dysplasia and OA in white women aged years was not determined In the present study the indices of acetabular dysplasia in the elderly age groups and years of were significantly lower than those in the younger age groups Additionally these acetabular dysplasia parameters were negatively correlated with age Anatomical abnormalities such as acetabular dysplasia produce abnormal or incongruous loading on articular cartilage for long periods resulting in cartilage degeneration at a comparatively younger age Therefore the incidence of OA secondary to acetabular dysplasia is high in comparatively young individuals but low in those who are older OA secondary to acetabular dysplasia has onset in middle age and induces a brisk osteoblastic response due to the abnormal mechanical load resulting in hypertrophy Meanwhile primary OA in hip joints without anatomical abnormalities will maintain essentially normal cartilage under normal conditions of loading at a younger age but nonmechanical etiological factors such as osteoporosis may cause cartilage failure at a later age Therefore primary OA without acetabular dysplasia shows higher incidence in older individuals and induces a weak osteoblastic response to osteoporosis resulting in atrophy OA is generally characterized by cartilage degradation new bone spur formation and osteosclerotic changes of the subchondral bone However there is little osteoblastic activity in the atrophic type of OA so no osteophytes are observed The atrophic type of OA is associated with a higher risk of joint destruction more rapid disease progression lower mineral density and higher risk of osteoporotic fracture than other types of OA Our data showed that the incidence of atrophic OA was higher as the patients became older In addition the incidence of vertebral fracture in the atrophic type was higher than in other types of OA Schnitzler et al also reported a high prevalence of vertebral fracture in the atrophic type of OA These views support the concept that osteoporosis is involved in the etiology of the atrophic type of OA However a limitation of our study was the absence of bone mineral density measurements Because this osteoporosis study was retrospective we could not collect sufficient data on bone mineral density Therefore we inferred that osteoporosis was potentially related to the etiology of atrophic OA by showing the high incidence of vertebral compression fractures in atrophic OA A prospective epidemiological study to clarify this concept is necessary Osteoporosis may induce microstructural damage to the subchondral bone by increased remodeling resulting in the onset of OA A prospective randomized study of alendronate treatment for hip OA showed significant improvement in pain but no significant prevention of structural disease progression More effective curative results may be expected if the patients are limited to the atrophy type strongly influenced by osteoporosis Microstructural damage to the subchondral bone induces inappropriate crosstalk between osteoblasts and chondrocytes It is probably important to begin treatment for osteoporosis before such events occur When planning the optimal OA treatment strategy it is important that we consider the age of onset and heterogeneity of the etiology Various factors including genetic predisposition sex age obesity physical activity joint injury joint malalignment and abnormal joint shape affect the subchondral bone integrity We statistically demonstrated in this radiographic study that the atrophic type of OA has a predominantly older age at onset and is affected by osteoporosis whereas the hypertrophic type of OA has a predominantly younger age at onset and is affected by acetabular dysplasia Because the atrophic type of OA is not accompanied by anatomical abnormalities it is difficult to predict the onset of atrophic OA before cartilage degradation No serum biomarkers that are able to demonstrate differences between the atrophic and hypertrophic types of OA have been identified Additionally the older onset of atrophic OA may be affected not only by osteoporosis but also by mild acetabular dysplasia Some studies have reported that the patterns of osteoblastic reaction in the osteoarthritic hip were not related to the general bone mineral density The uncertain definition of the atrophic type of OA and the lack of appropriate biomarkers are problematic This study showed that atrophic OA increases with aging Various factors other than anatomical abnormalities affect the pathogenesis of OA Osteoporosis may be a contributor but this remains controversial Pathological classification in individual OA cases may be helpful for selection of drug treatment Further research is needed to understand the difference in the types of OA and heterogeneity of the etiology Conclusion In elderly patients with hip OA the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the atrophic type increased as patients become older The frequency of vertebral body fracture was higher in the atrophic type suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis in the onset of hip OA Acknowledgements The authors thank Mrs Akemi Godai for her
