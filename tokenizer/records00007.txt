effects and to its depressant effects upon breathing Acetaldehyde appears to play a major role in terms of modulating early reinforcing effects of the drug Yet there is no literature relative to the incidence of this metabolite upon respiratory plasticity The present study analyzed physiological and behavioral effects of early central administrations of ethanol acetaldehyde or vehicle Respiration rates were registered at days and time or At all pups were placed in a context where they had previously experienced the effects of central administrations and breathing patterns were recorded Following this test pups were evaluated using and operant conditioning procedure where ethanol or saccharin served as positive reinforcers Body temperatures were also registered prior to drug administrations as well as at the beginning and the end of each specific evaluation Across days breathing responses were high at the beginning of the evaluation session and progressively declined as a function of the passage of time At PDs and shortly after central administration ACD exerted a significant depression upon respiration frequencies At pups with a prior history of ACD central administrations exhibited a marked increase in respiratory a result that probably indicates a conditioned compensatory response When operant testing procedures were conducted prior ethanol or ACD central administrations were found to reduce the reinforcing effects of ethanol This was not the case when saccharin was employed as a reinforcer As a whole the results indicate a significant role of central ACD upon respiratory plasticity of the neonate and upon ethanol s reinforcing phenomena that affect the physiological integrity of the immature organism and its subsequent affinity for ethanol operationalized through procedures neonates ethanol acetaldehyde breathing operant learning Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones y PIP Agencia Nacional de y PICT PICT Introduction Low doses of ethanol g kg combined or not with a tocolytic agent have been employed to reduce the incidence of human preterm births Under these clinical conditions in approximately of the patients uterine contractions were suppressed and a significant number of preterm births were prevented et al According to this study no adverse effects of ethanol were observed Yet the obstetric use of ethanol depending upon factors such as dose frequency of exposure and fetal stage of development has been questioned due to a variety of disruptive physiological effects of the drug upon the fetus Hypothermia acidosis hypercapnia bradycardia hypoglycemia apneas and hypoxia are likely to occur in the developing organism exposed to ethanol Duxbury Abate et al When considering the central nervous system there are also numerous studies confirming disruptions caused by relatively infrequent and small doses of the drug upon a variety of parameters Rat fetuses exposed to low ethanol doses ethanol concentration show impairments in spatial learning accompanied by alterations in hippocampal synaptic neurotransmission et al In rhesus monkeys moderate maternal ethanol consumption g kg ethanol during midgestation to late gestation induces heightened dopaminergic function During a stage in the development of the mouse characterized by a brain growth spurt similar to the one observed during the third gestational trimester in humans and Sands a single ethanol dose g yielding relatively low peak blood ethanol levels is sufficient to trigger a significant neuroapoptosis response and Olney Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that relatively low ethanol doses during pregnancy are sufficient to trigger fetal sensory and learning capabilities with an impact upon later patterns of chemosensory recognition of the drug ethanol odor and taste preference et al Abate et al and sensitivity to the drug s positive reinforcing effects et al Fetal experience with ethanol generates conditioned responses derived from the association between the drug s odor and taste and its motivational properties et al Spear and Molina Molina et al Cullere et al These phenomena predispose the organism to heightened seeking and intake patterns of the drug during infancy and adolescence et al Foltran et al Fabio et al Acevedo et al Epidemiological studies have validated the significant association existing between fetal ethanol exposure and subsequent predisposition to seek and consume the drug et al Griesler and Kandel Yates et al Alati et al Acetaldehyde ethanol s principal metabolite mainly and rapidly forms in the perinatal brain via the oxidative process of the catalase system The activity of this enzymatic system is significantly higher during early ontogeny relative to adolescence and adulthood Maestro and McDonald Gill et al et al When considering ethanol s reinforcing effects ACD formation in the brain plays a critical role et al Hahn et al In newborn rats intracisternal administration of relatively low doses of ethanol or of ACD promote appetitive conditioning et al March et al b Furthermore when considering either peripheral or central administration of ethanol the establishment of early appetitive memories are blocked when sequestering brain ACD via the use of et al March et al b or when inhibiting the catalase system through sodium azide et al Ethanol consumption during pregnancy has also been found to endanger the wellbeing of the fetus and the neonate due to its detrimental effects upon the respiratory system and its a phenomenon that has stimulated research efforts based on the fact that fetal alcohol exposure is a risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome et al O Leary et al In human and ewes the depressant effects of the drug upon fetal breathing movements have been well documented et al Brien and Smith and there is evidence that maternal human consumption of only two glasses of wine during late gestation significantly suppresses fetal breathing activity and Smith Dillner et al In rats chronic ethanol exposure during pregnancy reduces respiratory rhythmic activity in the progeny and sensitizes juveniles to the depressant effects of acute ethanol upon phrenic and hypoglossal nerve activity et al Analogous effects in rats have been recently reported utilizing moderate levels of ethanol exposure during the last days of pregnancy or during the first days of life et al Macchione et al Acevedo et al These stages in development in terms of brain developmental patterns are equivalent to the and human gestational respectively and Sands Indeed we have reported that maternal intragastric g administration of ethanol g during gestational days is sufficient to sensitize the progeny to the drug s depressant effects upon respiratory rates and exacerbate the presence of apneic disruptions that occur without affecting different pulmonary morphometric parameters et al This sensitization process has also been observed when neonates days and were peripherically administered with ethanol g g Furthermore in both studies it was observed that the explicit association between ethanol s sensory attributes and the depressant consequences of the drug resulted in conditioned isodirectional breathing responses et al After systematically reviewing the literature concerning ethanol s central effects upon breathing patterns of the perinate we were unable to find specific literature related with possible contributions of ACD Despite this observation it should be noted that respiratory plasticity is linked with thermoregulatory disruptions Indeed prenatal or neonatal hypothermia can cause respiratory arrests Among the multiple physiological consequences of ACD is the modulation of the thermoregulatory system In mice peripheral administration of ACD causes hypothermia et al Nevertheless there is certain degree of contradiction relative to the prior statement It has been observed that in rats the inhibition of the central catalase system following ethanol administration seems not to play a significant role in the induction of hypothermia et al The first goal of the present study was based on the preceding observations the absence of specific literature related with the central role of ethanol or its first metabolite in terms of disruptive effects upon early respiratory plasticity and a possible association existing between ethanol and or ACD central effects leading to thermoregulatory alterations that may impact upon breathing responsiveness To address these phenomena in perinatal rats it was decided to employ similar central ethanol and ACD doses that have been observed to exert analogous motivational effects et al March et al b A second goal was to further analyze if central to the drug or its metabolite modulate subsequent seeking behavior of ethanol as a reinforcer in an operant task specifically developed for perinatal or infant rats et al Bordner et al March et al et al These goals were sequentially examined As a first step during PDs and pups were intracisternally administered with either ethanol ACD or a phosphate buffer as a control solution and respiration rates were recorded at different times At all pups were to the respiratory testing chamber without receiving any specific drug This particular strategy obeys to the fact that prior experiments have indicated that early respiratory plasticity is also dependent upon exteroceptive ambient cues originally associated with breathing pattern changes Following this testing procedure pups were evaluated in terms of operant responding regulated by either an ethanol solution or a sweet reinforcer The inclusion of this last reinforcer obeyed to the need to control for unspecific learning alterations derived from the preceding central drug administration experiences Body temperatures before and after each specific drug treatment or evaluation procedure were recorded Materials and methods Subjects A total of Wistar neonate rats representative of litters were employed Rats were born and reared at the vivarium of the Instituto de Mercedes y Martin Ferreyra The colony room was illuminated on a h light dark cycle on at an ambient temperature and humidity of and respectively Births were daily examined and the day of parturition was considered day At each litter was randomly culled to pups males and females whenever Throughout days pups were kept with their dams in standard cages that contained water and food ad libitum Buenos Aires All experimental treatments were in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Research Council and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of our institution To reduce confounds between litter and treatment effects and Pearce no more than one male and one female per litter were assigned to a given experimental condition General experimental procedures During PDs and pups were removed from their maternal cages and placed in similar cages partially filled with clean corncob Ambient temperature was kept at via heating pads placed beneath the cages Pups were centrally administered with a buffer solution ethanol or ACD and tested in a plethysmograph at time or min Respiratory frequencies were assessed during consecutive minutes At pups representative of each prior treatment were removed from their maternal cages and kept in pairs under the same holding conditions as in the previous experimental days Fifteen minutes later respiratory evaluations were performed Following these physiological recordings pups were subjected to a minor surgical procedure in order to implant an intraoral cannula that served to conduct operant conditioning procedures defined by saccharin or ethanol reinforcement Body temperatures were recorded before and after each specific physiological or behavioral evaluation Central drug administration procedures Ethanol acetaldehyde and phosphate buffer were administered with a gauge hypodermic needle attached to a length of tubing Clay Adams Parsippany New Yersey connected to a gastight syringe Reno Nevada Fluids were slowly injected into the foramen magnum between the occipital bone and the first cervical vertebra with the needle tip placed mm depth in the cisterna magna PB served as vehicle for ethanol and acetaldehyde solutions The needle was kept in position for s The appearance of a small quantity of cerebrospinal fluid served to indicate the successful placement of the administrations Similar procedures have been previously utilized in different studies et al Petrov et al Nizhnikov et al March et al b Determination of breathing frequencies Breathing frequencies were determinated through a whole body plethysmograph equipped with the software Medidor de Itcom The apparatus was built to record breathing patterns of small organisms weighing between and g It consists of two identical transparent and hermetic Plexiglas chambers that are interconnected via a polyurethane hose system The hose system allows injection and extraction of equivalent amounts of air in both chambers in order to maintain constant and equivalent pressures One of the chambers is used as a testing device while the other serves as a reference box in terms of flow air pressure The plethysmograph records air pressure flow rate differences between the testing and reference chambers These differences activate a pressure sensor with the capability of recording one complete breathing event every s The plethysmograph records the breathing response every s These scores are transformed to mean breaths per minute For each session unrestrained awake pups were introduced into the chambers and the lids were closed One minute after that pups were individually placed inside the chamber respiratory responses were measured during consecutive minutes The minute of delay at the beginning of the test was used to allow air pressure stabilization in the chamber An air conditioner kept the room temperature at during experimental sessions The temperature was kept at to their maternal nest thermal inside the plethysmograph chamber through heating pads placed beneath the apparatus et al The overall procedure has been previously used to evaluate breathing disruptions as a function of and ethanol exposure et al Macchione et al Acevedo et al Body temperature measurements Body temperatures were registered through a thermal infrared imaging camera Exx Series Boston FLIR System Inc The temperature corresponding to the nape of the neck of each subject served as the dependent variable Thermal measurements were taken before and after each plethysmograph recording and as well as prior and following each operant conditioning test Apparatus and operant conditioning test At and following breathing evaluations pups were removed from their maternal cages and were intraorally implanted with a cannula that allowed liquid infusions Dominguez et al Abate et al Cheslock et al Arias et al Bordner et al et al They remained in holding cages for h until operant procedures took place Before commencement of the evaluation animals were anogenitally stimulated with a cotton swab to promote urination and defecation weighed to the nearest g They were then fastened inside a disposable respirator mask dust fume and mist respirator through a restrictor vest expandable enough to allow free movements of the head and limbs The respiration mask was tilted at degrees from the floor surface supported with a cardboard box Arias et al for further procedural All procedures took place at a constant temperature via the use of heating pads A section of tubing Clay Adams Parsippany New Yersey was connected to the end of oral cannula and to a ml syringe Dickinson Rutherford with a needle that was filled with a specific solution and mounted in an infusion pump Scientific Model Holliston The pump was set to deliver of fluid in s directly into the intraoral cavity of a given pup and its corresponding control description Once evaluations begun pups were able to gain access to intraoral infusions of w v saccharin or v v ethanol solution Hnos vehicle tap To this end two and same pups from a single litter with similar body weights were placed in front of a copper sensor cm length cm width cm mm The sensor was cm away from their mouths and perpendicular to the floor while they remained hold inside the mask Each time the animal touched the sensor a red light bulb lit signaling a physical contact which resulted in an infusion pump pulse The apparatus was set to work with two subjects at a time a Paired animal receiving infusions in a fixed ratio schedule and a Yoked control receiving infusions in accordance to its corresponding paired pup Each evaluation lasted min During these sessions pups received a given solution or saccharin contingent upon their operant behavior e sensor All pups received priming pulses at the beginning of the training session and s These pulses were administered independently of motor activity patterns in order to introduce the pup with the reinforcer and to minimally stimulate head and body movements The number of sensor contacts of each Paired subject and its corresponding Yoked control were recorded Similar procedures have been employed when analyzing early operant leaning regulated by positive reinforcers such as milk sucrose and ethanol et al Bordner et al March et al et al Experimental design and data analysis Body weights were analyzed using a mixed analysis of variance Drug treatment at PDs and M ACD or ethanol sex or and time or served as factors Days of assessment and served as the factor A mixed ANOVA was performed to analyze mean respiration rates at PDs where drug treatment sex and time served as the independent factors while days of assessment and minutes corresponding to each specific evaluations represented repeated measures At breathing patterns were analyzed through a ANOVA defined by the same independent factors and repeated measures Thermoregulatory processes were analyzed using a or mixed ANOVA and where drug treatment sex time served as between factors while days and time of temperature recordings and after plethysmograph were considered as variables Relative to the operant task the total number of sensor contacts was considered the dependent variable Separate ANOVAs were conducted to analyze operant performance when either saccharin or ethanol served as reinforcers More specifically a mixed ANOVA was utilized This inferential analysis was defined by prior drug treatments the factor and conditioning status or as the factor Preliminary analysis relative to operant performance indicated no significant main or interaction effects when considering sex as a factor Therefore data were collapsed across sex for all the remaining analyses The absence of sex effects has also been observed in prior studies when employing a variety of reinforcers in operant conditioning tasks during early ontogeny et al March et al et al b The loci of significant main effects were further analyzed with Ducan s tests A rejection criterion of p was adopted for all statistical analyses in the present study According to the nature of the dependent variables under consideration tests were performed using between or within error terms Since there is no unambiguous choice of appropriate error term for comparisons involving and significant interactions orthogonal planned comparisons were conducted when such interactions were obtained All the statistical analyses were performed using the STATISTICA software Results Body weights across days and Data corresponding to body weights across days was analyzed via a ANOVA treatment at PDs and time days As expected body weights progressively increased as a function of F p Duncan s tests showed that pups at exhibited significantly greater body weights than those previously recorded during At weight values were significantly higher than those observed at standard errors of the means for each day were as follows g and g Body weights did not differ as a function of the other factors under consideration Breathing frequencies during drug pretreatment and and test Figure illustrates average breathing responses corresponding to PDs and as a

found to significantly interact with time and minutes of F p Figure Breathing rates as a function of time or and minutes of evaluation Data have been collapsed across sex postnatal days and drug treatment Indicates significant differences between breathing scores at time min relative to scores attained at time and min Indicates significant differences between respiratory rates at minute relative to the remaining minutes of p Indicates significant differences between minute and minute p Vertical lines indicate standard errors of the means According to Duncan s tests breathing frequencies were significantly higher in male than female pups and breaths Relative to the significant main effects of time minutes of evaluation and its significant interaction at PDs and tests showed that breathing responses were significantly lower at time min relative to the scores attained at and min It is likely that the stress related with the intracisternal administration of the drugs affected breathing rates shortly after performing these procedures At and min respiratory frequencies were similar to those reported in previous experiments where a given vehicle g was intragastrically administered min prior to the evaluation et al Acevedo et al Within each test respiration rates decreased as a function of the progression of the a phenomenon probably indicative of habituation to the context This progressive depression was particularly observed in the group of animals evaluated at and min When the evaluation was conducted min after drug administration pups exhibited heightened respiratory rates during the initial minute of the test relative to the remaining minutes This interaction has been depicted in Figure With regard to the triple interaction involving drug treatment time and minutes of evaluation planned comparisons indicated significant differences in respiration rates between and pups during the first minute of evaluation This effect was only observed min after administering the drug At this point in time animals showed intermediate respiratory frequencies relative to and pups Figure Respiration frequencies at PDs and as a

the passage of time Moreover the group of animals previously treated with acetaldehyde during PDs and exhibited significantly higher breathing frequencies relative to the control group This significant difference was observed at minutes and Breathing scores of pups did not significantly differ from or subjects throughout the evaluation This interaction has been depicted in Figure As can be observed pups exhibited during breathing patterns which were opposite to those recorded at PDs and at the earliest time When tested without being administered with acetaldehyde breathing frequencies were significantly higher than in controls while under the effects of the drug and respiration rates were significantly lower Figure Breathing rates as a function of drug treatment ACD or and minutes of evaluation at PD Indicates significant differences between ACD pups and pups to PB administrations Vertical lines indicate standard errors of the means Thermal responsiveness during drug treatment and and test As stated body temperatures of pups treated with PB ACD or ethanol were recorded immediately before and after being exposed to the plethysmograph at PDs and as well as at Table The corresponding ANOVA treatment sex time days of assessment x moment of during PDs and only indicated a significant main effect of F p Thermal temperatures soon after drug treatment were significantly lower than those observed at times and min and Apparently a factor derived form intracerebral administrations was responsible for the significant decrease in body temperature in pups

were not IC administered A similar lack of main significant effects or interactions was observed when processing body temperatures before and after the operant task Table Pup s body temperatures

as means SEMs Body temperatures at PDs and recorded immediately after intracisternal administrations were significantly lower than those registered at or min Operant conditioning at Figure depicts the total number of sensor contacts in Paired and Yoked groups reinforced with either intraorally administered saccharin or ethanol Separate ANOVAs were conducted to analyze learning patterns dependent upon either saccharin or ethanol reinforcement In each case mixed ANOVAs were used This analyses were defined by drug treatment as the between factor and conditioning or as well as minutes of evaluation as within factors Figure Sensor contacts at when pups were reinforced with saccharin or ethanol When saccharin was employed a main significant effect of conditioning vs was observed Indicates the significantly higher level of responding of Paired pups when compared to Yoked p When ethanol served as a reinforcer only Paired pups to PB exhibited significantly higher levels of sensor contacts when compared with the corresponding Yoked controls p Vertical lines indicate standard errors of the means When saccharin was employed as a reinforcer the ANOVA indicated that conditioning exerted a significant main effect F p As can be observed in Figure all Paired groups independently from prior drug experience showed higher operant responsiveness relative to the corresponding Yoked controls This result is analogous to those reported when employing saccharin in older infants et al or when neonates are reinforced with milk et al Bordner et al It is interesting to note that prior drug exposure appears not to affect the learning capability of the organisms nor its overall activity Relative to the activity rate Yoked controls pretreated with buffer ethanol or acetaldehyde showed similar levels of spontaneous sensor contacts When ethanol was employed as a reinforcer not all Paired groups differed from the corresponding Yoked controls The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of conditioning and a significant interaction between this factor and drug treatment F p and F p Planned comparisons indicated that only Paired pups treated with a PB control solution had higher sensor contacts that their corresponding Yoked controls Pretreatment with ethanol or its metabolite appeared to decrease the reinforcement capability of ethanol Once again this effect cannot be attributed to motor activity differences across drug pretreatments that can contribute to the probability of sensor contacts Relative to this issue all Yoked groups has similar levels of activity Discussion As stated Introduction the present study pursued two main goals the analysis of central ethanol and ACD effects in terms of disruptive effects upon early respiratory plasticity and possible association existing between ethanol and or ACD central effects leading to thermoregulatory alterations in neonatal rats and the analysis of central to the ethanol or its metabolite effect on subsequent seeking behavior of ethanol as a reinforcer in an operant task in neonate rats et al Bordner et al March et al et al Ethanol and ACD doses were chosen according to previous literature indicating analogous effects at least when considering the motivational properties of these drugs et al March et al b When doing so during PDs and neonates exhibited a respiratory depression when administered with ACD and tested only min after drug administration This effect was clear at the beginning of the testing procedure relative to control pups administered with PB Pups treated with ethanol exhibited intermediate values relative to the above mentioned groups These effects were observed despite the fact that at this time respiration rates were very low across groups Figure Preliminary pilot studies performed with untreated animals confirmed that the mere handling of the neonates is enough to alter respiratory frequencies when evaluations are temporally close to this manipulation The values obtained in these untreated pups were found to be almost identical to the PB controls here utilized It was also observed that respiratory frequencies increased at and min time and neither ethanol nor ACD exerted depressant effects relative to controls Relative to ACD these null results may indicate that further pharmacokinetic processes g ACD conversion into partially or completely reduce brain concentrations of the metabolite and Didone Zimatkin et al Hipolito et al The fact that ethanol was never found to produce significant respiratory decrements may be related with the dose here employed Under the present experimental circumstances it is not possible to determine whether the dose is sufficient to negatively act upon respiratory plasticity or generate via oxidative processes ACD levels capable of disrupting breathing patterns Relative to this problem and as previously stated it is interesting to note that pups tested shortly after receiving brain ethanol administration exhibited a trend toward a reduction in breathing frequencies relative to controls but not as profound as the group treated with ACD At pups were to the testing chamber without receiving any explicit drug treatment ACD pretreated neonates were found to show heightened respiratory frequencies relative to the remaining groups We cannot discard the possibility that prior administrations of the metabolite disrupted the respiratory system causing hyperventilation Nevertheless a second hypothesis seems plausible The effect at respiration was opposite relative to the one observed at PDs and respiration This apparent contradiction is in agreement with the establishment of learned tolerance to drugs of abuse where conditioned stimuli elicit homeostatic responses that serve to reduce a specific perturbation and Ramsay Some studies have shown that ambient cues associated with the depressant effects of ethanol appear to modulate the effects of the drug upon respiratory plasticity et al Macchione et al Acevedo et al This modulation is related with classical conditioning learning where ambient cues such as the testing environment or a specific odorant g ethanol odor perceived in the amniotic fluid or as an ambient are associated with the unconditioned effect of the drug Similar learning processes have been observed in mice when olfactory cues associated with maternal care resulted in heightened conditioned respiratory responses et al When utilizing peripheral ethanol in developing rats conditioned responses are isodirectional relative to the depressant effects upon respiration In accordance with the systematic review of Eikelboom and Stewart physiological disruptions mediated by the central nervous system are associated with conditioned stimuli which later elicit compensatory conditioned reactivity If the drug acts on afferent pathways of the brain the associative process results in isodirectional conditioned responses In agreement with their analysis and predictions based on specific feedback mechanisms cues associated with respiratory depressions caused by peripheral g ethanol administrations latter elicit isodirectional learned responses et al As observed in the present experiment contextual cues associated with respiratory depressions caused by ACD cause the opposite effect As previously stated thermoregulatory disruptions can determine or modulate respiratory depressions When considering neonatal thermal responsiveness at PDs and it was clear that soon after intracisternal administrations body temperatures were low when compared to those recorded at time or min effects of the administration procedure or even the temperature of the solutions injected into the cisterna magna are factors which can account for this phenomenon As mentioned at the earlier time we also observed very low breathing a result which argues in favor of the modulatory effects of thermoregulation upon breathing Yet drug treatment affected breathing but not thermal a result that argues in favor of early breathing disruptions caused by ACD independently from thermal alterations At when tests were performed without any prior administration procedure temperatures were similar across all groups but as stated ACD neonates exhibited heightened respiratory rates Once again this phenomenon favors the hypothesis that ACD respiratory effects across the experiment were not related with temperature variations Nevertheless when taken into account that the administration procedure does affect thermoregulation and that all breathing tests were performed in chambers maintained at a possible association between thermal and breathing disruptions should not be completely overruled The second major goal of the study attempted to elucidate whether prior exposure to central ethanol or ACD impacts upon operant conditioning processes where ethanol or saccharin serve as positive intraoral reinforcers The results obtained with saccharin confirmed the rapid learning capability of neonates that has been reported when utilizing alternative sweet reinforcer or milk et al Bordner et al March et al Independently of prior drug condition pups exposed to the explicit contingency between sensor contacts and saccharin intraoral administration exhibited relative to Yoked controls a significantly higher number of responses This pattern of results was not observed when ethanol served as a reinforcer Once again Paired pups to the buffer control solution significantly differed from the corresponding Yoked control group As in previous studies neonates without any specific prior drug experience rapidly learn to an ethanol solution et al March et al This was not the case when neonates were centrally administered with ethanol or ACD and prior to the assessment of learning associations When using these drugs Paired pups did not differ from Yoked controls Furthermore Paired pups with a prior history of ACD administrations differed from Paired pups pretreated with the buffer solution As in the case of respiratory frequencies Paired subjects to central ethanol exhibited intermediate levels of responding relative to the two remaining Paired conditions or The results obtained with saccharin indicate that neither ethanol nor ACD altered learning capabilities of the neonates Therefore the absence of operant conditioning observed in Paired pups reinforced with ethanol that were previously treated with ethanol or ACD argues against deleterious effects of these drugs upon the learning process itself Two hypotheses appear pertinent when addressing the lack of significant learning in Paired subjects to ethanol or ACD and subsequently reinforced with ethanol Both of them are based on the direct action of ACD in the central nervous system and the biotransformation of ethanol into its principal metabolite via the central catalase system Favoring the possibility of rapid ethanol metabolism in the neonatal brain is the fact that catalase concentrations in the brain of the newborn rat are approximately eight times higher than in adult animals Maestro and McDonald The first hypothesis is related with prior findings concerning altered motor neonatal activity induced by central ACD administration March et al reported that a single neonatal central administration of ACD exerts a sedative effect upon motor activity Hence it is difficult to discard the possibility that sequential administrations of lower ACD doses or of ethanol into the brain sensitizes the organism to later sedative of effects of ethanol administered during the operant conditioning task Nevertheless this hypothesis is not supported by the following observations When focusing on the motor activity of Yoked controls e number of spontaneous sensor that also received ethanol as a function of the activity of the corresponding Paired neonates no specific effects of prior drug treatment were detected The second observation arguing against the hypothesis is that March et al also found that late prenatal exposure to ethanol generates tolerance rather than sensitization to the depressant of ACD As stated this metabolite is likely to be formed due to brain metabolic processes when neonates were exposed to ethanol during the operant task Yet when considering both ethanol and ACD effects upon operant performance we cannot completely discard an alternative possibility of sensitization effects related with anxiogenic or antianxiety effects of both drugs The arousal state involved in the acquisition of the operant response could be affected by either of these effects Infants are sensitive to ethanol s antianxiety effects et al but there is still no empirical evidence supporting a sensitization effect as a function of prior ethanol treatment during early development On the contrary in neonates exposure to moderate or high ethanol doses seem to potentiate later states of anxiety et al Baculis et al In adults when considering centrally administered ACD inhibition of the catalase system or when sequestering this metabolite the results argue in favor of anxiogenic rather than antianxiety effects et al Taken these considerations into account sensitization to ethanol s or ACD s effects does not seem to adequately account for the described disruptions in operant learning processes The possibility of sensitization to anxiogenic effects of early ethanol or ACD central administration should not be discarded The second hypothesis is related with the consequences of drug upon subsequent ethanol s motivational properties Only one conditioning trial has been utilized when central ethanol or ACD are observed to exert positive reinforcing effects in neonates et al March et al b So far we ignore if increasing the number of doses results in the recruitment of aversive properties of these psychopharmacological agents or maximizes the possibility of an unconditioned stimulus effect that later competes with the contingency existing between operant responses and ethanol reinforcement In either case subsequent ethanol positive reinforcing effects are likely to be devalued Most importantly it is necessary to consider that during PDs and these drugs were intracisternally administered This procedure the additional handling of the neonate and the isolation from the mother can be viewed as significant aversive stressors et al Hofer et al Pautassi et al Hence during these days the effects of the drugs were contingent with aversive an association that may compete with subsequent reinforcing effects of ethanol or its metabolite Notice that whenever to ethanol has resulted in early sensitization to the reinforcing effects of the drug et al Pautassi et al the initial drug experience occurred during late prenatal life via maternal ethanol administration and without any explicit manipulation of the fetus or its natural environment In support of the present hypothesis studies have demonstrated that early in ontogeny the rat is capable of associating different motivational effects of ethanol reinforcing aversive or with aversive and appetitive stimuli such as citric acid and respectively As a result of the nature of the associations the effects of the drug or of the alternative stimuli are reduced or potentiated et al Pautassi et al Cullere et al The proposed hypothesis may also apply when considering the heightened respiratory rates observed in neonates to acetaldehyde The interoceptive effects of the metabolite and were experienced in a distinct context immediately following intracisternal administration of the drug and while pups were isolated from the mother At test these pups were again placed in the context and as stated they exhibited a significant increase in breathing frequencies This physiological reaction under the framework of the present hypothesis may represent an anticipatory physiological response linked with prior experiences involving the context the interoceptive effects of acetaldehyde and different stressors Obviously this hypothesis requires further investigation Beyond these considerations the results of this study argue in favor of centrally mediated respiratory and motivational effects of acetaldehyde during a stage in development comparable to the human gestational trimester To our knowledge this is the first study indicating a significant role of the metabolite upon early respiratory plasticity This phenomenon logically requires further investigation particularly when considering the negative effects of ethanol upon the developing respiratory network Dubois et al In conjunction with recently conducted studies in rat fetuses and neonates et al Macchione et al Acevedo et al the present results confirm that disruptions of the developing respiratory network are attained even when employing moderate levels of exposure to ethanol or in the present case to acetaldehyde Breathing depressions associated with hypoxemia and bradycardia represent a risk factor in terms of hypoxic ischemic effects upon the developing human brain et al As mentioned fetal alcohol exposure also represents a risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome et al O Leary et al a phenomenon that has driven scientific attention toward the effects of the drug upon respiratory plasticity Hence when considering breathing disruptions involved in hypoxic ischemic consequences upon the brain and the need to better understand factors that can potentially predispose to a devastating pathology such as the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome the role of acetaldehyde following ethanol exposure deserves further scientific attention Finally the present study also indicates that centrally administered acetaldehyde impacts upon later ethanol patterns operationalized through operant conditioning procedures From a general perspective these results validate the notions that the metabolite is a neuroactive agent capable of mediating ethanol s motivational properties et al Correa et al and that it plays a significant role during early ontogeny in terms of structuring ethanol affinity et al Author contributions All authors GD OH and meet the following criteria to the conception or design of the work to the analysis and interpretation of data in the

which does not comply with these terms Background Expression of host microRNAs changes markedly during influenza A virus infection of natural and adaptive hosts but their role in genetically determined host susceptibility to IAV infection has not been explored We therefore compared pulmonary miRNA expression during IAV infection in two inbred mouse strains with differential susceptibility to IAV infection Results miRNA expression profiles were determined in lungs of the more susceptible strain DBA and the less susceptible strain within h post infection with IAV Even the miRNomes of uninfected lungs differed substantially between the two strains After a period of relative quiescence major miRNome reprogramming was detected in both strains by hpi and increased through hpi Distinct groups of miRNAs regulated by IAV infection could be defined miRNAs n whose expression correlated with hemagglutinin mRNA expression and represented the general response to IAV infection independent of host genetic miRNAs n whose expression correlated with HA mRNA expression but differed between the two and remarkably and the family whose abundance even in uninfected lungs differentiated nearly perfectly under the ROC curve between the two strains throughout the time course suggesting a particularly strong association with the differential susceptibility of the two mouse strains Expression of subsets of miRNAs correlated significantly with peripheral blood granulocyte and monocyte numbers particularly in DBA and correlated most positively with these cell types in both mouse strains Higher abundance of antiapoptotic g and lower abundance of proapoptotic miRNAs g and those regulating the pathway g were associated with the more susceptible DBA strain Conclusion Substantial differences in pulmonary miRNA expression between the two differentially susceptible mouse strains were evident even before infection but evolved further throughout infection and could in part be attributed to differences in peripheral blood leukocyte populations Thus pulmonary miRNA expression both before and during IAV infection is in part determined genetically and contributes to susceptibility to IAV infection in this murine host and likely in humans biomarkers genetics infection influenza virus lung miRNA mouse susceptibility European Commission Bundesministerium Bildung und Forschung Introduction microRNAs are short regulatory RNA molecules that occur in most eukaryotic cells and may have profound effects on a broad range of biological processes including apoptosis development differentiation proliferation and immune responses It therefore comes as no surprise that major changes in miRNA expression and activity have been shown to occur as part of the host cell response to infection by a variety of viruses Increasing attention has been paid to the of miRNAs in influenza virus infection with most studies having focused on influenza A virus Studies have involved cells or tissues from natural hosts such as humans birds pigs and macaques and mice as adaptive hosts Major insights have been gained by comparing differences in the miRNome responses to IAV strains of differential pathogenicity or by comparing effects of different host backgrounds The importance of some of the differentially expressed miRNAs has also been validated experimentally g Buggele et al thus underscoring that miRNAs may substantially influence the course of IAV infection However in spite of this ever growing interest in the interactions between IAV and the host miRNome there have been no studies investigating differences in the miRNA response in hosts of well characterized differential genetic susceptibility to IAV This is all the more surprising since recent work with inbred mouse strains of differential susceptibility to IAV infection clearly showed that the transcriptomic response to IAV is to a great extent determined genetically It is therefore quite plausible that major genetic differences might also manifest at the level of the response to IAV infection and that the description of this miRNome will enable identification of regulatory networks that are critical for successful host defense against IAV infection and perhaps related viruses Based on a mouse model of IAV infection and using deep sequencing of small RNAs we have therefore used two inbred mouse strains of well characterized different genetic susceptibility to IAV infection to identify host differences in the host miRNA response to this virus We find substantial differences in the miRNA populations of the two strains both at baseline and during infection and an overall more rapid reprogramming in the more susceptible DBA strain The results suggest that differences in abundance and regulation of miRNAs provide a link to host susceptibility to IAV infection Materials and Methods Availability of Data Small RNA sequencing data a miRNA expression table and tables with expression differences and correlations with hematological parameters in peripheral blood including adjusted p values are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository http www ncbi nlm nih gov geo query acc cgi Data tables contain the miRNAs that passed filtering Columns within the table with expression differences represent the effect of infection or mock treatment compared to untreated mice differences between infection and mock treatment at each time point and differences between mouse strains after mock treatment infection or without treatment All results were obtained with the edgeR package Data table contains Spearman correlation coefficients of all miRNAs with peripheral blood indices Statement on Ethics Approval All animal work was conducted according to the national guidelines of the animal welfare law of the Federal Republic of Germany and approved by the Landesamt Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit Oldenburg Numbers and Virus Original stocks of mouse adapted A Puerto Rico virus were obtained from Stefan Ludwig of Virus stocks were propagated in the chorioallantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs for h at as described previously Animal Procedures Infections were essentially carried out as described previously Briefly female to and DBA mice n per time point and were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of g body weight of a stock solution of ml ketamine mg ml Invesa Arzneimittel GmbH Freiburg ml xylazine hydrochloride Leverkusen and ml sterile NaCl GmbH Dreieich For intranasal infection a viral dose of focus forming units in a total volume of sterile PBS was used During the infection procedure mice were held in the upright position and additional anesthetic was reinjected as needed Mock treatment was identical to the real anesthesia infections except that vehicle only not containing virus was used for intranasal instillation Mice were weighed on day just before induction of anesthesia and on each subsequent day Mice were killed by CO asphyxiation at and h with respect to infection or mock treatment Untreated mice were used as t h control Lungs were removed by cutting the five main bronchi and were washed in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent Inc Venlo immediately after removal After transfer into a new tube containing ml RNAlater lungs were stored overnight at and then at until further use Hematological Measurements An analysis of the hematological data from this time course experiment has been published separately Briefly of whole blood were obtained by cardiac puncture and then analyzed with a VetScan Union City CA hematology analyzer RNA Isolation Lungs were homogenized in ml RLT buffer containing and stored in aliquots at After thawing of this suspension was mixed with Qiazol and all further steps of total RNA isolation were performed with the miRNeasy kit according to the recommendations Small RNA Sequencing Five samples per condition were submitted for small RNA sequencing Sequencing was performed using the Small RNA Sequencing Kit Version of January Inc San Diego CA Approximately ng of input RNA was used and the synthesized cDNA was amplified with PCR cycles cDNA library fragments with a length of about nt were separated by gel electrophoresis and then isolated from the corresponding excised gel slice Four to five biological replicates per condition were analyzed Use of the Illumina molecular barcode allowed sequencing of eight samples per lane To reduce batch effects samples from the same time point and mouse strain were never run on the same lane Sequencing was done using the HiSeq Inc sequencer The Small RNA Sequencing Kit is specific for miRNAs and other small RNAs that have a group resulting from enzymatic cleavage by RNA processing enzymes Quantitative PCR Quantitative PCR was performed with a LightCycler Roche AG Basel in plates in reaction volumes using ng cDNA per reaction for miRNAs Reverse Transcription Kit miScript SYBR Green PCR or ng cDNA per reaction for detection of IAV hemagglutinin mRNA Aliquots from the same RNA samples as for the sequencing experiment were used with five biological replicates for each condition HA expression was normalized against the mean of the Ct values of Actb and mRNAs Ct values of the miRNAs were not normalized against an internal control Data Analysis Illumina sequencing data were preprocessed using the CLC Genomics Workbench Bio Cambridge MA and the resulting sequences were annotated using miRBase Two additional downstream and upstream bases as well as two mismatches were allowed and mature sequences were used for further analysis All subsequent analyses were done using the R environment and programming code All p values were adjusted for false discovery rate Two samples were excluded before sequencing due to poor RNA quality quantity and three samples were excluded after sequencing due to low read numbers Thus small RNA sequencing data of of the originally submitted samples were available for analysis amounting to five biological replicates for most conditions but only four for the following conditions untreated mock treated and infected DBA mice and mock treated and mice A total of miRNAs were detected Only the annotated sequences that were detected at a level of count per million in samples were included in subsequent analyses This did not change the number of total reads appreciably Three miRNAs with strong outlier samples were removed because of an SD median ratio with cpm values of mouse strain and time post Line plots of these miRNAs did not show any relevant change in expression not Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using generalized linear models contained in the edgeR package For expression changes within a time course or differences between mock treated and infected mice a fold change of and p value of were used as cutoff Differential miRNA expression in response to IAV infection was defined as follows significant p with respect to the untreated control t and to the mice at the same time point and a FC difference from the untreated mice miRNAs that were differentially expressed due to the infection procedure excluding the virus were defined as follows significant regulation after mock treatment and infection with respect to t h but no significant expression difference between infected and mock samples from the same time point p A FC cutoff of between untreated and mice was used To compare absolute miRNA abundance in DBA vs mice we used miRNAs that were differentially expressed in response to infection in at least one mouse strain and differed between the mouse strains using the more rigorous FC cutoff of and p Furthermore we defined a miRNA subset with no significantly different abundance between both mouse strains at all tested time points p but differential expression after IAV infection in either mouse strain Clusters using for longitudinal data were calculated using the kml package Graphs were made using lattice gplots or Functional Prediction microRNAs that were found to differ between the two mouse strains were analyzed using three different approaches From the significantly enriched pathways we removed those that did not differ from putative pathways of miRNAs with similar abundance in both mouse strains For the first approach we used the DIANA mirPath online tool for annotated miRNA contained in miRBase As settings we used for target prediction with a threshold of Results were visualized with a p value threshold of using the option union This option shows the contribution of each miRNA to the pathways enrichment showing only miRNAs whose targets are significantly p enriched for that pathway From the significant pathways we removed those with a lower number of significant miRNAs for the same pathway in the control group of miRNAs with similar abundance between the two mouse strains For the second strategy we used putative miRNA targets that were found in at least three of four databases PITA miRanda and miRanda miRDB PITA Targets that were shared by at least two miRNAs were chosen for functional analysis Using the R packages and db we identified significantly enriched GO Terms using putative targets of all detected miRNAs as background Of the significantly enriched terms for host miRNAs we chose only those which had at least more targets for a pathway compared to the control group with similar miRNA abundance or that were not found in the control group Putative miRNA targets of step were analyzed using the online tool DAVID for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Bioinformatics Resources and the Mus musculus genome as background For functional observations we used default settings Results of the DAVID tool included a Functional Annotation Table with functional terms for each a Functional Annotation Chart that calculates the enrichment of each term and a Functional Annotation Clustering that clusters Terms that are related Of the Functional Annotation Table we added the options fold enrichment and FDR Functional Annotation Charts were downloaded and loaded into the R program to allow direct comparisons of different enrichment tables To identify functions of miRNAs with different abundance in DBA and mice only those significantly enriched terms were chosen that were found for miRNAs with different but not for miRNAs with similar abundance in both mouse strains or were at least more highly enriched Other Statistical Analyses For pairwise comparisons of miRNA or mRNA Ct values we used Honest Significant Differences Test for homogeneous variances We used a significance threshold of p Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed using the R package ROCR and counts per million data Results Brisker Progression of Infection and More Pronounced Weight Loss in the DBA Mouse Strain Higher weight loss compared to less susceptible mouse strains is a hallmark of the high susceptibility of DBA mice to IAV infection Consistent with our previous observations marked weight loss was observed after infection of this strain which reached a maximum of approximately by day As shown previously weight loss of the less susceptible strain was less pronounced as reflected in a mere reduction by day There was no significant weight loss among the mice between day and Figure Weight loss and expression of influenza A virus hemagglutinin mRNA Weight loss and HA mRNA expression throughout the time course after mock treatment or infection with IAV strain as outlined in Section Materials and Methods Weight loss expressed as the mean percentage of body weight measured at t h before administration of anesthesia No mice had to be killed because of weight loss Data are based on the mice that were sacrificed at the h time point n per Relative quantification of IAV HA mRNA in mouse lung by in the time course shown in panel A dCt refers to Ct reference Ct target mRNA where Ct reference is the arithmetic mean of the Ct values of and As expected HA mRNA was not detected in the mice not Data are based on five mice per group except for DBA at h n Solid lines interrupted lines mock treatment Left panels DBA right panels strain The colored areas around the lines indicate SD Note that the x of the panels are based on different scales p for difference with respect to t p for difference between and infected mice at the given time point This figure is adapted from two articles published by BioMed Central which describe other aspects of this time course experiment Quantitative PCR revealed a brisk rise of mRNA encoding IAV HA in lungs of both mouse strains after infection HA mRNA was detected at low levels as early as hpi in both strains followed by a rapid rise that peaked at and hpi in DBA and mice respectively HA mRNA levels were significantly higher in DBA than in This difference was significant as early as hpi with a ratio DBA to of and increased to a constant ratio of about to between and hpi which diminished markedly by hpi due to a decline in HA transcript levels in the DBA strain by this time point Thus the infection evolved more briskly and peaked sooner in the more susceptible DBA strain with differences manifesting as early as hpi Global Changes in miRNA Expression throughout the Time Course percent million on of all obtained sequences corresponded to annotated miRNAs A total of miRNA species passed data processing and were selected for subsequent analyses In both mouse strains analysis of the selected miRNAs A revealed a narrow range in miRNA expression FC during the time course Accordingly multidimensional scaling Figure revealed that samples from and infected mice at any time point between and h formed two tight clusters for each mouse with the respective uninfected t mice In the DBA mice an apparent weak up and downregulation of some miRNAs due to the mock treatment was seen at h A but this was not statistically significant and there was no apparent tendency toward a mock effect in the strain Thus the infection anesthesia procedure did not induce significant changes in miRNA populations in either mouse strain Of note a marked difference in miRNomes between the strains was apparent even in the uninfected lungs These differences dominated the global differences in miRNomes throughout the time course which remained relatively constant Figure Global miRNA expression changes throughout the h time course of influenza A virus infection Values of all miRNAs that passed preanalytical filtering are shown in panels lines mock red lines change in expression FC was calculated with the R package edgeR DBA strain Multidimensional scaling based on the expression data of all detected miRNAs The data as well as the data shown in Figures are based on five mice per condition except that four mice were available for untreated mock treated and infected DBA mice and for mock treated and mice In both mouse lines line plots A MDS and Euclidian distance dissimilarity analysis data not consistently indicated a global miRNA reprogramming beginning at hpi followed by a pronounced further increase at hpi The overall mean FC was constant within the first h and increased in DBA and mice after h and h respectively As indicated by MDS and confirmed using EDDA miRNome reprogramming at hpi was greater in the DBA than the strain whereas the two strains reached a similar overall degree of reprogramming by hpi Notably HA mRNA expression in DBA mice decreased between and hpi but miRNome reprogramming increased further during the same time frame Therefore host miRNA reprogramming did not seem to be coupled directly to viral HA RNA expression To test whether there was any association between the initial expression level of the miRNAs and the direction of their regulation the miRNAs expressed in DBA or mice with respect to FC FDR adjusted p value were grouped into three clusters according to baseline expression level and direction of regulation Indeed a negative correlation between initial expression and direction of regulation was identified in both mouse strains downregulated miRNAs tended to have a high baseline expression level intermediately upregulated miRNAs an intermediate baseline expression level and strongly upregulated miRNAs the lowest The three clusters converged toward hpi at a point corresponding to approximately five normalized and transformed reads counts per Thus the direction of regulation of the miRNAs depended on their initial abundance These observations are consistent with a model in which miRNAs with high baseline expression are predominantly expressed in resident lung cells but miRNAs of low initial abundance are mainly expressed in immune cells and their abundance increases during infection due to their immigration into the lung combined with the corresponding changes in their activation state Figure Potential contributions of infiltrating leukocytes to pulmonary miRNome reprogramming Line plots visualizing the associations between miRNA abundance and direction of regulation of miRNAs regulated in response to influenza A virus infection different miRNA species FC FDR adjusted p value in either mouse strain see Figure The clusters were identified with the k means of longitudinal data package of R using the FC data of IAV infected mice compared to untreated t mice Correlation of miRNA expression with peripheral blood leukocyte parameters Using data from infected and control mice expression of miRNAs was correlated with hematological parameters of the same mice Significant correlations and p are indicated in different colors according to mouse strain red significant correlation in DBA blue significant correlation in violet significant correlation in both strains The green smoothing line was generated using the R function smooth spline using default settings WBC white blood LYM absolute and relative lymphocyte MON absolute and relative monocyte GRA absolute and relative granulocyte counts To assess the contributions of changes in immune cell populations to changes in miRNA expression we quantified correlations between peripheral blood leukocyte parameters and expression of each of the miRNAs Overall higher numbers of significant correlations were measured in DBA mice red and and blue circles in Figure which was particularly pronounced in total leukocyte and monocyte counts Absolute granulocyte numbers and miRNA expression correlated most significantly in both mouse strains miRNAs with significant violet circles in Figure with and correlating the most positively in both mouse strains DBA There was only a negligible correlation miRNA in DBA with absolute lymphocyte counts To test the above stated hypothesis that pulmonary miRNAs expressed in infiltrating immune cells are initially expressed at low level in the lung we asked whether there was an association between miRNA correlation with peripheral blood indices and initial miRNA abundance Indeed miRNAs that correlate positively with MON GRA GRA LYM and had a lower initial abundance p value Wilcoxon than miRNAs that correlate negatively Taken together these results suggest that expression of pulmonary miRNAs during the first h of infection may be in part explained by infiltration with myeloid immune cells particularly in the more susceptible DBA strain Mouse Differences in miRNome Regulation after IAV Infection As mentioned above miRNAs were significantly regulated after infection The majority were upregulated and only about were downregulated Of note the number of differentially expressed miRNAs and their FC direction was similar in both mouse strains i e miRNAs that were upregulated in one strain were also upregulated in the other and vice versa In both strains a first significant response to the infection was apparent at hpi with a slightly higher number of differentially expressed miRNAs and higher FC values being observed in the DBA strain than in the strain An at least twofold greater induction in J mice was detected in eight miRNAs and Consistent with MDS and EDDA the two strains reached a similar overall degree of reprogramming by hpi but differences at the earlier time points were greatest at h Figure miRNAs regulated during influenza A virus infection Heat map showing all miRNAs that were differentially expressed after IAV infection Materials and Methods of DBA and or mice FC data and p values represent the difference between infected and mice Red blue

DBA strain and in the strain corresponding to a total of regulated miRNAs of these were regulated in both strains p value p value p value Stars are only shown for differences between infected and mice and were also included for significant miRNAs with an FC In a next step we tried to identify miRNAs that might contribute to the differences in miRNomes between the two mouse strains revealed in Figure and thus might affect host strain susceptibility Abundances of a subset of miRNAs differed FDR adjusted p value between the two mouse strains at any of the tested of which were more abundant in DBA and more abundant in mice Six of these were significantly in DBA only and in only Pulmonary expression of eight miRNAs differed between the two mouse strains even before infection Expression of miRNAs differed significantly between the two strains between and hpi expression of miRNAs at hpi expression of miRNAs at hpi and expression of miRNAs at hpi The miRNAs whose expression was lower higher in DBA mice in the uninfected state mainly continued to be expressed at a lower higher level after infection even after days Thus two major patterns could be discerned among the host regulated miRNAs miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the two strains throughout the entire time course and miRNAs whose differential expression manifested at the later time points Most miRNAs of group two were more abundant in DBA mice constituted an exception in that it was markedly overexpressed in mice within the first hpi and had a similar expression level as DBA at hpi and showed the strongest host difference in both directions The DNA Intelligent Analysis the Gene Ontology analyzer for data package and the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery were then used to search for putative mRNA targets of miRNAs whose expression was different between the two mouse strains and the functional pathways putatively associated with these mRNAs Among the pathways relating to immune functions Fc gamma phagocytosis signaling pathway positive regulation of protein kinase B signaling cascade binding and leukocyte differentiation were significantly Figure miRNAs that differ in absolute abundance between DBA and mice Depiction of miRNAs with a differential abundance of and a p value of at between DBA and mice throughout the time course Red colors in the heat map indicate miRNAs that are more abundant in DBA mice blue colors indicate miRNAs that are more abundant in mice The miRNAs that are infection dependently regulated in DBA or mice were used as input miRNAs The blue bar indicates mean miRNA abundance across all samples The FC of these miRNAs at hpi is shown using shades of blue DBA vs ratio i e higher abundance in and shades of red DBA vs ratio i e higher abundance in DBA p value p value p value Stars were also included for significant miRNAs with an absolute ratio There were also distinctive features within each of the two major miRNA expression patterns mentioned above For instance miRNAs whose abundance did not differ between uninfected and incipiently infected mice tended to be more highly expressed in DBA mice at hpi Furthermore seven miRNAs were expressed more highly in mice and were mainly downregulated across the time course and listed in descending order according to the heat map in Figure Although these miRNAs were less abundant in DBA mice they were downregulated even more strongly in this strain In addition the absolute abundance of these miRNAs was relatively high suggesting that they are expressed in resident lung cells and not in infiltrating immune cells Indeed in DBA all seven miRNAs four of seven in belong to the upper trajectory cluster in Figure By using functional enrichment of putative targets signaling pathway Notch signaling pathway hemopoiesis leukocyte differentiation natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and different cancers were among the enriched functions When considering all miRNAs whose expression differed between the two mouse strains nine miRNAs had targets that were significantly in the signaling pathway Five of these and as well as which was identified through literature search belonged to the aforementioned seven miRNAs which were expressed more highly in the mice and downregulated throughout the time course miRNAs That Are More Abundant in the Strain Contain More Putative Binding Sites for IAV RNA To test whether these miRNAs might contribute to the higher IAV resistance of mice we searched for putative binding sites for them in the IAV genome Using the ViTa Database the human homologs of as well as the and families were predicted to bind to viral RNA segments of influenza A Puerto Rico Mount Sinai Most of these miRNAs were more abundant in mice p hypergeometric and might therefore contribute to the higher resistance of mice to IAV infection Potential Involvement of Apoptotic Processes in Susceptibility to IAV Infections Many miRNAs whose expression differed between DBA and mice during infection belong to the and families Of note all three families have been shown to play roles in apoptosis and several publications have demonstrated the relevance of apoptosis to IAV infection We therefore tested whether there might be an association between miRNA expression and apoptosis As shown in Figure miRNAs that were more

in absolute abundance between DBA and mice Data are based on those shown in Figure Red higher expression in DBA blue higher expression in mice Functional information was found by literature research as described in the text above miRNAs with Expression in the Absence of Infection Considering the differences between the pulmonary miRNomes of the two mouse strains even before IAV infection we used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify miRNAs whose expression levels differed consistently between the two mouse strains in the absence of IAV infection and which might therefore be used in the uninfected state to predict intrinsic host susceptibility To increase the sample size and therefore statistical power this analysis comprised all treatments and time points that did not show evidence of miRNA expression changes i e untreated mice mice and infected mice in the first hpi This amounted to a sample size of DBA mice and mice Five miRNAs were identified with areas under the ROC curve indicating that there was no overlap in their expression levels between the two strains and expression of four of them changed during infection In total there were eight differentially expressed miRNAs with AUCs and whose abundance changed significantly during infection Most of these highly expressed miRNAs and were expressed more highly in the DBA strain Overall miRNAs belonging to the family were in this group of miRNAs miRNAs of this family were among the miRNAs that passed initial data filtering Materials and Methods and nine of them had AUCs Taken together the above results suggest that the selective expression of several miRNAs including and the family in uninfected and incipiently infected DBA lungs was specifically associated with higher susceptibility of this mouse strain to IAV infection at later time points and that it accurately predicted this higher susceptibility Figure miRNAs with consistently different expression in DBA and

Validation of RNAseq Results with Five miRNAs were chosen that exemplify three patterns of expression differences between DBA and mice These are comprised of miRNAs with a lower and or higher

expression and any of the hematological parameters Of note expression of miRNAs correlated with HA mRNA expression in at least one mouse strain but did not significantly correlate with peripheral blood cell indices Out of these and were differentially expressed during infection in both mouse strains The results suggest that there was substantial but not perfect synchronization between miRNome and HA mRNA expression Accordingly data shown in Figures and clearly show for instance that in the DBA strain HA mRNA expression peaked at hpi but global miRNA reprogramming continued to evolve through hpi Taken together these results suggest that pulmonary miRNA regulation is not driven by viral replication only but also by aspects of the tissue response including immune cell infiltration that can be temporally dissociated from viral replication Figure Correlation of miRNA expression with hemagglutinin mRNA expression Correlation of miRNA expression with HA mRNA expression using small

regulation of apoptosis and the pathway g Figure thus constituted part of a highly regulated response that can predominate in either strain depending on the time after infection and is likely to play a role in host susceptibility Expression of six miRNAs in the top and bottom boxes right side of the was specifically regulated in the strain and correlated with HA mRNA expression This suggests that they constitute part of the host response specific to this strain that is most closely associated with IAV replication and may contribute to the relative resistance of this strain to IAV infection

having a FC and FDR adjusted p value Materials and Methods The top and bottom boxes on the right indicate miRNAs that are differentially expressed after infection in mice only and whose expression correlates with HA mRNA expression Discussion We have performed a comprehensive comparison of global pulmonary miRNA reprogramming during IAV infection in two inbred mouse strains with genetically determined differential susceptibility to this virus This analysis revealed common and distinct features in the global miRNA expression pattern and specific differences even in uninfected lungs suggesting that host strain resistance susceptibility may be programmed at least in part by the abundance of several miRNAs in the uninfected state Kinetics of miRNome Reprogramming and Role of Infiltrating Immune Cells In both mouse strains substantial miRNome reprogramming became evident only by hpi i e well after completion of the first viral replication cycle In contrast in a related study using the same mouse strains we detected mRNA expression changes as early as hpi This suggests that miRNome reprogramming occurs with considerable delay compared to mRNA reprogramming and may thus be a reaction to and not a cause of changes in protein expression The trajectory analysis suggested that infiltrating cells contribute significantly to pulmonary miRNome reprogramming In addition pulmonary abundance of miRNAs with positive correlations with peripheral blood granulocytes and monocyte numbers initially tended to be low These correlations were most pronounced in the more susceptible DBA strain and immune cell infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung on day pi is indeed more extensive in this strain than in mice These observations suggest a model in which a substantial change in pulmonary miRNA populations is due to immigration of leukocytes into the lung which likely contribute further to changes in pulmonary miRNomes due to their highly activated phenotype in this intensely infected tissue Indeed consistent with reports in IAV in other species several of the differentially expressed miRNAs detected in our study are expressed in immune cells including in peripheral blood Of these expression correlated the most strongly with granulocyte is known to play important roles in the differentiation of myeloid cells including neutrophils By the same token miRNAs highly abundant in uninfected lungs would stem from resident lung cells and their abundance would appear to be lower due to by the miRNAs expressed by immigrating cells Obviously this is a simplified model as some of the upregulation of the miRNAs with initially low expression can also be due to the response of resident cells for instance due to the activation of pathways relating to tissue injury or intrinsic immunity Of note the major features of miRNA reprogramming observed here agree well with our previous analysis of changes in hematological parameters during IAV infection using the same mice Similar to miRNA expression peripheral blood indices granulocyte differed between the two strains already before infection and changes became fully manifest from hpi onward Thus differences in leukocyte number and responsiveness likely contribute to the observed differences in pulmonary miRNA populations The General Pulmonary miRNA Response to IAV Infection The Venn diagram identifies miRNAs whose expression levels were similar in the two host strains changed significantly during IAV infection in both strains and correlated with HA mRNA in either strain Expression of of these was particularly similar in the two strains marked in Thus these miRNAs likely constitute a major part of the general miRNA response to IAV infection in mouse lung irrespective of host genetic background Functionally this group can be linked to general responses expected in an infected organ For instance plays critical roles in lymphocyte development and homeostasis and and the cluster have been associated with immune or stress responses Of note one of these miRNAs well as whose expression in addition differed between the two mouse is among three miRNAs that were recently identified as being commonly regulated in the response to IAV infection in all four species screened i e humans pig chicken and mouse This suggests that part of this general pulmonary response is conserved across evolutionarily diverse hosts of IAV Potential Roles of miRNAs in Susceptibility and Resistance to IAV Infection How might differential expression and regulation of miRNAs affect susceptibility in the two strains used It is not easy to answer this question as any miRNA may have several mRNAs targets more than one miRNA can regulate the same mRNA and both and downregulation of miRNAs may significantly affect levels of a given protein In addition the DBA strain is considered a more host and it is therefore possible that a good portion of the miRNome response in this strain relates to the inflammatory response and not antiviral immunity per se The expression of miRNAs with differential expression between the two host strains correlated significantly with HA mRNA expression suggesting that they closely relate to host susceptibility or resistance The expression of miRNAs that play a role in susceptibility or resistance is expected to correlate with the virulence of the pathogen Indeed changes in expression of several of these miRNAs as well as the and correlate with IAV virulence In addition several of them have been implicated functionally in the host response to IAV or other viruses suggesting that their differential expression in our model is functionally relevant For instance exerts activities by inhibiting histone deacetylase and therefore inducing expression and inhibition of was more highly expressed in the DBA strain in our reduced mortality and delayed death of mice The and families control epithelial barrier repair and regulate multiciliogenesis via the Delta Notch pathway which might help transport virions out of the respiratory tract and reduce damage Of these two the family is of considerable interest with respect to the higher resistance of mice addition to their different abundance in the two miRNAs were more strongly induced in mice suggesting that their higher abundance is less due to mere leukocyte infiltration Differential expression of several of these miRNAs may affect the outcome of IAV infection by regulating overall inflammation has been reported to negatively regulate TLR signaling in murine macrophages dampens inflammasome activity and can inhibit inflammation by targeting However it was more highly upregulated in the DBA strain suggesting that its effects did not dominate Two of the miRNAs and can be linked to adaptive immunity i e T cell activation and regulation of Treg differentiation respectively However taken together the results suggest that immune functions of this central group of miRNAs predominantly affect host susceptibility to IAV infection by modulating innate immune responses and inflammation Potential Roles of miRNA Regulation of Apoptosis and the Pathway in Host Susceptibility The higher abundance of potentially antiapoptotic miRNAs in the DBA strain suggests a plausible role in the higher susceptibility of this strain The IAV protein can activate the pathway which leads to antiapoptotic responses and subsequently higher virulence The higher abundance of antiapoptotic miRNAs even before infection in DBA mice therefore supports the hypothesis that they contribute to host susceptibility by enhancing viral spread In agreement with this model several of the miRNAs with differential abundance in the two mouse strains have been shown to regulate the pathway which relates strongly to apoptosis as well as phagocytosis In particular a subgroup of seven downregulated and abundant miRNAs that were less abundant in DBA mice were enriched for this pathway The protein activates the pathway by binding the domain of and overexpression of heterologous domain has been shown to inhibit viral replication In our study putative mRNA targets were enriched for domain binding proteins and one may speculate that inhibiting expression of endogenous proteins might have a similar effect by making domains more accessible to the NS protein Indeed induction of requires the Akt pathway and is much more strongly upregulated in DBA than in mice Highly Discriminatory miRNAs Of note we identified a group of regulated miRNAs whose abundances differentiated between the two mouse strains before infection and in the earliest stages of infection and might therefore be used to predict the outcome of the infection in the uninfected host The family was strongly represented in this group In addition to its role in apoptosis targets the Lpl gene in macrophages and thereby limits lipid accumulation and cytokine secretion Also can dampen in murine macrophages Thus their likely function in the host response to IAV is to limit excessive inflammation For the other miRNAs in this group reports of functions relating to infection could not be found However they might play yet unknown roles and might be interesting candidates for future investigations regarding susceptibility to IAV infection Interestingly and which by far showed the strongest differences may constitute miRNAs www mirBase org miRNAs with Potential Binding Sites in the IAV Genome The identification of miRNAs whose human homologs have potential binding sites in the IAV genome is of considerable interest These miRNAs were more highly expressed in than DBA mice and might therefore contribute to the higher resistance of the strain Of note as well as some members of the and families were moderately to highly abundant making it more likely that they would bind to a biologically relevant number of viral RNAs miRNAs and Their Counterparts For some host regulated miRNAs such as and we found a high number of validated functions for their counterparts and We propose that the ratio between these forms might also be relevant to their function For example a study found opposite roles of and in that they activated and inhibited type I interferon production respectively In this model predominance of would favor activation of this process Conclusion Using two mouse strains of greatly differing genetic susceptibility to IAV infection we found substantial differences in pulmonary miRNA expression even before infection which evolved further throughout infection and could in part be attributed to differences in leukocyte populations before and during infection Before infection host susceptibility was particularly associated with consistently higher expression of and the family and lower expression of and the potentially During infection susceptibility correlated with a shift toward higher expression of miRNAs inhibiting apoptosis but lower expression of miRNAs associated with regulation of signaling i e two processes known to play important roles in the host response to IAV infection These results suggest that pulmonary miRNA populations before and during IAV infection are in part determined genetically and contribute to susceptibility to IAV infection in this murine host and likely in humans Author

features associated with deteriorated swallow in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with spinal and bulbar onset describe the modification of diet and liquid intake and assess the impact of dysphagia on the use of riluzole One hundred patients were observed periodically every months They underwent routinely fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and dysphagia severity was classified according to the Penetration Aspiration Scale and the Pooling score P integrated with other parameters such as sensation collaboration and age During a mean period of about years the percentage of ALS patients suffering from dysphagia increased to from to in patients with spinal onset and from to in those with bulbar Also of patients with dysphagia by FEES did not perceive the disorder The frequency of normal and diets decreased over time while that of pureed diets and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy prescription increased percent of dysphagic patients refused thickeners or PEG A significant difference was observed in the mortality rate between patients untreated with riluzole and patients treated with riluzole oral suspension p Disease duration mainly impacted on the frequency of dysphagia in spinal onset patients appearing very early in those with bulbar onset Riluzole oral suspension would allow the safe administration in dysphagic ALS patients to avoid tablet crushing and consequent dispersion in food common practices that are inconsistent with the safe and effective use of the drug amyotrophic lateral sclerosis dysphagia riluzole swallow diet Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons that leads to paralysis and death within years from the time of diagnosis Generally death occurs because of respiratory failure aspiration pneumonia malnutrition and dehydration About of ALS patients show a bulbar onset with dysphagia and dysarthria Yet independent of the clinical onset dysphagia emerges in more than of patients during the advanced phases of the disease In ALS dysphagia is related to tongue atrophy dysfunction in the closure of the soft palate and of the larynx due to the nuclear or supranuclear lesion of the cranial nerves IX X and XII and diaphragm dysfunction A prompt assessment of the swallowing function is crucial to organize proper interventions and prevent rapid clinical deterioration Irrespective of the poor prognosis of ALS adequate adjustment of the diet and adoption of postural compensation maneuvers to preserve oral feeding could postpone the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and videofluoroscopic swallowing study are both considered the gold standard to evaluate dysphagia However the endoscopic assessment allows a direct examination of the laryngeal adductor reflex and can be repeated as often as necessary due to absence of radiation exposure Several methods have been suggested for the treatment of oropharyngeal dysphagia in adults to prevent airway aspiration during feeding The guidelines for the management of ALS recommend PEG when the weight loss exceeds of the baseline value and the forced vital capacity decreases below of the predicted level Physiological swallowing is a crucial parameter also for the proper intake of drugs and dysphagia can seriously compromise their effect To date only riluzole has been approved for the treatment of ALS even if its clinical usefulness remains controversial Moreover since a new oral liquid formulation of riluzole has become available in Italy Italfarmaco S p A Actually there are no data describing the behavior adopted by the patients because of dysphagia the impact of swallowing management programs in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation and the use of riluzole in dysphagic ALS patients The primary aim of the present study was to describe the different clinical features associated with dysphagia in ALS patients with spinal and bulbar onset Furthermore we aimed to investigate the impact of dysphagia on diet and riluzole intake analyze the risk of dysphagia in patients unable to recognize disease symptoms and evaluate the effect of riluzole taken in an uncommon way on survival Materials and Methods Study Design and Patients Since an ALS registry has been set up at the Rare Neuromuscular Diseases Center of Umberto I Hospital University of Rome All consecutive patients with a probable or confirmed ALS diagnosis were included in the registry Diagnosis of ALS was based on the El Escorial revised criteria According to the most recent guidelines patients underwent visits every months receiving regular support from a multidisciplinary care team In December we retrospectively conducted an audit of the registry to collect dysphagia data in ALS patients who underwent visits every months to analyze dysphagia onset and severity patient disability diet modification and riluzole management Patients were included in this retrospective study if they had at least three clinical evaluations comprehensive of swallowing assessment and LAR at each visit Patients with concomitant disorders able to induce dysphagia were excluded Participants were divided into two subgroups bulbar and spinal ALS according to the clinical onset of disease These were further classified into dysphagic and treated untreated with riluzole We defined patients as having a when death or survival with tracheostomy occurred during the observational period This study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki The authorization to the processing of personal data carried out for scientific research purposes or the written consent for alive patients was provided by all participants Clinical Assessments At each visit the following assessments were performed FEES to evaluate the swallowing function plus completion of the Penetration Aspiration Scale and Pooling score P spirometry to test the respiratory and ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised to evaluate the functional impairment in ALS Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and LAR performed by an experienced phoniatrician according to the Langmore protocol evaluate objectively the swallowing function A flexible rhinolaryngoscope was used The endoscopic evaluation was performed by checking details of pharyngeal and laryngeal surfaces the competence of the velopharyngeal closure the morphology motility and sensitivity of the larynx LAR and secretion residues The swallowing test consisted in the administration of increasing volumes e and of puree consistency mPa and liquids Penetration Aspiration Scale grades the severity of swallowing dysfunction according to aspiration events It is an scale quantifying penetration and aspiration in order to clarify the depth of airway invasion ALS patients were

as follows patients used whole tablets with water with fruit juice with yogurt and with fruit or crushed the tablets with a spoon and with a hackneyed and assumed the oral suspension available on the market since March Figure Administration of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients according to dysphagia Among the patients crushing riluzole tablets mixed them with water through PEG to

Discussion In this study we evaluated the clinical features associated with dysphagia in ALS patients and their impact on riluzole and food management Our data are consistent with the literature at the beginning of the disease dysphagia was prevalent in patients with bulbar onset and the duration of the disease affected mostly the frequency of dysphagia in spinal patients Swallowing problems are often underestimated in ALS patients due to the progressive adaptation to slow deterioration of bulbar function and the patient does not always recognize the disorder leading to serious consequences and decreased survival Dysphagia needs to be treated early and regularly to prevent complications particularly in patients who do not initially perceive the disorder This ensures adequate therapy through prevention of food aspiration and support of oral alimentation via compensatory postures and dietary postponing PEG In the present study of spinal patients presenting with signs of dysphagia by FEES did not report the disorder as symptomatic These findings emphasize the importance of performing a periodic objective swallowing evaluation in all ALS patients Strategies to prevent malnutrition have a positive impact also on survival and quality of life Recently an important role has also been attributed to laryngeal sensitivity in the assessment of neurogenic oropharyngeal dysphagia Laryngeal sensitivity is crucial for maintaining safe swallowing thus avoiding silent aspiration Until now sensitivity has received limited attention in patients with ALS mainly because of the belief that ALS spares sensory function In our study FEES and PAS were able to objectively assess changes in the swallowing function over time and this was particularly relevant in spinal patients where the dysphagia may not even be recognized In patients with silent dysphagia early detection is critical to avoid complications such as pneumonia The management of oropharyngeal secretion and the efficacy of cleaning mechanisms such as coughing and throat clearing can be assessed simply and directly by FEES Moreover it can be performed at the bedside thus facilitating the examination of severely bedridden or uncooperative patients The AAN practice parameters and European ALS Consortium suggests that nutrition education and management is the standard of care and recommends regular nutrition evaluation every months in ALS patients Treatment of dysphagia is based on swallowing techniques which improve the patient swallowing abilities thus reducing aspiration risks and on diet change to adapt the consistency of foods and liquids to the patient specific impairment The multidisciplinary approach has improved the overall care of ALS patients Nonetheless otolaryngologists are often not included in ALS management until a tracheostomy is considered In our series of dysphagic patients above all dysphagic patients with spinal onset refused requested thickeners or PEG and of them had an impaired LAR Paradoxically we noted that patients who accepted thickening agents worsened more frequently compared to patients who refused them vs An accurate analysis of data however showed that patients had a low level of disability and a better lung capacity This suggests that any person who considers himself really ill makes everything possible to survive Seventy percent of patients who used PEG survived and these data confirm that early recognition of dysphagia and of different grades of aspiration into the airways allows to identify patients who need PEG early on According to the literature patients who were not treated with riluzole died more frequently compared to those receiving the drug even if a significant difference was noted only for patients treated with oral suspension of riluzole Since swallowing a pill is particularly problematic in these patients the riluzole tablet is often crushed and dispensed with food Both practices are not in line with riluzole label instruction and no data are available about the efficacy and safety of crushed riluzole tablets It is also important to remember that riluzole has anesthetic effects as it partially blocks sodium channels and it is usually administered in coated tablets to avoid oral paresthesia Considering the possible larynx sensory deficit in dysphagic ALS patients the practice of crushing riluzole tablets could impair the swallowing ability therefore increasing the risk of aspiration Moreover this potential anesthetic effect could be prolonged if riluzole is dispersed in food given the long time required by ALS patients to finish a meal A comparative study between whole crushed and oral suspension of riluzole on a large number of ALS patients may help to understand the possible conditioning effect of different absorption of riluzole Actually the oral suspension of riluzole allows patients who suffer from dysphagia to receive the only approved ALS treatment in a way that does not alter the drug and is in line with the riluzole dosing instructions Moreover the viscosity of riluzole oral suspension is cP Teglutik Patent No therefore similar to nectar and honey allowing to minimize the risk of aspiration In conclusion dysphagia is a very common symptom in ALS patients The disease duration influences the occurrence of dysphagia especially in patients with spinal onset appearing instead very early in patients with bulbar onset Patients adapt food consistency according to the worsening of dysphagia and they also alter riluzole tablet to swallow the drug The pureed diets and PEG prescription increased over time even if a high percentage of patients refused requested thickeners or PEG despite LAR impairment The oral suspension of riluzole would allow the safe administration of the drug in ALS patients with dysphagia without the need to crush the tablet or disperse it in food practices that are inconsistent with their safe and effective use An early and periodic nutrition assessment and therapeutic intervention is necessary to adequately modify the consistency of the diet and the proper use of thickening agents or PEG Author Contributions EO and MI

this journal is cited in accordance with accepted academic practice No use distribution or reproduction is permitted which does not comply with these terms Seed dormancy is one of the adaptive responses in the plant life cycle and an important agronomic trait Reactive oxygen species release seed dormancy and promote seed germination in several cereal however the key regulatory mechanism of seed dormancy and germination remains controversial Here we focused on the relationship between hydrogen peroxide and abscisic acid in dormant and barley seeds The hydrogen peroxide O level produced in barley seed embryos after imbibition was higher in seeds than in dormant seeds H O regulated the ABA content in the embryos through an ABA catabolic enzyme Moreover compared with seeds in dormant seeds the activity of NADPH oxidase which produces ROS was lower whereas the activity of catalase which is a H O scavenging enzyme was higher as was the expression of Furthermore precocious germination of isolated immature embryos was suppressed by the transient introduction of driven by the maize Zea mays ubiquitin promoter expression was regulated through an transcription factor induced by ABA These results suggest that the changing of balance between ABA and ROS is active in barley seed embryos after imbibition and regulates barley seed dormancy and germination abscisic acid barley catalase embryo reactive oxygen species seed dormancy Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Introduction Seed dormancy and germination are crucial stages in a life In wild plant species seed dormancy plays a key role in ensuring survival by blocking germination until conditions become favorable for the later stages of germination and growth of that species Bewley Unlike many wild plant species cultivated crops such as barley Hordeum vulgare L and wheat Triticum aestivum L display weak grain dormancy at maturity due to selective breeding against dormancy for uniform and vigorous germination on industrial and agricultural fields For malting barley long dormancy increases costs and potential damage resulting from grain storage Carn In addition cool moist conditions in the field can disrupt seed dormancy and cause PHS resulting in serious losses of grain yield and quality Gubler et al et al Therefore research aimed at understanding environmental and genetic controls of dormancy will assist in the development of new strategies for industrial utilization and the elimination of PHS worldwide in domesticated crops Plant hormones such as GAs and ABA play key roles in seed dormancy and germination In particular ABA is considered to be the key molecule in dormancy induction and maintenance Finkelstein et al et al Shu et al During seed development embryonic ABA is required to impose lasting dormancy Nambara and and de novo ABA synthesis in the embryo during imbibition ensures maintenance of dormancy Kucera et al Dormancy release by is mediated by a decrease in ABA content in imbibed wheat and barley grains as a result of the coordinated promotion of ABA catabolism and repression of ABA biosynthesis genes Millar et al Jacobsen et al In several species the transcriptional regulation of cis dioxygenase NCED and OH genes are considered key steps in this control mechanism Nambara et al In barley is particularly important in the regulation of primary dormancy in blue light Gubler et al or at high temperatures Leymarie et al whereas expression has been implicated in the induction of primary dormancy Chono et al and the maintenance of secondary dormancy Leymarie et al The gene plays a major role in that ABA catabolism that is required to alleviate barley grain dormancy Chono et al Millar et al Gubler et al ABA functions are regulated in part by crosstalk with other hormones such as GA and their associated signaling networks Application of GA an antagonist of ABA can break dormancy in cereals Jacobsen et al Tuttle et al Recently it was reported that several signal molecules such as nitric oxide and ROS also regulate seed dormancy and germination Ma et al In barley ROS break seed dormancy and promote germination Fontaine et al Ishibashi et al Bahin et al The relationships between ROS seed dormancy and germination have been described for many plant species including Zinnia elegans and sunflower Ogawa and Iwabuchi Oracz et al Hydrogen peroxide O which is a ROS is regarded as a signaling hub for the regulation of seed dormancy and the precise regulation of H O accumulation by the cell antioxidant machinery is essential to achieve a balance between oxidative signaling that promotes germination and oxidative damage that prevents or delays germination Wojtyla et al These findings were clearly summarized and presented by Bailly et al as the principle of the for germination According to this hypothesis both lower and higher levels of ROS impair seed germination which is only possible within a defined range of concentrations Recent evidence shows that the selective oxidation of proteins and mRNAs can act as a positive regulator of seed germination Job et al Oracz et al et al Bazin et al Bazin et al showed that approximately stored mRNAs undergo oxidation during sunflower Helianthus annuus ROS production during germination contributes to reserve mobilization through oxidative modifications of stored storage organs may then recognize these modifications as signals to mobilize reserves to the rapidly growing axis Due to the abundance of available seed storage proteins the oxidized forms of these proteins such as heat shock proteins and elongation factors can also be considered as actor of ROS signaling in seed germination Job et al et al Oracz et al proposed a mechanism for seed dormancy release that involves a change in proteome oxidation resulting from the accumulation of ROS during the phase The breaking of dormancy by ROS has also been reported in relation to plant hormone signaling in several seeds et al Studies on phytohormone interactions in germinated seeds have shown that exogenously applied ABA inhibits ROS accumulation in barley Ishibashi et al rice Oryza sativa Ye et al lettuce Zhang et al and sunflower et al By contrast the addition of GA enhances the production of ROS mainly superoxide and H O found in radish plants Schopfer et al and Arabidopsis Liu et al Lariguet et al Bahin et al suggested that exogenously applied H O does not influence ABA biosynthesis and signaling but has a pronounced effect on GA signaling resulting in the modulation of hormonal balance and in subsequent germination initiation The modulation of phytohormone balance during germination by exogenously applied H O is also a product of changes in H O levels in seeds treated with GA and ABA Exogenous H O and NADPH oxidase inhibitor increased ABA catabolism by enhancing the expression of genes which encode ABA and enhanced the expression of genes for GA synthesis in dormant Arabidopsis seeds Liu et al and barley seeds Ishibashi et al In barley seeds H O accumulation via superoxide produced by NADPH oxidases promote GA biosynthesis in the resulting GA induces and activates NADPH oxidases in aleurone cells and the H O accumulated by the NADPH oxidases induce in these cells Ishibashi et al Therefore it is likely that ROS is central molecule in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination through GA and ABA However the role of H O interactions with phytohormones in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination is still open to debate The mechanism of dormancy breaking by ROS needs to be examined in detail In this study we therefore focused on the balance between plant hormones and ROS in dormant and seeds Materials and Methods Plant Material Hordeum vulgare L grains which were grown at Kyushu University were harvested on June Experiments were carried out with dormant grains that had been stored at from harvest until the experiments began in order to maintain their initial dormancy Lenoir et al grains were used as controls e grains from the same harvest but stored for months at Germination Test Five replications of seeds each sterilized with sodium hypochlorite were placed on filter paper in a Petri dish to which mL of a solution of mM hydrogen peroxide mM sodium ascorbate and distilled water as control was added The dishes were then incubated in the dark at and the germinating seeds defined as seeds whose radical protruded through the seed coat were counted daily for days Hydrogen Peroxide Content Hydrogen peroxide O content in embryos isolated from seed after imbibition was measured according to the method of Oracz et al by using a assay with acid and mM hydrazone to measure H O et al ABA Content To measure the ABA content in embryos we isolated embryos from seeds that had imbibed for h and stored them at ABA levels were measured by using a Phytodetek Competitive ELISA kit Each experiment comprised five biological replicates Quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from embryos isolated after germination treatment or from embryoless by using the SDS phenol LiCl method Chirgwin et al cDNA synthesis and amplification were conducted as described by Ishibashi et al The amount of each gene transcript was normalized against the amount of mRNA for HvActin Trevaskis et al by using the method of Pfaffl The sequences for the HvActin primer came from Ishibashi et al the other primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table Barley Transient Expression Assay The plasmid was transformed by particle bombardment into immature embryos according to the method of Pellegrineschi et al and Nakamura et al For this assay H vulgare L immature grains which were grown at Kyushu University were harvested and immature embryos isolated from the immature grain The immature embryos were bombarded with each plasmid Ubi HvCAT or Ubi GUS which was constructed to express each gene under the control of the promoter region and the first intron of the maize ubiquitin gene Toki et al Christensen and Quail After bombardment the immature embryos were transferred to medium containing mg L MES and g L maltose and were incubated at for days We checked introduction of each genes using Figure Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay The EMSA was performed as described by Wang et al Recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli pLysE The E coli cells were lysed by sonication and purified with beads oligonucleotide spanning the ACGT core motif upstream of was prepared and carried out labeling according to the protocol provided with the DIG Kit EMSAs were carried out using a DIG Gel Shift kit Generation according to the instructions The primer sequences for constructing the vector and the probe sequences for the EMSA are shown in Supplementary Table Enzyme Activities To measure enzyme activities we isolated embryos from seeds that had imbibed for h and stored them at The enzyme activities of APX GPX SOD and CAT were measured as described by Ishibashi et al NADPH oxidase activity was assayed according to the method of Van Gestelen et al and Sarath et al Protein concentration was determined by using the method Bradford The results are expressed as mg protein Results Germination Rate and Hydrogen Peroxide Content of Dormant and Seeds seeds had a germination rate of at day after imbibition and had germinated at DAI Dormant seeds had a germination rate of and at and DAI respectively Figure At DAI the H O content in the seeds was higher six times that in the dormant seeds Figures C In addition nine barley cultivars that were at different stages of dormancy had positive correlations with the H O contents of their embryos after imbibition Figure These data strongly suggest that seeds accumulate H O in the embryo after imbibition but dormant seeds do not FIGURE Germination percentage and hydrogen peroxide content in dormant and seeds Time course of the percentage of germination of dormant and seeds Embryos removed from dormant and seeds after imbibition were used to determine hydrogen peroxide contents n Hydrogen Peroxide and Sodium Ascorbate Regulate Barley Seed Germination through ABA Catabolism The germination rate of dormant seeds treated with H O was significantly higher than that of the control Figure In contrast the germination rate of seeds treated with sodium ascorbate was significantly lower than that of the control Figure In addition H O and sodium ascorbate treatments were increased and decreased the H O contents in the embryos after imbibition respectively Figure We previously reported that a decrease in ROS induced by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI in the embryos of barley seeds suppressed ABA catabolism in those embryos after imbibition Ishibashi et al Therefore we examined ABA content and biosynthesis as well as the expression of ABA genes in the embryos of dormant or seeds treated with sodium ascorbate or H O respectively In the dormant seeds the ABA content of the embryos treated with H O was significantly decreased compared with that in the control Figure In the seeds the ABA content of the embryos treated with sodium ascorbate was significantly higher than that in the control Figure The expression of one of the ABA genes and a key gene regulating primary dormancy of barley Millar et al in the embryos did not differ significantly regardless of dormancy or treatment Figures F However the expression of one of the ABA genes and a key gene regulating primary dormancy of barley Millar et al in the embryo was suppressed by sodium ascorbate in the seeds and increased by H O in the dormant seeds Figures H These results indicate that ROS regulate ABA catabolism in the embryos of and dormant seeds by regulating FIGURE Germination rate ABA contents and expression of ABA genes in dormant and seeds Embryos removed from seeds after h imbibition were used to determine ABA contents and gene expression Germination rate after h ABA expression control mM hydrogen mM sodium ascorbate P test n Activities of Antioxidant Enzymes and NADPH Oxidase in the Embryos of and Dormant Seeds Then we examined the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as APX GPX SOD and CAT as well as the activity of NADPH oxidase Figure because the H O contents of the embryos during germination were higher in seeds than in dormant seeds Figure APX activity in the embryos of dormant seeds was significantly higher than that of the embryos of seeds Figure although GPX activity was the same in the embryos of both and dormant seeds Figure In contrast SOD and CAT activities in the embryos of dormant seeds were significantly lower than those in the embryos of seeds Figures D We previously reported that NADPH oxidase plays a role in barley seed germination through the regulation of GA and ABA signaling Ishibashi et al Therefore we examined NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of dormant and seeds Figure NADPH oxidase activity was significantly higher in seeds than in dormant seeds These results suggest that the production of ROS in the embryos of barley seeds after imbibition is regulated by SOD CAT and NADPH oxidase FIGURE Activity of antioxidant enzymes and NADPH oxidase in dormant and seeds Embryos removed from seeds after h imbibition were used NADPH oxidase D dormant ND seed P test n Transient Expression of CAT in Immature Embryos Decreases Their Ability to Germinate We examined the expression of HvSOD and HvCAT in the embryos of and dormant seeds After h imbibition the expression of HvSOD and was increased in the embryos of dormant seeds compared with that in the embryos of seeds Figures C while after h imbibition the expression of HvSOD and were high in the embryo of and dormant seeds respectively Figures D SOD catalyzes the reduction of the superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and CAT catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water In wheat the expression of CAT in dormant seeds was higher than that in seeds during seed maturation Ishibashi et al In sunflower seed relationship between CAT activity and germination is a quite close Bailly et al Additionally Bahin et al have reported that the CAT regulates hydrogen peroxide content in embryo of barley dormant seed Therefore we focus on the role of CAT in barley seed dormancy and germination To examine the function of which directly scavenges hydrogen peroxide in barley seed germination we transiently overexpressed in immature embryos and examined their germination driven by the maize Zea mays ubiquitin promoter was directly bombarded into immature embryos isolated from Himalaya seeds at approximately days after anthesis In general cultured immature wheat embryos germinate precociously Williamson et al However we observed a significant decrease in the germination percentage of immature embryos that were transformed with Ubi Figure In contrast immature embryos transformed with the control construct driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter germinated well Figure Nakamura et al previously reported that the Ubi TaMFT construct in a similar transient assay completely suppressed the germination of immature embryos of wheat because the TaMFT protein moved from the scutellum and coleorhiza to other parts of the seed The partial effect of Ubi in our study was likely caused by scavenging H O which across cell membranes in plants Hooijmaijers et al even though cannot move from the scutellum and coleorhiza to other parts of the seed FIGURE Expression of HvSOD and in dormant and seeds and the germination percentage in the transient expression assay Embryos removed from seeds after h and h imbibition were used to determine gene expression levels HvSOD expression Time course of the germination percentage after transformation with Ubi or Ubi GUS The barley cultivar Himalaya was used D dormant ND seed P P test n ABA Regulates the Expression of through Abscisic acid significantly increased the expression of in the barley seed embryo Figures B To explore the underlying mechanisms by which ABA regulates the expression of during seed germination we analyzed the promoter sequences of and found an ABA response element which is a cis element recognized by several bZIP transcription factors such as and that function in ABA signal transduction Figure Finkelstein and Lynch These bZIP transcription factors mediate downstream gene expression in Arabidopsis upon binding to the ABRE Furihata et al Yoshida et al Our finding suggests that the expression of may be regulated by bZIP transcription factors involved in ABA signaling Indeed the expression of in the barley seed embryo was increased by ABA Figures D Therefore to test this possibility we used EMSA analyses to investigate whether directly binds to the promoter of containing the ABRE element Figure The recombinant protein of showed binding activities to promoter fragment and the activity was suppressed by competitor FIGURE Expression of and in seeds treated with ABA and the direct interaction between and the promoter as determined by EMSA Embryos removed from seeds after h and h imbibition were used to determine gene expression levels The retarded complex was reduced by competition using either the or the unlabeled probes at a molar excess The arrows indicate the positions of the shifted bands and free probes respectively P test n Discussion The present study demonstrates that the balance between ABA and ROS in the barley seed embryo is involved in the regulation of seed dormancy and germination The first line of evidence supporting this conclusion is the relationship between seed dormancy and H O level because the degree of seed dormancy was dependent on the H O levels in the embryo after imbibition Figure and Supplementary Figure Additionally germination rate of dormant seeds were promoted by H O and suppressed by sodium ascorbate while that of seeds were suppressed by sodium ascorbate but not promoted by H O Figure and Supplementary Figure There have been several reports about the relationship between ROS and seed dormancy and germination many of which are focused on phytohormone signaling and ROS involvement Oracz and H O has been implicated in dormancy alleviation via its activation of GA signaling and synthesis rather than repression of ABA signaling Bahin et al In sunflower seed however ROS interact at the transcriptional level with the ABA signaling pathway et al We previously reported that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase in the embryos of barley seeds promoted the catabolism of ABA Ishibashi et al In the present study NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of seeds was higher than that in the embryos of dormant seeds Figure In seeds ABA content in the embryos treated with ascorbate was higher than that in treated with distilled water whereas in dormant seeds the ABA content in the embryos treated with H O was lower than in treated with distilled water Figures D In addition the regulation of ABA in the embryos of both dormant and seeds could be attributed to the induction of by ROS Figures H Two genes encoding have been identified in barley and is predominantly expressed in the embryos of imbibing seeds Millar et al Of note expression is closely associated with ABA level and germination capacity Chono et al Consistent with these facts the knocking down of leads to increased seed ABA levels and to enhanced dormancy Gubler et al ROS produced after imbibition is involved in the regulation of barley seed dormancy and germination through the catabolism of therefore we focused on the mechanism of ROS production It had been reported that ROS generated by NADPH oxidases regulate barley seed germination through GA ABA metabolism and signaling in the embryo and aleurone cells Ishibashi et al In the present study H O content and NADPH oxidase activity in the embryos of dormant seeds were lower than those in the embryos of seeds Figures C In the embryos of barley seeds ABA suppressed the activity of NADPH oxidases Ishibashi et al The decrease in ABA content by catabolism in the embryo after imbibition is promoted by ROS production through NADPH oxidase In Arabidopsis ABA treatment induces the expression of NADPH oxidases AtrbohD and AtrbohF in guard cells Kwak et al The ROS enhanced by NADPH oxidase could result in enhanced ABA accumulation whereas enhanced ABA could result in enhanced ROS production in guard cells creating a positive feedback loop to mediate stomatal closure Mittler and Blumwald Our results indicate that in the embryo after imbibition ROS and ABA act antagonistically to regulate seed dormancy and germination although this suggestion is inconsistent with other reports In this study we also examined the activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD CAT and peroxidases that can scavenge ROS The CAT activities in the embryos of the dormant seeds were significantly higher than those in the embryos of the seeds Figure These results suggest that the H O contents in the embryos of dormant and seeds depend on CAT activity CAT is reported to play an important role in the seed germination process CAT expression levels increase in germinating sunflower seeds prior to radicle protrusion with a concomitant decrease in H O content Bailly A similar increase in CAT activity has been described during the germination of maize soybean Arabidopsis and sweet corn seeds Puntarulo et al Gallardo et al Posmyk et al Chiu et al In dormant barley seeds H O treatment induced an increase in CAT activity that was associated with accumulation of the transcript in the embryos Bahin et al Barley has two CAT isozymes and however was not expressed in our embryos not In the present study the expression of in the embryos of dormant seeds was significantly higher than in those of seeds Figure In nine cultivars that were at different stages of dormancy expression correlated with the germination index except for one cultivar Figure In addition precocious germination of isolated immature embryos was suppressed by the transient introduction of driven by the maize Zea mays ubiquitin promoter Figure These results indicated that CAT is involved in germination of barley seed after imbibition through the regulation of ROS The expression of was suppressed by ABA Figures B also Bahin et al therefore we investigated the promoter sequence of The promoter sequence included an element an coupling element and RY repeat motifs Figure Interestingly the promoter of which regulates rice seed dormancy has seven RY repeats which are important for gene expression and are the target of the subfamily of domain transcription factors Baumlein et al along with the ABRE and CE Sugimoto et al The dormancy state is characterized by the transcription of genes with large numbers of ABRE sequences to which transcription factors like bind to regulate seed dormancy and In the present study the expression of in the embryos was increased by ABA Figure but not not Moreover we determined that recombinant binds to the promoter including the ABRE Figure These results suggest that the expression of is regulated through induced by ABA Bahin et al suggested that H O plays a role in the alleviation of barley seed dormancy through the activation of GA signaling and or biosynthesis rather than through the inhibition of ABA signaling They found that exogenously applied H O does not influence ABA biosynthesis and signaling but does have a pronounced effect on GA signaling resulting in the modulation of hormonal balance and in subsequent germination initiation However by using dormant and seeds in this study we found that H O regulated ABA content through catabolism of ABA Figures D G H Liu et al proposed a hypothetical model that explains the interrelationships between H O and NO in the regulation of Arabidopsis seed germination in terms of the joint actions of ABA and GA According to this model H O can interrupt the dormancy of Arabidopsis seeds through two pathways The first pathway relies on the enhancement of ABA catabolism and GA biosynthesis The signaling molecule does not regulate GA biosynthesis directly but instead acts as a temporary signaling molecule involved in the H O regulation of ABA catabolism The second pathway assumes negative regulation of GA biosynthesis by ABA We previously reported that ROS induced by NADPH oxidase regulate barley seed germination by promoting ABA catabolism and GA biosynthesis Ishibashi et al Our results in this study suggest that dormant seeds maintain high ABA contents promoting expression through for H O catabolism In addition ABA catabolism through was promoted by H O Therefore dormant seeds had low ROS contents with decreased expression which maintained high ABA contents Taken together our findings suggest that the interrelationship between ABA and ROS may play an important role in seed dormancy and germination as shown in Figure although it should also be added that the mechanism might be included in seedling stage FIGURE The interrelationship between ABA and ROS involved in

cells have been also successfully used in the treatment of diseases such as synovitis or arthritis In the last years the exosomes derived from MSCs have become a promising tool for the treatment of diseases and their therapeutic effect is thought to be mediated least in by their immunomodulatory potential In this work we aimed to evaluate the effect of these exosomes in an synovitis animal model To our knowledge this is the first report where exosomes derived from MSCs have been evaluated in an animal model of synovitis Our results demonstrated a decrease of synovial lymphocytes together with a downregulation of transcripts in those joints These results support the immunomodulatory effect of these exosomes and point out that they may represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of synovitis exosomes mesenchymal stem cells synovitis immunomodulation inflammation Introduction Osteoarticular disorders are the major cause of disability in western countries causing pain discomfort disability and affecting the quality of life of millions of people Osteoarticular disorders are usually linked to joint inflammation and accompanied by redness swelling and pain This local inflammation is provoked by different causes such as trauma injuries microorganism infections or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis The inflammation of the synovium around a joint also called synovitis is frequently observed in the early phase of osteoarthritis and in clinically active rheumatoid arthritis patients One of the consequences of persistent synovitis is the cartilage matrix degradation and alterations in chondrocyte function Moreover synovitis causes hypoxia and acidity in synovial fluid and subchondral bone and enhances angiogenesis The treatments to reduce pain and swelling for transient synovitis includes agents such as drugs and or corticosteroids treatments such as hip aspiration as well as rest ice compression and elevation are extremely helpful and effective in the treatment of synovitis Additionally intrasynovial injections of biologically based therapies such as plasma and autologous conditioned serum have been found to be very effective Local or systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cell therapies has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of diseases These cells have an immunomodulatory potential on cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and recent clinical trials have demonstrated very promising results for the treatment of osteoarticular diseases In the case of synovitis the therapeutic use of MSCs has also been evaluated in veterinary medicine specifically in horses with injections of xenogeneic allogeneic and autologous MSCs Moreover in a recent randomized and blinded study using a synovitis model equine allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells could reduce the nucleated cell counts in SF Accumulative evidences have established that the effect of MSC transplantation is thought to be mediated in part by a paracrine effect In this sense the use of exosomes derived from MSCs referred has become a promising tool for the treatment of diseases Exosomes are small membranous vesicles secreted by most cell types These vesicles participate in communication and their content consists on RNA lipids and proteins Some of these proteins e or are ubiquitously expressed but depending on the cell source cell proteins can be found being responsible of their functionality The proteins lipids and RNA expression of exosomes from different cells and organisms are extensively described in ExoCarta database Previous studies from our group have reported that exerted an immunomodulatory potential against in vitro activated T cells Additionally several evidences have shown that could play active roles in promoting angiogenesis antiapoptotic effect as well as in cell proliferation In the last years the therapeutic potential of has been demonstrated in animal models Very promising results have been obtained in small animal models for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where showed a reduction of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury In renal fibrosis where the secreted by the exosomes attenuated renal fibrosis In wound healing where released exosomes promoted angiogenesis In necrotizing enterocolitis where exosomes from bone stem cells protected the intestines In acute lung injury where the exosomes maintain the functional phenotype of the parent cell In postischemic neurological impairment where extracellular vesicles induce neuroprotection neuroregeneration and neurological recovery Finally it is important to note that although the therapeutic effect of has been widely studied in small animals only a few studies have evaluated their therapeutic effect in large animal models In summary although the therapeutic effect of MSCs in osteoarticular diseases is widely accepted the hypothetical beneficial effect of in joint inflammation has not been evaluated This paper aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of in a clinically relevant animal model of synovitis The analysis of leukocytes lymphocytes and inflammatory cytokines in SF revealed a potential therapeutic effect of in the setting of inflammatory and osteoarticular disorders Materials and Methods Animals and Ethical Issues Eight large white

the median Measurements compared in a paired t Discussion Synovitis is an inflammation of the synovial membrane usually linked to osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis or infections It can be successfully treated with biologically based therapies such as plasma or autologous conditioned serum or NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen or Naproxen The therapies diminish the inflammatory response itself and the administration of MSCs has been found to reduce the nucleated cell counts in SF Many authors have hypothesized that therapies may be safer and affordable than therapies In this sense have been considered as agents and a therapeutic alternative to therapies The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of in a large animal model of synovitis In this sense our first sets of experiments were conducted to create an synovitis in a porcine model This animal model has been immunologically characterized and our experience has demonstrated that it is particularly attractive in preclinical settings especially to evaluate the safety feasibility and dosage pattern of new therapies for synovitis The used in this study were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow cytometry The mean size of these exosomes was nm Although this size is larger to classically defined exosomes it has been found that in aqueous solution exosomes are surrounded by a surface charge that may be the responsible for this larger size This phenomenon has been previously described for nanoparticle tracking analyzed exosomes Moreover and due to the lack of porcine antibodies for and used for exosomes and surface markers have been used to identify extracellular vesicles In our synovitis model a subcutaneous with BSA was required before the injection of BSA This induced a potent humoral response which was found to be as effective as previously described synovitis in rabbits and dogs These animals received an injection of BSA which triggered a local inflammatory response with a significant increase of WBCs in SF It is important to note that the WBC count is one of the most frequent tests in the analysis of SF In this sense human SFs with less than cells are classified as and those with less than cells are classified as In our synovitis model those animals that received an injection of BSA showed a WBC infiltration that can be classified as Once demonstrated that BSA triggered a local inflammatory reaction we aimed to counteract this reaction by an administration of As shown in the results section no differences were found in terms of WBCs when were with BSA However the differential cell count of leukocytes showed statistically significant differences in the lymphocyte counts being lower in those joints where BSA was with Based on that here we assume that efficiently counteracted the T cell response and point out that these exosomes may represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis These in vivo results are in agreement with in vitro results using stimulated T cells with human exosomes from stem cells In these studies the effect of on proliferative differentiation and functional behavior of T cells was significantly modified by exosomes Additionally here we hypothesized that exosomes may also inhibit or decrease the production of cytokines In order to evaluate the inflammatory reaction after BSA injections a analysis was performed for several cytokines and This analysis revealed some differences in and after injections of BSA with PBS or with The is a critical mediator of osteoarthritis and the injection of this recombinant cytokine has been used to induce a transient inflammatory response in an experimentally induced synovitis In the case of this chemokine participates to the inflammatory process in the early synovitis of rheumatoid arthritis and similar to the administration has been also used to induce acute synovitis in rabbits Finally the level of in synovia has been correlated with pain and disease progression and agents have been widely used for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis Based on the relations between and synovitis progression we aimed to quantify their gene expression in SFs when were in the joints Uniquely the level was found to be statistically decreased by the of We suggest that this result is very relevant considering that is a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases Indeed targeted treatments against synovitis and rheumatoid arthritis have been efficiently developed against this cytokine Regarding to the not statistically significant increase of observed with it is important to note that this chemokine is abundantly secreted by MSCs from adipose tissue and bone marrow More importantly this chemokine has been found to be contained in exosomes derived from umbilical as well as in menstrual Based on these observations we assume that the increase of is the consequence of an exogenous administration of linked to Additionally taking into account that is one of the most potent chemoattractant molecule for neutrophils this may also explain the increase not of infiltrated neutrophils in SFs treated with It is important to note that the determination of the different cytokines in SF was firstly addressed with a multiplexed immunoassay by Luminex xMAP technology using the ProcartaPlex Porcine Cytokine and Chemokine Panel San Diego CA The following cytokines were measured and The cytokine analysis demonstrated that probably because of the detection limit of commercially available swine immune reagents or because the evaluation time point was too short for protein translation eight out of nine cytokines were undetectable in SFs with this technique Uniquely the could be detected in all the samples but no differences were found between groups Although this paper has not been focused on the biological mechanisms which promote the decrease of in the synovitis model the bibliography has several references that support the association between and As an example recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from human umbilical cord MSCs reduced the release from PBLs Moreover exosomes from bone MSCs also suppressed the secretion of from T cells More recently the immunomodulatory effect of these exosomes against transcription was demonstrated in vivo in an experimental colitis model In this animal model the intravenous injection of exosomes from bone MSCs reduced the in injured colon Altogether these in vitro and in vivo studies are in agreement with our results and support the immunomodulatory effect of these exosomes in the animal model Finally this paper aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of in a functional kinetic assessment Apart from the analysis of synovial leukocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines in the animal model different kinetic parameters such as stance time swing time stride time vertical maximum force and impulse were monitored in the animal model by PP gait analysis The quadruped gait analysis demonstrated that with the BSA had a trend for the improvement of the impulse This trend may indicate a pain reduction linked to the effect of Finally it is important to note that the absence of statistical differences would not necessarily imply that the kinetic was since the pressure gait was performed under analgesia due to ethical consideration and animal welfare guidelines In the same way due to ethical limitations animals could only be evaluated at day after treatment In this sense this study can be considered a preliminary approach and further studies will be performed to evaluate the changes in a study including the histological of the lesions as well as the cytokine quantification using immunoassays In conclusion to our knowledge this is the first report describing the use of for the treatment of synovitis in a large animal model The decrease of synovial lymphocytes the downregulation of transcripts as well as the trend to improve the impulse in joints point out that exosomes may represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of synovitis Author

a century the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a valuable tool in our understanding of fundamental biological processes and has empowered our discoveries particularly in the field of neuroscience In recent years Drosophila has emerged as a model organism for human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders In this review we highlight a number of recent studies that utilized the Drosophila model to study associated diseases such as polyglutamine diseases fragile tremor ataxia syndrome myotonic dystrophy type and type and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal dementia Discoveries regarding the possible mechanisms of RNA toxicity will be focused here These studies demonstrate Drosophila as an excellent in vivo model system that can reveal novel mechanistic insights into human disorders providing the foundation for translational research and therapeutic development polyglutamine disease Huntington s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal dementia myotonic dystrophy fragile X spinocerebellar ataxia Research Grants Council University Grants Committee CRF Chinese University of Hong Kong Chow Tai Fook Charity Foundation Hong Kong Spinocerebellar Ataxia Association Introduction For nearly two decades the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been utilized as a model organism to study a number of human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases and Bonini Muqit and Feany Zoghbi and Botas Sang and Jackson Marsh and Thompson Yu and Bonini Jaiswal et al McGurk et al The fruit fly offers multiple advantages for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of diseases Having short life cycle high offspring numbers low costs for maintenance simple yet powerful genetic manipulations the availability of mutants and other genetic tools are only some of the many attractive features of Drosophila as a model system Drosophila was introduced into scientific research over a years ago and quickly became an invaluable tool that empowers our discoveries and understanding of a wide range of biological processes such as embryogenesis neural development synaptic plasticity and even complex behaviors such as and learning and memory et al Spindler and Hartenstein Harris and Littleton Sequencing of the Drosophila and the human genomes revealed remarkably high similarities between the fly and humans et al Rubin with of the genes implicated in human genetic disorders having at least one homolog in Drosophila Reiter et al Most importantly despite the obvious anatomic divergence between the fly and humans the fundamental aspects of cell biology are highly conserved including the regulation of gene expression synaptogenesis cell proliferation cell differentiation cell signaling and cell death Many genes and pathways that are being studied in mammals were originally identified in Drosophila For instance the mammalian Wnt gene was originally identified as wingless in Drosophila with its mutation resulting in flies having no wings and Chopra Wnt wingless is now widely known for its involvement in a broad variety of conserved cellular processes and human diseases and Budnik The advantages of using Drosophila for studying human genes Comparing with mammals Drosophila has much simpler genetics The fruit fly has only four pairs of homologous chromosomes as compared to in mice and in humans Flies also have a much simpler nervous system with neurons in the fly brain comparing to billion neurons in humans Despite its simplicity the fly nervous system is comprehensive allowing the fly to perform a wide variety of behaviors such as feeding walking climbing courtship and communication Fruit flies are even capable of being trained with fear reward conditioning paradigms to examine complex biological processes like learning and memory These features of Drosophila make it an ideal organism for modeling complex disorders because it can be used to model a specific subset of phenotypes associated with a particular disease which will simplify the analysis A wide range of genetic manipulation techniques have been developed in Drosophila which are impractical to be implemented in mammals For instance the availability of P mutants in libraries is certainly an advantage that is exclusive to the Drosophila community Originally P are stretches of transposable DNA consisting of inverted repeats surrounding a transposase gene to allow hopping of the mobile element on chromosomes and Spradling O Hare and Rubin Drosophila researchers exploited its mobility and designed P without the transposase but with reporter genes By pairing up this modified P with an inducible transposase the P can then be randomly inserted into the genome to disrupt the transcription of downstream genes With this technique libraries of P for tenths of thousands of genes are constructed et al Bier et al Spradling et al Bellen et al Researchers can now conveniently access the information of these mutants from FlyBase http flybase org and order them from resource centers such as the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center In addition due to the nature that the mobilization of the P are typically imprecise these fly lines provide a means to generate excision mutants and Lastly the introduction of flipase recombination targets into P have provided the option of generating precise chromosomal deletions between two P and The development of these genetic tools have greatly enhanced the process of genome editing in Drosophila Another popular technique used in Drosophila research is the UAS binary transgene overexpression system which is perhaps one of the most versatile expression system ever developed in Drosophila and Perrimon is a yeast transcription factor that drives the expression of a transgene downstream of an Upstream Activation Sequence UAS Usually a fly line expresses under the control of a or promoter This can be achieved by screens or the fusion of identified promoters with the gene and subsequently microinjecting the constructs into fly embryos to produce specific driver lines For the operon a human disease gene of interest is usually subcloned into an expression construct containing UAS which is then also microinjected into fly embryos to produce transgenic fly lines The UAS operon lines will be crossed to fly lines resulting in the overexpression of the human disease gene of interest in the desired cells tissues If the expression of pathological human genes in the fly successfully yields an abnormal phenotype such as degeneration in the photoreceptor neurons of the fly eye genetic screens and pharmacological screens can then be performed to search for genetic modifiers and small molecules that may impact the etiology of the corresponding human disorders One of the most prominent aspects of the fly model is its capacity to conduct genetic screens to identify novel molecular components of pathological pathways Mice models of human diseases are absolutely vital to advancing our understanding of the diseases but nevertheless with limitations In Drosophila the classical forward genetic screens can be performed using mutagens such as ethyl methane sulfonate to generate mutants Johnston Yamamoto et al Since this approach is unbiased it allows the identification of novel genes from the entire genome which would otherwise be extremely difficult to perform in mouse models Due to having a short life cycle the simplicity of having only four pairs of homologous chromosomes and the availability of balancer chromosomes for the suppression of recombination the isolation of mutations from Drosophila is much easier than that from a mouse Apart from forward genetic screens tools for high throughput reverse genetic screens are also available Genetic tools for knockdown are easily accessible from stock centers such as the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center and Harvard Transgenic RNAi Project making it possible to conveniently perform reverse genetic screens in the fly model et al External features of Drosophila makes it suitable for performing large scale screens of genes and pharmacologicals Bristles wing veins and the compound eye are all external structures of the organism that can be affected by genetic or cellular changes and can easily be observed and scored under a stereomicroscope et al The compound eye is mostly composed of photoreceptor neurons and is commonly used as a model to monitor neurodegeneration allowing the identification of novel genetic modifiers and drugs in screens Johnston Using the UAS system toxic RNAs or toxic proteins that commonly occurs in human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases can be expressed in the fly eye which often results in a phenotype Since the eye is not required for viability this allows effective screening of genes or pharmacologicals that can alleviate or enhance the degeneration Most compounds can be simply mixed into standard Drosophila food to be consumed by larvae and adult flies Alternatively compounds can be injected into adult flies as well if a high acute dosage is needed in the adult stage The identification of novel genetic modifiers or drugs may reveal the physiological role of genes and promote our understanding of the disease pathology and Botas Hirth Pandey and Nichols McGurk et al Thus Drosophila serves as an important platform for the discoveries of new components of pathological pathways and the development of pioneer therapeutic approaches The limitations of modeling human diseases in the fruit fly Although the use of classical genetic screens of Drosophila provides an unbiased approach to gain insights into human degenerative diseases fly mutations may not be precise representations of human disease mutations This is because the classical fly mutants from forward genetic screens are typically alleles Yet in human diseases mutations can have complex presentations including both of the wild type allele and of the mutant allele Most of the times this effect can still be modeled in Drosophila by overexpressing the mutant protein using the UAS system Johnston But for some diseases which the of the wild type protein plays a major role in the disease etiology if there are no Drosophila orthologs of the corresponding human genes then perhaps the fly is not a suitable model for the particular disease Furthermore while the UAS system is an extremely effective and versatile system it is after all an overexpression system that may give rise to the typical caveats of overexpression studies The magnitude of overexpression in a model can be tremendously different from the clinical situation et al Sometimes even overexpressing a wild type version of a gene may cause a disease phenotype In fact excess protein in the Drosophila eye may lead to degeneration and Staveley Hence it is paramount for Drosophila researchers to set up appropriate controls to ensure that the phenotypes observed are not simply overexpression artifacts Lastly it is a concern of whether the fly models can faithfully recapitulate the selective neuronal death and associated phenotypes of human neurological disorders Although the Drosophila photoreceptor degeneration provides a convenient readout it mostly reflects generic neurotoxicity instead of selective neurotoxicity that is Thus it is important to verify relevant phenotypes using other systems that are more specific to the particular types of disease For instance for myotonic dystrophy it is crucial to verify any degeneration phenotype in a neuromuscular system like the Drosophila or mouse neuromuscular junction Haro et al Panaite et al Despite all the limitations Drosophila has so far proven to be a valid and useful tool in unraveling the etiology of human diseases and identifying compounds that can improve symptoms and modify the course of human diseases Success examples include the rescuing of phenotypes in fly models of fragile X syndrome et al prolonged survival of dopaminergic neurons in fly models of Parkinson s disease et al Faust et al and lifespan extension in fly models of Alzheimer s disease et al Repeat neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases As early as unstable nucleotide repeat expansion had already been identified as a mutational mechanism underlying several human disease Originally only trinucleotide repeats were associated with human diseases et al La Spada et al But over the years other expandable microsatellite repeats were gradually discovered including unstable and repeats Remarkably the majority of the repeat diseases manifest with neurological and neuromuscular symptoms Until today more than neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders have been linked with unstable nucleotide repeat expansions in the human genome et al Brouwer et al Todd and Paulson Polak et al Repeat expansions can be coding or and the underlying mechanism of a READ may involve of protein of toxic RNAs or of toxic proteins Coding expansion disorders usually result from smaller repeat copies to tens of that manifest in exon coding regions of genes This group of READs includes mostly polyglutamine diseases like Huntington s disease and several forms of spinocerebellar ataxia which typically involves the translation of the gene products together with the repeat expansions into toxic proteins with Spada et al MacDonald et al Orr et al Kawaguchi et al Imbert et al Pulst et al Sanpei et al David et al Zhuchenko et al Nakamura et al In contrast the expansions disorders typically involve larger expansions to which reside in the regions of genes such as promoters introns or untranslated regions This groups includes fragile tremor ataxia syndrome Friedrich s ataxia FTD myotonic dystrophy types and and and et al Montermini et al Jin et al Mutsuddi et al et al Renton et al expansions usually results in transcripts with RNA toxicity However even expansions can still be translated into toxic peptides by translation et al Thus the pathologies of READs are complex as both coding and repeat expansions may involve a combination of mechanisms including proteins toxic RNA and toxic protein Figure Classification of READs and their types of toxicity READs can be classified into coding and A repeat expansion that occur in the coding region of an affected gene may result in the of the wild type proteins the of toxic RNAs and the of toxic proteins In contrast a repeat expansion in the region of an affected gene would not lead to immediate protein toxicity but could involve the of the wild type proteins and the of toxic RNAs However RAN translation may still occur in READs which results in the production of toxic proteins peptides RNA toxicty in reads and its pathogenic mechanisms The concept that RNA itself acts as a major toxic species in neurodegenerative neuromuscular disorders was first described for is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase DMPK gene et al Fu et al Mahadevan et al Ribonuclear foci were found to be forming in the nuclei of the affected cells and these foci contain the RNA transcripts from the CTG repeat expansion et al In brief the expanded repeats localized at the foci in turn sequester endogenous RNA binding proteins impairing the alternatively splicing mechanisms and leading to cellular toxicity and degeneration Renoux and Todd Belzil et al Fiszer and Krzyzosiak Nalavade et al This is the or splicing impairment model which is one of the most supported mechanisms of the emerging toxicity model The ribonuclear foci are now a hallmark for most of the READs associated with repeats and Krzyzosiak Some even coined the term for these disorders due to the clear involvement of RNA toxicity Noted that despite the consensus that the formation of foci is a feature of pathogenesis their role in pathogenesis is still unclear The original belief was that they could be toxic since they harbor the toxic RNA transcripts Yet accumulating evidence from and FTD studies now suggests that the foci per se do not appear to be toxic since cells with foci do not necessarily degenerate et al Yu et al Mizielinska et al Tran et al The fact that cells with the same amount of foci could very well be alive or dying indicating that toxicity is not proportional to foci numbers et al Tran et al Thus ribonuclear foci could be neutral or even beneficial at least in the beginning phase of the disease progression Figure Possible mechanisms of RNA toxicity in repeat diseases Repeat expansion can occur in coding or regions of affected genes Bidirectional transcription results in both sense and antisense transcripts containing the repeats Both sense and antisense expanded RNAs can form ribonuclear foci The foci may sequester proteins such as in the case of leading to impairment of the alternative splicing and nucleocytoplasmic transport machineries The sense and antisense ssRNAs can anneal to form dsRNAs ssRNAs can also form hairpin structures by themselves which are degradation resistant Both dsRNAs and RNAs may export the nucleus and be cleaved into sRNAs by Dicer The sRNAs can then sequester proteins leading to splicing and nucleocytoplasmic transport impairment For hexanucleotide repeats such as GGGCC in FTD the ssRNA may form structures These structures facilitate DNA RNA hybrid and impede transcription They also form inclusions leading to the sequestration of proteins as well transcripts whether in hairpin or structures can bind to NCL inducing nucleolar stress and caspase activation Expanded transcripts that escape the nucleus associate themselves with ribosomes leading to RAN translation RAN translational products may form inclusions which disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport impedes the ubiquitin protease system and impairs the assembly dynamics and functions of organelles such as the nucleolar and stress granules In neurons the expanded transcripts may also be actively transported to neurites resulting in neuritic branching and transport granule defects It is postulated that the local translational machinery may also be disrupted An alternative mechanism of RNA toxicity is bidirectional transcription The original discovery for bidirectional transcription came from a study on is a type of spinocerebellar ataxia arises from a CTG expansion in the end of a coding RNA Opposite Strand Koob et al Its pathogenic mechanism was thought to be similar to since both disorders involves a CTG repeat However the antisense transcript has a short cryptic open reading frame that results in CAG repeats in the glutamine reading frame et al Moreover nuclear polyQ inclusions were found indicating that both toxic RNA and toxic proteins were being produced and could be involved in the pathogenesis of et al Bidirectional transcription was found in models of FXTAS and suggesting that it is a common mechanism of RNA toxicity in READs et al Ladd et al Sopher et al A third mechanism of RNA toxicity is nucleolar stress and nucleocytoplasmic transport defects Nucleolar stress is defined as the cellular pathways used by the nucleolus to communicate with cytosolic compartments in order to trigger apoptosis et al Lindenboim et al Hence nucleolar stress is a conserved and effective mechanism to eliminate ribosome cells It has been reported that CAG repeat expansion in polyglutamine diseases interacts directly with nucleolin a nucleolar protein that regulates rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis et al The CAG impairment of ribosome biogenesis in turn increases the concentration of in mitochondria disrupts the interaction between and factors such as and Bak causes cytochrome c release and caspase activation and eventually leads to cell death et al In polyQ diseases the fact that CAG RNAs are retained in the nucleus indicates defective nucleocytoplasmic transport of the mutant transcripts et al It was reported that CAG repeats can directly bind to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor the fly homolog of human that is involved in the nuclear export of mRNA is capable of forming a complex with the nuclear export receptor to regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNAs et al Thus the downregulation of due to sequestration by CAG repeats results in the nuclear accumulation of RNAs et al Furthermore the researchers observed a neurodevelopmental downregulation of protein levels in a mouse model of HD suggesting that the reduction in levels causes nuclear accumulation of expanded transcripts in HD Apart from polyQ diseases nucleocytoplasmic transport defects have also been demonstrated in models of FTD et al Zhang et al These studies demonstrate the involvement of the nucleolar stress and nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in the RNA pathogenesis of READs A forth mechanism of RNA toxicity is mediated by single stranded RNAs and RNAs containing the expanded repeats Both of them would eventually lead to the generating of toxic small RNAs which is the true culprit of this mechanism of RNA toxicity in READs It is known that hairpin structures can be formed by single stranded CAG repeats in polyQ diseases and CGG repeats in FXTAS et al Complex secondary structures like hairpin loops can significantly alter the transcripts processing transport translation and interactions with RNA binding proteins Hairpin structures also strongly protects the RNAs from attacks by nucleases rendering them more resistant to degradation et al Hence the hairpin structure itself already conveys a type of toxicity However the more severe consequences come from the fact that it facilitates the production of sRNAs via the RNAi machinery Dicer is an RNase III family ribonuclease that cleaves precursor RNAs to generate sRNAs and is a key enzyme involved in RNAi et al Since expanded ssRNAs in READs form hairpin structures they are valid substrates of Dicer and will be cleaved into sRNAs Even though these sRNAs cannot form ribonuclear foci they are still capable of binding to key proteins of the alternative splicing machinery such as and cause defects in RNA processing et al sRNAs with as few as seven CAG repeats have been shown to induce caspase activation and cellular toxicity in a disease model of HD et al It has been reported that the knockdown of Dicer expression can reduce sRNA in HD and models supporting the involvement of RNAi in the toxicity of READs et al et al Since bidirectional transcription is common with repeat expansions the transcribed sense and antisense strands may form RNAs Once again dsRNA is a substrate of Dicer thus it becomes a source of sRNAs This mechanism was demonstrated in two Drosophila studies One showed that that dsRNAs comprising CAG CUG repeats can be a source of cellular toxicity via the Dicer pathway et al The other study showed that the of CAG and CUG repeats results in enhanced RNA toxicity in a manner by generating more sRNAs which impedes the expression of genes such as and protein TBP Yu et al Therefore both ssRNA hairpins and dsRNAs can be a source of harmful sRNAs that results in cellular toxicity For hexanucleotide repeat expansions such as GGGGCC in FTD the single stranded RNA repeats can even form structures et al Haeusler et al structures can induce a number of detrimental consequences in the cell including transcription impairment formation of inclusions and sequestration of ribonucleoproteins to impeded alternative splicing and induce nucleolar stress et al Conlon et al A fifth mechanism which expanded transcripts lead to cellular toxicity is by translation Normally protein synthesis is initiated by the start codon ATG which leads to the translation of mRNA Ranum and colleagues have discovered a novel mechanism which repeat expansions in READs can bypass the need of a start codon and mediate RAN translation of the transcripts et al In RAN translation the accumulated expanded repeat RNA may undergo protein translation in all three possible reading frames resulting in the production of proteins consisting of different amino acid combinations et al It has been shown in FXTAS and FTD that the protein products from RAN translation are highly toxic and play an significant role in pathogenesis et al Todd et al Mizielinska et al Freibaum et al Oh et al Tran et al Lee et al A sixth mechanism of RNA toxicity involves the expanded RNAs being actively transported to neurites by transport granules which in turn induces a neuritic branching defect in neurons et al This could be explained by the fact that the expanded transport granules cannot function normally and the transport defects possibly interfere with the local translational machinery as well et al Modeling the RNA toxicity of repeat expansions in Drosophila Recent work in Drosophila has begun to shed light on the emerging toxicity model One of the earliest Drosophila studies that demonstrated this model was pioneered by Rebay and colleagues in the pathogenesis of et al Unlike most other types of SCA is associated with a CTG repeat expansion within a region et al A Drosophila model of was developed by overexpressing the transcript of the human locus in the fly eye which results in retinal degeneration et al The Drosophila RNA binding protein genes staufen muscleblind split ends and were all subsequently identified as genetic modifiers of this degeneration suggesting that RNA rather than expanded protein is the source of toxicity et al is another READ demonstrated to be caused by RNA toxicity is associated with a CUG repeat expansion in the UTR of the DMPK gene A Drosophila model of was established by expressing CUG repeats in either the Drosophila eyes or muscles Degeneration was observed in both cases indicating the presence of toxic RNA Haro et al In the case of FXTAS a CGG repeat expansion occurs in the UTR of the gene In Drosophila it was reported that the expression of CGG repeats was sufficient to induce retinal degeneration in the absence of expressed proteins et al All these studies in Drosophila support the notion that RNA toxicity play a significant role in the pathologies of many READs More importantly these studies also demonstrate the fruit fly as an excellent model for studying human READs and RNA toxicity Currently fly models have been established for at least different READs Below we will cover a number of READs with RNA toxicity and highlight the discoveries made using their corresponding Drosophila models These READs were selected base on the following two criteria It has been shown that RNA toxicity contributes to the pathology of these diseases and there are established Drosophila models for studying the RNA toxicity of these diseases Table Published transgenic Drosophila lines for modeling

Drosophila models of polyglutamine diseases Polyglutamine diseases are caused by the expansion of unstable CAG repeats in the region of the respective disease gene The CAG repeats are translated into a string of glutamine in normal functioning proteins Patients of polyQ diseases often develop progressive neurodegeneration and motor impairment et al PolyQ diseases include HD spinobulbar muscular atrophy a k a Kennedy atrophy spinocerebellar ataxia types k a disease or and Spada et al MacDonald et al Orr et al Kawaguchi et al Imbert et al Pulst et al Sanpei et al David et al Zhuchenko et al Nakamura et al Warrick et al HD is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in exon of the Huntingtin HTT gene et al For SBMA the CAG repeat expansion lies in the of the coding region of the androgen receptor gene Spada et al Zhou et al For DRPLA the unstable CAG expansion occurs in the middle of the gene et al As for and the CAG expansion are located in the coding regions of and protein TBP respectively et al Rub et al Despite the fact that the CAG repeat expansions in these polyQ diseases affect different genes there are several shared features among the majority of polyQ diseases First a common hallmark is the abnormal aggregation of nuclear inclusions containing the mutant proteins These inclusions that contain abnormal aggregated proteins were once regarded as a potential cause of cellular toxicity However a number of studies have demonstrated that the formation of inclusions could actually be a cellular protective response to mitigate the toxicity et al Petrucelli et al Arrasate et al Until today the general belief is that the formation of aggregates is a dynamic process Smaller oligomeric inclusions are likely to toxic whereas the large aggregates might actually be protective and Poirier Further investigations will be required to elucidate their true nature Second the CAG repeat length is inversely proportional to the age of disease onset Longer CAG lengths cause earlier onset of polyQ diseases and Orr Ross and Poirier This is because once the polyQ repeat length exceeds a pathogenic threshold the mutant proteins are likely to into abnormal conformations that can resist normal cellular degradation machineries such as the system Chan et al Ross and Poirier PolyQ diseases were among the first neurodegenerative diseases modeled in Drosophila The earliest Drosophila models include HD and Zipursky and colleagues fused a truncated form of human HTT with a polyQ tract of or repeats HTT and HTT Jackson et al whereas Bonini and colleagues generated truncated forms of human with a polyQ tract of or repeats and et al When expressed in the fly eye both studies found that only the constructs with pathogenic lengths HTT and induced nuclear inclusions and degeneration recapitulating the pathogenic features of polyQ diseases These studies for the first time demonstrated that D melanogaster can be a powerful model to study human neurodegenerative diseases Subsequently more Drosophila models of HD and et al Lee et al Warrick et al Kaltenbach et al Li et al Romero et al Doumanis et al Weiss et al as well as other polyQ diseases including et al et al et al Latouche et al et al SBMA et al Pandey et al Nedelsky et al and DRPLA et al Napoletano et al were developed All these studies demonstrate that polyQ diseases in most cases can yield parallel neural degenerative effects in the fruit fly Besides protein toxicity there is now substantial evidence for RNA toxicity in polyQ diseases as well One of the most compelling studies was performed by Bonini and colleagues in the studying of in Drosophila et al which they showed that the expression of both translated and untranslated CAG repeats caused neural degeneration whereas the expression of CAG repeats resulted in significantly less pronounced neurodegenerative effects et al Similar to CAG repeats CAA repeats also encode for glutamine Yet CAA repeats are unable to form a hairpin structure et al As the hairpin structure contributes to CAG sRNA generation it is one of the major mechanisms of RNA toxicity et al et al Therefore the above findings suggest that RNA toxicity contributes significantly to neurodegeneration in Apart from hairpin structures it is also known that CAG repeats in polyQ diseases similar to CUG repeats in can form ribonuclear foci that colocalize with proteins such as and cause misregulation in alternative splicing et al Yuan et al Hsu et al Mykowska et al Wang et al In fact Krzyzosiak and colleagues demonstrated that expanded CAG repeats present in HTT and transcripts colocalize with in ribonuclear foci further confirming the accumulation of mutant RNA in the nucleus et al Interestingly although both CAG and CUG repeats form foci sequester and affect alternative splicing the splicing of some are only affected by CUG repeats but not CAG repeats et al Hence despite the overlapping mechanisms of involvement of there are still differences in how splicing is disrupted by CAG repeats in polyQ diseases and CUG repeats in In addition to the sequestering of proteins RNA toxicity in polyQ diseases may also arise from the perturbation of RNA export mechanisms and the induction of nucleolar stress et al In the Drosophila model of it has been demonstrated that which is involved in the nuclear export of mRNA can bind directly to CAG repeats and form a complex with the nuclear export receptor et al and the downregulation of correlates with the nuclear accumulation of expanded CAG RNA et al Apart from CAG repeat expansion can also interact directly with NCL and induce apoptosis by the activation of the nucleolar stress pathway et al NCL is an essential protein involved in RNA polymerase rRNA transcription in the nucleolus The binding of expanded CAG repeats perturbs ribosome biogenesis which in turn increases the levels of mitochondrial and causes cytochrome c release and caspase activation et al Utilizing the established fly models of much advances have been made in the search of genetic modifiers of polyQ toxicity and RNA toxicity Using the fly model of was found to colocalize with polyQ inclusion bodies and was identified as a strong suppressor of polyQ toxicity et al Chan et al A genetic screen was also performed and identified a number of other chaperones and ubiquitin molecules as genetic modifiers of polyQ toxicity and Bonini As for RNA toxicity in a microarray analysis was performed to search for genes which expression levels are affected by CAG repeats and Bonini Several iron ion binding and nucleotide binding molecules were found to be affected Interestingly the transcriptional regulator Dpld and the protein were able to modify both polyQ and RNA toxicity suggesting that there are overlapping mechanisms of RNA and protein based toxicity and Bonini All the above studies demonstrated that both protein and RNA toxicity contribute to neurodegeneration in polyQ diseases and both types of toxicity can involve a number of different underlying molecular mechanisms which can be studied using Drosophila models Drosophila models of fragile X syndrome and fragile tremor ataxia syndrome Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability often associated with autism spectrum disorders et al Santoro et al The disease was first described as mental retardation segregated in fashion and Bell The chromosomal variation was later mapped to and was dubbed fragile X et al In FXS a trinucleotide CGG expansion in the UTR of the gene results in transcriptional silencing and loss of the corresponding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Fu et al Kremer et al Normal alleles contain repeats premutation alleles contain and the disease alleles contain over repeats FMRP is an protein which negatively regulates the translation of mRNAs especially at synapses in neurons Loss of FMRP impairs synaptic plasticity which is believed to be the molecular basis for the intellectual disability in FXS patients and Warren The Drosophila genome contains a gene et al The first Drosophila FXS model was generated by imprecise excision of a P located upstream of the locus to produce a null mutant et al Subsequently a wide array of alleles and transgenes have been created to facilitate FXS research in this classic genetic model et al Morales et al Lee et al Overexpression of either the human FMRP or the native Drosophila dFMRP fully rescues all detectable phenotypes in the Drosophila FXS model et al confirming the evolutionary conserved functions of in the nervous system In Warren and colleagues expressed CGG repeats with a reporter in the Drosophila compound eye and demonstrated retinal degeneration in the absence of expressed proteins et al These findings suggest that apart from of FMRP there exists a toxic RNA component associated with the repeat expansion that occurs at the UTR of the gene This RNA toxicity causes a neural degeneration phenotype which is now identified as Fragile tremor ataxia syndrome While FXS is mostly caused by the of FMRP which results in neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders characterized by mental retardation autism anxiety and mood instability FXTAS is mostly caused by the CGG repeat expansion that produces RNA toxicity in the CNS which results in a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive intention tremor gait ataxia parkinsonism and cognitive decline et al Tassone and Hagerman FXTAS is found mostly in male premutation carriers after the age of and Hagerman Although at a much lower rate female carriers may also develop FXTAS The neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is the intranuclear inclusion present in both neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain et al Warren and colleagues found that in their fly model of FXTAS the inclusion bodies in the degenerating neurons contain et al Furthermore when they overexpress the CGG degeneration was suppressed et al which is similar to the case of where also presents suppressor activity of CAG toxicity et al Chan et al Two subsequent studies have utilized this Drosophila model of FXTAS and identified a number of tropomyosin and proteins as genetic modifiers of the degeneration phenotype et al Sofola et al These findings strongly suggest that the RNA processing machinery play an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS Interestingly both studies have found that one of these proteins that interacts with the CGG repeats to be protein which is a protein also involved in the pathogenesis of another READ Indeed CGG repeats have been shown to form RNA hairpin structures in vitro similar to CAG repeats in and CUG repeats in et al Thus it is possible that these proteins bind to the CGG repeats in an effort to disassemble these potentially toxic hairpins but in the process neglected their other cellular functions Recent studies in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases have advanced toward the investigation of cellular transcriptional and translational profiles Nelson and colleagues discovered that mice Purkinje neurons ectopically expressing CGG repeats exhibit a dramatic change in their translational profile even prior to the onset of CGG phenotypes et al Interestingly the Tardbp gene which encodes the protein was found to be reduced in Purkinje neurons et al is a protein commonly found in the inclusion bodies in ALS and Yang In the fly model of FXTAS overexpression of suppresses neurodegeneration in the fly eye whereas knockdown of Drosophila results in enhancement of the degeneration phenotype et al Todd and colleagues also discovered that overexpression of was capable of suppressing CGG repeat toxicity et al Interestingly they found that the CGG repeat RNA levels and RAN translation levels are both not affected by Instead they found alters the composition behavior and distribution of multimeric protein complexes preventing the sequestration of hnRNP and rescuing the alternative splicing machinery et al They also tested an ALS mutant form of which can still bind to hnRNP and yet it failed to rescue the CGG repeat toxicity suggesting that wild type functions are necessary for this suppression of CGG repeat toxicity et al In the study above by Nelson and colleagues the researchers discovered transcripts that are differentially associated with ribosomes in the CGG Purkinje neurons et al Theoretically if ribosomes are recruited to the repeat expansions translation of the repeats would be facilitated Indeed RAN translation has also been demonstrated in FXTAS models Paulson and colleagues have demonstrated that CGG repeats lead to RAN translation of a cryptic protein FMRpolyG which is present in inclusion bodies in FXTAS fly models mouse models and FXTAS patient brains et al The researchers constructed a Drosophila line expressing CGG repeats preceded by a stop codon just to the repeats Production of FMRpolyG is inhibited by this stop codon but the CGG RNA remained This line gave rise to a much milder phenotype comparing with CGG repeats without the stop codon indicating RAN translated FMRpolyG contribute to toxicity et al A Drosophila study revealed that FMRpolyG impairs the ubiquitin protease system et al Inhibition of RAN translation can reduce inclusion formation and attenuate the impairment of the ubiquitin protease system et al Taken together these studies suggest that FXTAS pathogenesis may be mechanistically related to the polyQ diseases myotonic dystrophy and ALS Thus different READs that arise from different causes may converge and share some common molecular mechanisms in their pathogenesis Drosophila models of myotonic dystrophy type and type Myotonic dystrophy is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting about in adults It is a multisystemic autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive myotonia of muscles to relax after muscle degeneration iridescent cataracts cardiac arrhythmias testicular atrophy and symptoms of neuropathology is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the UTR of the DMPK gene which encodes a protein kinase et al Normal individuals typically have fewer than CTG repeats whereas patients can range from to repeats et al The mutant transcripts containing CUG repeats fold into RNA hairpins that are retained in the nucleus et al Koch and Leffert whereas the levels of DMPK protein are correspondingly reduced et al Dmpk knockout mice have reduced force generation in skeletal muscles et al and abnormal cardiac conduction et al which suggests that the loss of DMPK function may contribute to at least the muscle weakness and cardiac defects in However Dmpk knockout mice do not display myotonia and muscle degeneration et al which are some of the hallmark features of In contrast transgenic mice expressing expanded CTG repeats display myotonia degeneration and several other muscular pathological abnormalities et al These results demonstrated that the expanded CTG repeats by themselves could account for at least some of the major pathological features of independent of the DMPK locus It was eventually demonstrated that the transcripts retained in the nucleus aggregate into ribonuclear foci et al Mankodi et al These foci binds to proteins like and et al Kanadia et al which in turn compromises the RNA splicing machinery et al Ho et al and even disrupts the regulation of transcription et al Monckton and colleagues developed a Drosophila model of by fusing CTG repeats to a reporter gene and overexpressing the repeats in fly muscles et al Although CUG repeats results in the formation of ribonuclear foci it did not result in detectable cellular toxicity Botas and colleagues further examined the effect of CUG repeats by increasing the repeat number to With this amount of repeats vacuolization and degeneration were then detected in adult fly muscles Haro et al Expression of CUG repeats in the adult eye also results in disorganization of ommatidia and reduction of the eye size suggesting RNA toxicity Haro et al et al Similar to mammals the molecular mechanisms of this toxicity involve the sequestration of Drosophila Mbl and by the CUG ribonuclear foci resulting in defective alternative splicing Haro et al et al However in contrast to which has been shown to interact with CGG repeats and is involved in FXTAS no evidence for the genetic interaction of muscleblind family proteins and CGG repeats had been found in Drosophila et al Thus although the pathogenesis of FXTAS and myotonic dystrophy may share some commonalities there are certainly distinct mechanisms for the two READs as well Utilizing this fly model of Botas and colleagues identified SMAUG a protein as suppressor of CUG toxicity Haro et al SMAUG interacts genetically and physically with and its overexpression restores the translational activity of in this model Haro et al Refinements of the fly models were made in some recent studies with new discoveries being yield Jagla and colleagues constructed fly lines with and interrupted CTG repeats and established a novel Drosophila larval model of et al Using this model they constructed transcription profiles of and uncovers a number of deregulated genes et al Bonini and colleagues cloned and uninterrupted pure CTG repeats into the UTR of the DsRed gene to better recapitulate the pathological condition of the disease et al Repeat toxicity was detected when the repeat length reaches or more Interestingly the researchers discovered that there was a synergistic effect on the enhancement of toxicity when CAG repeats are together with CUG repeats due to the biogenesis of sRNAs et al This enhancement was indicating the involvement of the RNAi machinery et al is caused by a tetranucleotide CCTG repeat expansion in the first intron of the zinc finger protein gene which encodes a protein et al Affected individuals can have to CCTG repeats with a mean of et al much like involves the aggregation of expanded mutant transcripts into ribonuclear foci which interfere with key molecules of the splicing machinery such as and et al Although and share much similarities in their pathologies has neurological involvement and cannot be congenital et al To develop a fly model of Bonini and colleagues generated constructs with and CCTG repeats to investigate RNA toxicity et al Expression of repeats was sufficient to induce the formation of ribonuclear foci but impairment of alternative splicing and retinal degeneration were only observed when the repeat length was or above In addition the researchers demonstrate that the expression of two different isoforms of or without the linker region between zinc finger domain and can lead to cleavage of CUG or CCUG RNA repeats and mildly rescue degeneration in the fly eye et al Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis frontotemporal dementia Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known as Lou Gehrig s disease is an neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the cortex brainstem and spinal cord Symptoms include the loss of movement control difficulty in speaking swallowing and eventually breathing which leads to fatality ALS affects about per individuals in Europe and the United States et al Most cases of ALS are deemed sporadic but cases are inherited and Rouleau Mutations from more than different genes have been linked to familial ALS et al and Siddique Despite some of these identified genes play a role in RNA metabolism and axonal trafficking Ikenaka et al Millecamps and Julien Droppelmann et al most of them apparently do not function in the same molecular pathway complicating the underlying mechanisms of the disease et al and Siddique In the expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the region of was found to be associated with ALS combined with frontotemporal dementia et al Renton et al Frontotemporal dementia is a group of disorders caused by the progressive loss of neurons predominantly at the frontal and or temporal lobes of the brain resulting in cognitive and behavioral impairment and is one of the most common causes of dementia second only to Alzheimer s disease et al Perry and Miller and Jankovic Remarkably over of sporadic ALS FTD cases and over familial ALS FTD cases are caused by the expansion of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the first intron of the gene et al Jin and colleagues pioneered the first Drosophila model of FTD by expressing GGGGCC repeats with a reporter in the compound eye which resulted in severe retinal degeneration et al When was expressed in motor neurons it resulted in defective locomotor whereas when it was expressed in the central nervous system using a driver it resulted in lethality et al One important question to be answered was how GGGGCC repeats actually cause the disease The pathogenesis could be due to of protein of toxic RNA consisting of the GGGGCC repeats and or of toxic dipeptide repeat proteins generated by RAN translation Although the mild phenotypes in a homozygous mutation case and the lack of coding mutations suggest that protein is unlikely the primary cause of FTD et al Harms et al of the wild type protein is still a possible mechanism that contribute to the disease pathogenesis Since Drosophila does not have an ortholog of the fly may not be a suitable model organism for investigating the haploinsufficiency aspect of The fly however proved a valuable tool in determining the toxicity of GGGGCC repeats in FTD In the attempt to differentiate between repeat RNA and DPR protein toxicity Isaacs and colleagues generated stop repeats of GGGGCC and compared it with pure GGGGCC repeats which can be into DPR proteins in Drosophila et al Isaacs and colleagues found that the expression of RO or pure results in the same amount of ribonuclear foci formation However the expression of all RO constructs including RO RO and even RO had no detectable effect on the fly eye In contrast both pure and pure caused degeneration These findings suggest that although both RNA and DPR proteins may contribute to toxicity degeneration was primarily attributable to DPR proteins et al To further investigate whether DPR protein expression alone was sufficient to cause degeneration they generated four constructs by using alternative codons When expressed in the fly eye only and constructs resulted in degeneration whereas and had no detectable effect Even at the repeat length of same results were obtained for the above DPR proteins indicating that high DPR protein is the major cause of neurodegeneration in FTD et al To determine the molecular mechanism that underlies DPR degeneration Taylor Gao and colleagues generated flies and performed a screen to look for genetic modifiers of eye degeneration et al Eighteen modifier genes were identified with the majority of them being transcription export complex proteins and nuclear pore complex proteins involving particularly nuclear export of RNA Lastly Taylor Gao and colleagues predicted that can produce or DPR proteins by RAN translation Consistent with an aforementioned study they found that the to be highly toxic et al In summary the researchers demonstrated that GGGGCC repeat expansion compromises nucleocytoplasmic transport facilitating nuclear retention of toxic RNAs Whereas the of toxic DPR proteins by RAN translation is a major cause of neurodegeneration Rothstein and colleagues also conducted a screen to search for interactors for GGGGCC RNA and uncovered RanGAP as a potent suppressor of neurodegeneration et al RanGAP is a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport supporting that the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms are involved in the neurodegeneration in FTD et al In the same year another screen performed in yeast by Gitler and colleagues identified effectors of nucleocytoplasmic transport and karyopherins as modifiers of DPR protein toxicity et al A recent study by Van Den Bosch and colleagues also reported the results of a Drosophila genetic screen which identified importins exportins cycle regulators nuclear pore components and arginine methylases as potent modifiers of DPR protein toxicity et al Taking a different approach Taylor and colleagues analyzed the interactome of all DPR proteins in human cells and found that DPR proteins and interact with proteins with low complexity sequence domains such as FUS and et al Using the Drosophila eye they confirmed that these proteins are genetic modifiers of DPR toxicity Remarkably most of these genetic modifiers encode components of organelles including the nucleoli the nuclear pore complexes and stress granules The researchers showed that GR and PR bind to the proteins alter their biophysical properties and lead to impairment of their assembly dynamics and functions et al A consensus from all these studies was that the DPR proteins that cause toxicity in FTD contain arginine Arginine is a unique amino acid that has as many as five potential donors that are readily available to react with biological acceptors In complexes arginine residues are the most frequent hydrogen bond donors to backbone phosphate groups et al Networks of hydrogen bonds can be formed by arginine residues with phosphate groups of RNA loops as well et al Whereas among the interactions between amino acids the double interaction is also an extremely stable structure et al Each methylation of an arginine residue removes a potential donor and changes the shape of the amino acid Thus methylation can reduce the chance of arginine bonding to its interactors which in turn increases the chance of an DPR protein to be degraded This is supported by the finding that arginine methylases are potent modifiers of DPR protein toxicity et al DPR proteins have been proven toxic in a number of studies by various groups But the question remained whether the nuclear GGGGCC RNA induces toxicity The study above by Isaacs and colleagues did not detect any significant degeneration when as many as repeats were expressed in the fly eye et al Gao and colleagues further explored this important question and tested the effects of a Drosophila model expressing a minigene with GGGGCC repeats Tran et al The in this model is flanked by human intronic and exonic sequences of Intriguingly even though the spliced intronic formed abundant nuclear GGGGCC sense RNA foci they gave rise to no detectable neurodevelopmental defects Cells were also normal in their rRNA biogenesis and mRNA processing et al When flies were reared at instead of the normal a modest level of toxicity was detected But since the higher temperature induced more DPR proteins while the number of RNA foci did not change it is likely that this toxicity was due to the increased DPR proteins instead of the RNA foci et al Summarizing the above studies the GGGGCC repeat expansion in FTD share much commonalities with other READs such as the formation of foci sequestration of proteins and induction of nucleolar stress Yet unlike most other READs described here the RNA transcripts containing the GGGGCC repeat expansions and the foci in FTD do not appear to be the main source of toxicity Rather it is the DPR proteins produced by RAN translation can still arguably be called a type of RNA that are the major determinants of toxicity and degeneration in this disease Nevertheless just when everyone thought GGGGCC RNA does not give rise to any kind of toxicity Bonini and colleagues discovered a new form of GGGGCC RNA toxicity that may be independent of DPR proteins In cultured mice spinal cord neurons GGGGCC and CAG repeat RNAs were found to localize to transport granules that travel to distal neuritic segments et al Expression of the GGGGCC RNA gave rise to neuritic branching defects Using a Drosophila model the researchers found that this branching defects can be enhanced by the upregulation or suppressed by the downregulation of or et al The researchers speculated that the presence of GGGGCC repeat RNA in neurites might result in local RAN translation of toxic DPR proteins However they were unable to detect RAN peptides in their study et al These findings demonstrate that GGGGCC expanded repeat RNAs can cause transport granule dysfunction which could be a novel RNA toxicity mechanism independent of DPR proteins contributing to the neuronal defects in FTD It is important to note that hexanucleotide repeats such as GGGGCC are capable of forming distinct structures called DNA and RNA et al Haeusler et al These structures facilitate DNA RNA hybrids impedes transcription and binds to ribonucleoproteins such as NCL inducing nucleolar stress et al They also form inclusions and sequester hnRNP H which impedes alternative splicing et al The real impacts of these structures on the pathogenesis of FTD are only just beginning to be elucidated Therapeutic development to combat RNA toxicity in reads Much progress has been made in the past decade regarding potential therapeutic strategies against the RNA toxicity in READs The current three main streams of therapeutics are therapeutics therapeutics and small therapeutics In therapeutics have been demonstrated to disrupt foci formation and reduce RNA toxicity in both and FTD et al Wheeler et al Donnelly et al et al Sareen et al Riboldi et al et al therapeutics have shown some promising results in mitigating RNA toxicity in models by reducing the interaction between CUG repeats and and decreasing foci formation et al et al Rzuczek et al It has also been reported that a peptide can bind to CAG repeats and suppress nucleolar stress and neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model of et al Last but not least designs in small molecules designs have achieved much successes in combating and FTD as well drugs like ketoprofen histamine receptor inhibitors like orphenadrine and sodium calcium metabolism modifiers like clenbuterol and spironolactone have been shown in Drosophila models of to mitigate the effects of CUG toxicity et al Pentamidine and neomycin B have been shown to disrupt binding to CUG repeats et al A number of small molecules including bisamidinium inhibitors can target toxic interactions and alleviate the sequestration of by repeat expansions et al Kumar et al Parkesh et al Wong et al Luu et al Porphyrins that distorts RNA structures can ablate the GGGGCC repeat expansion s interaction with or ASF et al There are small molecules that can even reduce DPR protein production in a model of FTD et al Histone deacetylase inhibitors like sodium butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid had been shown to suppress degeneration in a Drosophila model of HD et al Although this suppression may involve protein toxicity instead of RNA toxicity Furthermore in a Drosophila model of SBMA and a Drosophila model of FXTAS overexpression of the HDACs themselves actually suppressed the degeneration phenotypes et al Todd et al Thus the effects of HDACs inhibitors could be different for different types of READs The newest trend in the designing of small molecules is driving toward compounds with multiple modes of actions in combating the pathogenesis of the disease Zimmerman and colleagues have reported a type of small molecule can target pathology by acting as transcription inhibitors by inhibiting aberrant protein binding to toxic RNA and by acting as RNase mimics to degrade the toxic RNA et al Gitler and colleagues discovered that the transcription elongation factor selectively decreased both sense and antisense GGGGCC expanded transcripts and partially rescued retinal degeneration in the fly eye model of FTD et al Knockdown of the human ortholog of decreased sense and antisense RNA foci and DPR protein production in FTD cells et al The study demonstrated as a new potential therapeutic target since the disruption of can ameliorate degeneration induced by different modes of toxicity sources Animal models such as the fly models described in this review are valuable tools in the testing of novel compounds and therapeutic targets before clinical trials They will also continue to serve as important platforms for the discoveries of unknown mechanisms of diseases that may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches Concluding remarks In this review we highlighted Drosophila as an excellent model organism for the studying of READs The studies mentioned above have revealed comprehensive information regarding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in READs demonstrating the elegant use of the fly models in pioneering discoveries of RNA toxicity Despite the fact that protein toxicity is a major factor that contributes to the pathogenesis of many READs we are now certain that RNA toxicity also plays a major role in inducing neural and muscle degeneration via a number of possible ways including but not limited to the impairment of alternative splicing the promotion of bidirectional transcription the induction of nucleolar stress and disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport the generation of sRNA from hairpins and dsRNA and RAN translation of peptides Although the formation of visible ribonuclear foci is still a hallmark of pathogenesis more and more evidence is indicating that the initial emergence of foci does not equal to immediate detectable toxicity The foci do not initiate the disease process per se In fact the formation of foci could possibly be a healthy response to temporarily sequester the toxic RNA Although in the long run foci may still contribute to the progression of the disease by sequestering proteins and gradually lead to degeneration Apart from the traditional advantages in genetics the recent advances in CRISPR system and bioinformatics have become a powerful driving force that will surely aid Drosophila research to ascend to the next level For instance Liu and colleagues have developed an improved RNA CRISPR system that is highly efficient for creating desired mutagenesis in the Drosophila genome with a mutagenesis induction rate up to et al O and colleagues have expanded the system through repair to facilitate complex genome engineering enabling the insertion of sizable DNA sequences to create targeted and conditional knockouts et al The CRISPR system can also be used for tagging of endogenous proteins Koles et al In contrast to the UAS overexpression system which sometimes may change the localization patterns of proteins retains the endogenous protein localization patterns Furthermore it achieves labeling allowing researcher to dissect functions of the protein of interest Next generation sequencing is now widely available and the access of disease information is also becoming more convenient for Drosophila geneticists as well Online databases such as FlyBase has even introduced Disease Model recently further facilitating the studies of human diseases using the fruit fly et al With the development of these techniques and databases we expect many new and improved fly models of human diseases to emerge soon In conclusion Drosophila is a useful in vivo model system that can reveal novel mechanistic insights into human disorders providing the foundation for translational research and therapeutic development Looking into the future we anticipate the tiny fruit fly to continue playing an important role in gene and drug discoveries in the

practice No use distribution or reproduction is permitted which does not comply with these terms Although the genus Bifidobacterium was originally named for its bifid morphology not all bifidobacterial species have a similar structure and very few of them adopt a bifid shape under stress conditions The exposure of respective bifidobacterial species to various conditions such as different pH temperatures medium components in vivo growth in Caenorhabditis elegans and subculture did not affect their diverse morphologies Extensive scanning electron microscopy studies suggested that the bifid shape of B adolescentis are maintained irrespective of the conditions Hence we conclude that the bifid morphology is intrinsic to B adolescentis Most bifidobacterial species are anaerobic and whereas after the first generation they become microaerophilic or aerophilic CaCl of B animalis signaling triggered a change from the rod shape to the bifid shape and vice versa in B adolescentis bifid polymorphic Bifidobacterium intrinsic aerophilic microaerophilic Introduction The genus Bifidobacterium is so designated because in the reference species one end was a and the other longitudinally split Tissier Various bifidobacterial species have been classified based on the nucleotide sequence encoding the rRNA and also called phosphoketolase However the lack of research into the taxonomy of the genus Bifidobacterium has meant that these species have been retained in Bifidobacterium regardless of morphological differences Because very few bifidobacterial strains have a bifid shape even though some are polymorphic both and species are retained in the single genus Bifidobacterium Investigators in the field such as Weiss Blaurock Boventer Weiss and Rettger and Tomarelli et al b have stressed the demand to develop optimal media for bifidobacterial s pecies The reflection of variations in the bifid structures of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus acidophilus was confirmed by Herter Bliuhdorn Kendall and Haner Since then some have suggested that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are two different genera Sundman et al Exposure to stress conditions causes the latter to adopt pleomorphic forms including the bifid form These observations were confirmed by Rodella Cruickshank Roos and Synder et al who reported that the alternative forms are uncommon and give an illusion of branching Norris et al confirmed that stress conditions induce the polymorphic forms of Bifidobacterium However the mechanisms underlying the bifid conformation are unknown and there has been no account of this polymorphic bifid morphology Therefore in this study we investigated the bifid nature of Bifidobacterium Studies of polymorphic bacterial morphologies by Moro and Tissier demonstrated that organisms are present in the fecal material of breastfed infants Populations of these organisms in the intestine represent the condition and are physiological significance However the cellular elements and physical parameters responsible for the upkeep of the bifid form in vivo and in vitro are yet to be determined According to available reports there are about different Bifidobacterium species The nomenclature and taxonomy of these microbes are incomplete Hence it is critical to understand the diverse nature of Bifidobacterium and to determine the characteristic morphologies of all the Bifidobacterium It is essential to determine whether this polymorphism is intrinsic to a particular species of Bifidobacterium Weiss and Rettger reported that these bacteria lose their bifid structure and change to the form in the subculture Moreover before subculture they are strictly anaerobic whereas after subculture they are aerobic The mechanisms of all these phenomena are yet obscure In this study we examine the polymorphic morphologies of the Bifidobacterium and conclude that the bifid morphology is an intrinsic characteristic of B adolescentis whereas other species including B animalis display polymorphic behavior only under stress conditions However all the other bifidobacterial species maintain their rod shape regardless of the culture conditions and rarely adopt the bifid shape In the Homma et al showed that univalent cations induce this unique phenomenon Kojima et al confirmed the role of monovalent cations including sodium chloride sodium sulfate sodium nitrate tribasic sodium phosphate and sodium acetate in the induction of the bifid form Later the roles of chlorides of Ca Ba Mg Mn and Zn were shown to play no role in this pleomorphism Kojima et al In the glucose and sucrose were also proven to positively affect this polymorphism Kojima et al Tissier L bifidus was the only organism that was exhaustively dissected for its morphological variability However this work was incomplete because many bifidobacterial species are recognized today and many comparative morphological studies have not survived In response to the original studies the name Bifidobacterium was suggested but was considered equivocal even then In those days fewer Bifidobacterium species were available and L bifidus may have been the only recognized bifidobacterial species In and L bifidus was the only strain in which this polymorphism was investigated Kojima et al demonstrated the role of CaCl in inhibiting various bacterial morphological forms The comparative study Kojima et al of cell wall composition of the bifid and bacilloid forms reported are clearly shown the restriction of amino acid phenylalanine and methionine to bifid form and the presence of high content of the glucose compared to bacilloid form Surprisingly larger peptidoglycans were found in the bacilliform whereas the peptidoglycans occur in the bifid form These observations also support the contention that Bifidobacterium is a misnomer Not all Bifidobacterium shows the bifid morphology because it is not an intrinsic characteristic and may be restricted to very few members of the genus To examine the different morphologies of the species included in the genus Bifidobacterium we selected several bifidobacterial groups constructed by Bottacini et al each selected species corresponds to a particular group and subjected them to different stress conditions The different Bifidobacterial groups were fed to the model system Caenorhabditis elegans to assess their morphological changes during in vivo stress conditions and was characterized and analyzed through scanning electron microscopy In this manuscript we report our findings on the varied morphologies of the Bifidobacterium detected with SEM and compound microscopy Materials and Methods Organisms Bifidobacterium species including B animalis B longum and B adolescentis etc were obtained from the German collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Braunschweig For details see Table C elegans and OP Escherichia coli was a kind gift of Dr Balamurugan

coli A gift from Prof Balamurugan B Refers to Bifidobacterium Media and Culture Conditions Commercially available media such as MRS Milano and Bifidobacterial broth Laboratories Swastik Disha Business Park via Vadhani Industrial Estate L B S Marg and agar medium were used to grow the different Bifidobacterial species The first generation of the Bifidobacteria was cultured in MRS broth also in Bifidobacterial broth when at in an anaerobic chamber for h They were and grown in aerobic condition in the second generation Growing Harvesting and Growth Curve Studies Bifidobacterial strains B animalis B longum and B adolescentis were grown at different temperatures room temperature and The bifidobacterial strains were streaked onto the MRS agar plate to produce single isolated colonies The streaked plates were incubated at under anaerobic conditions A single colony was isolated used to inoculate ml of fresh MRS medium and grown in an anaerobic growth chamber An aliquot of each inoculum was subculture in ml of fresh MRS medium to construct growth curves The bacterial samples were collected every h and the OD measured All the experiments were performed in triplicates Growth Maturation and Harvesting of C elegans C elegans were obtained from CGC and maintained on NGM at The standard E coli strain was used as a food source Age synchronized young adult worms were used in all experiments Synchronization was obtained through bleaching of gravid hermaphrodites to obtain eggs that were plated onto seeded plates The young adult nematodes were harvested from NGM plates by using buffer and used for experiments Was grown on NGM agar plates and fed internationally accepted feed standard E coli as described previously Ward Standard techniques Hope Stiernagle for the maintenance and growth of nematodes on NGM were used Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions for C elegans Feeding Escherichia coli was grown overnight at at rpm in medium The bacterial lawns used for the C elegans studies were prepared by spreading of the bacterial strain onto nematode growth media agar in plates The plates were incubated overnight in an incubator at They were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before they were seeded with C elegans and incubated at throughout the experiment All the bifidobacterial strains cited in the Table E coli were grown as shown above Bacterial lawns were made by spreading of the bifidobacterial strains onto MRS agar in plates A similar procedure to that described above was followed but C elegans was fed different Bifidobacterial B longum and B adolescentis strains rather than E coli B longum and B adolescentis were considered further for these studies as it is preferred by the C elegans The second generation of this bacteria is microaerophilic therefore they can grow in aerobic condition where C elegans also grows Chemotaxis Assay To determine whether the Bifidobacterium and their products are and safe for C elegans several experiments were performed Brenner The procedure follows as below A Petri plate was divided into four parts two opposite and one adjacent part labeled B and and the remaining as All the sectors B C and were equidistant from one another Part A contained B animalis part B B longum part C the control E coli and part D B adolescentis Approximately C elegans that had been grown on E coli were washed thoroughly and introduced into the center of the plate and the origin was marked with a circle to allow worms to be eliminated The plates were incubated under optimal conditions and analyzed the following day All the bacteria were equidistant from the center where the worms started their journeys The numbers of worms in each bacterial sector were scored after and h and the chemotaxis index was calculated by using the following formula CI Worms on test bacterium Worms in E c o l i Total number of worms Phenotypic Observations of Bifidobacterium C elegans and C elegans as a Model Organism to Understand the Polymorphic Morphologies of Bifidobacterium Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a model organism to determine the ability of the nematode to consume Bifidobacterium and to understand the intrinsic morphology of B adolescentis Different Bifidobacterium B animalis B longum and B adolescentis were grown in the appropriate medium as described above They were harvested washed and resuspended in the appropriate medium C elegans were fed with different ratios and so of Bifidobacterium and left for h They were harvested at different intervals h and so without rupture and then smashed so that the internal microbes could be observed The worms were washed fixed with glutaraldehyde after a series of wash animals were crushed on the slide and analyzed with SEM The phenotypic changes in the nematodes fed Bifidobacterium were observed microscopically The cells of B adolescentis worms were also lysed and the supernatants observed with SEM and the bacteria were quantified Bifidobacterial B longum and B adolescentis Colonization of the C elegans Digestive Tract The method of Garsin et al with minor modifications was used to estimate the approximate numbers of bacterial cells in the worms Ten worms were selected and the surface bacteria were removed by washing the worms times with of buffer on agar plates Each worm was transferred to a ml centrifuge tube containing of buffer and mechanically disrupted with a Microtube pestle Specialties Inc Lodi CA The volume was then adjusted to with buffer dilute and and the numbers of bacteria units were estimated by spreading the culture on MRS agar plates The plates were incubated at the appropriate temperature until the colonies were observed The same colonies were washed well with buffer and immediately fixed and observed with SEM Genomic DNA was isolated from some bacteria and subjected to rRNA amplification and alignment Understanding the Bifidobacterial Morphology through SEM Scanning electron microscopy studies were conducted to understand the diverse morphology of Bifidobacterium Various Bifidobacterium species were subjected to different conditions including different media or Bifidobacterium and different temperatures MRS at room temperature or for SEM and Growth curve They were also grown in MRS medium three generations with or without amino acids mg asparagine glutamine serine or individually with alanine asparagine tryptophan etc in the presence and absence of CaCl Husain et al and on MRS with and without salts M Na SO M NaCl or M CH Kojima et al the effect of salt concentration and at different pH The pleomorphism of Bifidobacteria was understood by growing them in vivo C elegans The Procedure Followed for SEM The various bifidobacterial strains were harvested and washed twice with phosphate buffer The pelleted bacteria were fixed in glutaraldehyde and incubated at h overnight The cells were then harvested and washed with a gradient of ethanol The cells were resuspended in of absolute alcohol Approximately of the sample was placed on a cover slip dessicated and examined with SEM The images were collected at magnifications Only appropriate and convincing images were considered in the analysis Genomic DNA Isolation The commercial GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit Inc Harrington Court Burlington ON was used for genomic DNA isolation In brief a single isolated colony was used to inoculate ml of MRS broth and grown overnight at without shaking under anaerobic conditions The following day the cells were harvested and heat treated at in the presence of of lysozyme in HCl and EDTA buffer After treatment with proteinase K RNAse A was added and the cells were incubated for min at room temperature The resulting mix was centrifuged at rpm for min and the supernatant was transferred to a GeneJET column After two washes with wash buffer the DNA was finally eluted with Tris buffer rRNA Amplification Sequence Analysis and Alignment The genomic DNA extracted as described above was used as the template for the PCR amplification of rRNA using the universal primers and DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase The cycling parameters were initial denaturation at for min followed by cycles at for s for s and for min and a final extension at for min Each reaction was analyzed on agarose gel The resulting PCR products were subjected to DNA sequencing with an ABI DNA sequencer Sequence similarity was determined with the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST tool Results The analysis of the rRNA nucleotide sequences and showed distinct differences between the Bifidobacterium species From the group three species were chosen for the study as they symbolize all the Bifidobacteria species Certainly temperature does play a major part in the growth of Bifidobacteria All together the three species B animalis subsp lactis accession no B adolescentis accession no and B longum accession number grew well at reaching an OD of after h of culturing Figure When the temperatures were reduced to the growth rates were drastically reduced Figure The whole of the Bifidobacteria species were unable to come to an OD of even after h of growth Nevertheless considerable growth was observed for B adolescentis The remaining two Bifidobacteria grew very slowly and an extended lag phase was discovered When the growth curves were observed at an increased temperature of Figure an outcome similar to that discovered at lower temperatures was observed Figure Nevertheless the cells did not obtain an OD above even after h of growth These results indicate that may be an optimal temperature for the growth of these bacterial strains Figure The growth curve studies further emphasize that B animalis subsp lactis is very slow growing an OD of and it maintained this growth rate at different temperatures B longum showed the greatest growth rates at and its growth rate was greater than either of the other strains Strikingly B adolescentis grew faster at reaching an OD of in h a task which takes h at and h at FIGURE Growth curves of DSM B animalis subspp DSM B adolescentis DSM B at different temperatures Three different Bifidobacteria such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis B animalis and B longum was grown under different concentrations of oxygen and their growth curves analyzed The results clearly demonstrated that as the concentration of oxygen in the system increased the multiplication rate of the bacteria decreased and vice versa not The different Bifidobacterial species displayed different resistance and susceptibility to oxygen the first In the second generation all the species grew aerobically irrespective of the presence different of oxygen An oximetric study also showed that each Bifidobacterium species required different amounts of oxygen for growth especially in the first generation This further confirms that Bifidobacteria does show intolerance in the IInd generation equally it is sensitive in the first generation Beerens et al Kawasaki et al Ruiz et al To investigate the various morphologies of the Bifidobacterial species they were subjected to various conditions and analyzed with SEM Figures The experiments were performed at different temperatures Figures B in different media supplemented with an amino acid mixture containing alanine aspartate glutamate and serine Figure and also individually supplemented with alanine Figure asparagine Figure tryptophan Figure or salts such as M CH COONa Figure and M NaCl Figure The growth rate of the bacteria varied between species when the temperature was increased All the species reached stationary phase after h at and after h at Figures C Rather than considering all different species of Bifidobacterium we selected species representative of the groups of Bottacini et al B animalis B adolescentis and B longum Bottacini et al We subjected them to different conditions and observed any morphological changes with SEM Figures clearly demonstrates the effects of each condition on the Bifidobacterial morphology Bifidobacterium adolescentis metamorphosed from a bifid to a rod when grown on medium supplemented with alanine asparagine or M NaCl When B longum was grown on medium supplemented with the four amino acids Asp Glu and or separately with alanine or asparagine its morphology changed from elongated rods to bifids However B animalis subsp lactis remained in the rod form irrespective of its growth conditions FIGURE Scanning electron microscopy of strains DSM B animalis subspp lactis DSM B adolescentis DSM B with different conditions like media with alanine aspartate glutamate serine media with alanine media with tryptophan media with asparagine media with M sodium acetate media with M sodium chloride Supplementary Data to Understand the Other Bifidobacterial Species Another five species B thermacidophilum B infantis B asteroides B animalis and B breve was also subjected to the different conditions described above and the results are shown in the Supplementary Figure We noted a marked change in the morphology of B thermacidophilum from to when grown on medium containing tryptophan When B asteroides was grown at a mixed population of and bacteria were observed Morphological changes were also observed when B breve was grown with all four amino acids or with alanine alone when it metamorphosed from to cells Bifidobacterium infantis changed from rods to coccoids at Almost all the other strains of Bifidobacterium maintained the rod shape under all the conditions tested except as noted above These findings confirm that B animalis maintains its rod form irrespective of the conditions implying that this morphology is an intrinsic characteristic Therefore B animalis may be used as a reliable control when investigating the bifid nature of B adolescentis MRS at and under anaerobic B adolescentis and B animalis control for rod were exposed to other variable conditions including various pH Figure for different growth periods Figure and in different concentrations of salt Figure The bifid shape was maintained by B adolescentis under all the conditions tested whereas the control B animalis retained the rod form The bifid shape of B adolescentis were also retained when it was grown for three successive generations under normal conditions Figure in all of which the bifid shape was retained This further affirms that the intrinsic bifid nature in the case of B adolescentis and rod shape in the case of B animalis FIGURE Scanning electron microscopy of strains DSM B

Scanning electron microscopy of strain DSM B animalis subspp lactis and DSM B adolescentis in different salts with varied concentration FIGURE Scanning electron microscopy of strain DSM B adolescentis at three different generations We also found that most Bifidobacterium species stably maintained their morphological shape irrespective of the conditions As shown in the Figure all the Bifidobacterium species were intrinsically except B adolescentis Few of them adopted the bifid structure and only under stress conditions Figures D F G B longum where C D conditions corresponds to B breve in the Supplementary E condition corresponds to B thermacidophilum in the Supplementary and D F G conditions corresponds to B adolescentis C refers to the combination of four amino D refer to E refers to F refers to G refers to M sodium However B adolescentis is intrinsically and maintains its bifid morphology irrespective of the ambient conditions Caenorhabditis elegans as a Model Organism for Pleomorphism Studies To understand the bifid form of B adolescentis and the forms of other Bifidobacterium C elegans was fed with different Bifidobacterium species and observed microscopically and by SEM Based on chemotaxis study B adolescentis and B longum was considered for the study Only B adolescentis maintained the bifid shape in the gut of C elegans The B adolescentis C elegans were dissected and centrifuged and the supernatant was spread on an MRS agar plate The numbers of bacteria were counted The bacterial genomic DNA was isolated and the rRNA was amplified and analyzed confirming that the isolated bacteria were B adolescentis The same culture was also subjected to an assay which confirmed the bacterial identity The same bacteria were examined with confocal microscopy Figure which confirmed their bifid morphology Bifidobacteria species other than B adolescentis maintained their intrinsic rod shape in the digestive tracts of the worms confirming that this is their intrinsic shape and changes only under stress conditions FIGURE Confocal images of B adolescentis at different magnification Bifidobacterium is the Preferred Food of C elegans Experiments were performed to understand the ability of C elegans to consume Bifidobacterium The food chosen by C elegans from among probiotic organisms and a control was estimated both qualitatively Figures and quantitatively Figure and represented as the CI The CI for B longum was and at and h respectively and was for B adolescentis at h C elegans contained no B animalis or B adolescentis at h indicating that C elegans had not selected them To validate the bacterial morphology in vivo nematodes that had consumed B longum or B adolescentis were fixed and examined with SEM to determine the shapes of the bacteria at different magnifications Figure FIGURE Chemotaxis assay and chemotactic index for understanding the food of choice among the other strains by the Caenorhabditis elegans in comparison with control Escherichia coli vs DSM DSM DSM and in combination with all If CI represents complete preference for E coli represents complete preference for the test bacterium represents an equal distribution FIGURE Morphology of B adolescentis and B longum in C elegans with different magnification DSM B adolescentis in C elegans DSM B adolescentis in C elegans DSM B longum in C elegans DSM B longum in C elegans The results in the Figure clearly show that the nematodes greatly preferred Bifidobacterium to E coli as its staple food Caenorhabditi s also expressed a preference among the three different Bifidobacterium species tested so C elegans may be the best model organism in which to investigate this polymorphism of Bifidobacterium We assayed the preference of C elegans for bacterial species B longum B adolescentis and B animalis The nematodes showed a preference for B longum over B adolescentis and B animalis Figures The histogram shows the CIs of C elegans for bacterial strains B longum B adolescentis and B animalis at and h Figure The data are the means SD of three independent biological replicates The health benefits of probiotic microbes are only observed when they reach the colon after passing through the small intestine and large intestine During their progress they are exposed to very harsh conditions To understand the effects on their morphology these Bifidobacteria were subjected to different pH When exposed to increasing pH Figure B adolescentis slowly became coccoid with a dramatic reduction in bifid bacteria At pH they maintained the bifid structure but as the pH increased to the bifid structure started to diminish and at pH and the number of coccoid structures predominated although no pointed elongated rods were observed Figure This phenomenon indicates that before it reaches its destination the morphology of B adolescentis changes frequently to accommodate the ambient conditions Bacterial movement may be faster in the coccoid state and this state may be favored when no adhesion is required For adhesion a larger and rougher bacterial surface area is required and therefore a bifid shape is favored Thus B adolescentis always maintained its bifid shape unless it senses adverse conditions when its morphology changes When Bifidobacterial species were grown in the presence of different salts M sodium acetate or M sodium Kojima et al SEM clearly showed that there were no dramatic changes in their morphologies Figures H A slight elongation of the rods was the only visible difference between B longum and control B longum Importantly the presence of lower concentration NaCl did not affect the morphology of B adolescentis and its bifid structure did not change to the rod form The bifid structure was observed at lower concentrations of salt and as the concentration of salt increased the bacteria assumed the rod shape The rod structures started to diminish at a salt concentration of M whereas the bifid form started to shorten until at M salt no bifid structures were seen Figure condition of B adolescentis Scanning electron microscopy also showed that Bifidobacterium other than B adolescentis adopted the bifid form but only very rarely and only under stress conditions Figures Therefore it is clear that the bifid form is an intrinsic to B adolescentis but not to the other Bifidobacterium species although a few Bifidobacterial species adopt the bifid form under stress conditions Kojima et al reported that changes to the bifid form occurred in different generations of Bifidobacterium but our study clearly shows that the first second and third generations of B adolescentis maintained the bifid morphology Figure Dramatic changes in B adolescentis were only observed when it was exposed to different pH when it adopted a coccoid shape Figure Therefore the number of bacteria was much higher depicted in the initiation of coccus formation but reverted back to the bifid form CaCl plays a significant role in the conversion of Bifidobacterium from the bifid shape to the rod form suggesting the involvement of calmodulin or a similar molecule This phenomenon was observed when B adolescentis were subjected to different concentrations of CaCl As the calcium concentration increased the cells became short and bulging with terminal buttons and they also aggregated Figure We examined B longum in experiments similar to those described above because it bears an intrinsic elongated rod structure As recorded in Figure no dramatic changes were observed under different conditions except when the cells were exposed to their rod structures changed to extend elongated rods At higher oxygen concentrations they aggregated and became elongated with button hyphal structures at their ends When the concentration of oxygen was reduced the structures and cell aggregation decreased not A low concentration of calcium chloride caused some defects including cell shrinkage the formation of wrinkles or holes etc As the levels increased from to M the cells started out to change from to extensively elongated rods as well as the bifid form At all concentrations of CaCl the ratio of B adolescentis were drastically reduced in number Figure DSM Structural alterations of different Bifidobacterial species subjected to different conditions are summarized in Figure FIGURE Bifidobacterial species subjected to different conditions and their response are shown in the form of a wheel Shows summary of the Bifidobacteria and their morphologies after exposure to different conditions Different strains of Bifidobacteria and their inter changed morphologies after subjected to different conditions are depicted bifid shape elongated rod short rod cocci different conditions Discussion Many researchers have claimed that the Bifidobacterium species are strictly anaerobic but no research has supported this theory From our findings we conclude that the Bifidobacterium species are microaerophilic because they can grow in the presence of a certain level of oxygen after the first generation Weiss and Weiss and Rettger reported that L bifidus and L acidophilus is closely related and are variants of the same species This hypothesis was rejected for lack of evidence Subsequently reported that B bifidum should be included in the order Actinomycetales Weiss and Rettger later concluded that respect were two different kinds of Bifidobacterium type is aerobic and unbranched during primary isolation and type is anaerobic and branched Weiss and Rettger proposed that all these organisms should be retained in Lactobacillus but not in Actinomycetales Established on the hypothesis of Weiss and Rettger the Topley and Microbiology and Microbial Infection and Manual of Systematic Bacteriology adopted this classification then proposed that the genus name should be converted to Corynebacterium It was reasoned that the use of different growth media for these bacteria may have caused the confusion concerning their nomenclature These matters remain open today because most of these species are nevertheless brought up to as Bifidobacterium although most are In using simple microscopy Masami Kojima found that cations play a significant role in the initiation of the bifid form Nevertheless we found that cations do not play a substantial role in bifid formation although they induce the formation of elongated rods To see the effects of NaCl on the bifidobacterial bifid and rod shapes B animalis subsp lactis and B adolescentis were grown in media containing M salt Figure Kojima et al Both strains maintained their intrinsic morphologies although at M NaCl B adolescentis reverted from a bifid to a structure Figure The B adolescentis changes its intrinsic nature of bifid to rod when they are grown in bifid media Supplementary Figure and remains same in the presence of amino acid such as asparagine tryptophan alanine Supplementary Figure which is necessary for the branching of the bacteria Husain et al These present studies showed that CaCl plays a major part in abolishing the bifid shape which is the intrinsic morphology of B adolescentis Nevertheless no significant conclusions were drawn from Kojima et al research group involving the effects of cations on the bifid form of Bifidobacterium Kojima et al concluded that a environment induces the bifid state whereas the presence of calcium induces the bacilloid form Yet in the present study CaCl induced the bacillus form of B adolsecentis despite its intrinsic bifid morphology Therefore although the bifid form is the intrinsic morphology of a few Bifidobacterial species this is not absolute CaCl may be considered a suppressor of the bifid state supporting the proposition that there are calmodulins proteins in the Bifidobacterium species Our SEM analysis clearly shows that the growth medium broth or and different conditions as various temperatures pH and do play a major part in the pleomorphic morphology of the Bifidobacterium The presence and absence of amino acids did not affect their morphologies converting the rod structure to the bifid form or to cocci or the bifid form to the rod form Not all Bifidobacterium have a bifid morphology and only a very few are intrinsically such as B adolescentis It is in this study that the intrinsic morphologies of these bacteria are and all but a few do not adopt the bifid form even after exposure to stress conditions Thus the rod structure is the intrinsic morphology of most bifidobacterial species These data confirm the theory that the name Bifidobacterium is a misnomer Therefore taxonomists must revisit this name by picking up more data in the near future As we expected Bifidobacterium was the intellectual nourishment of choice for the eukaryotic model system C elegans although the standard food offered C elegans experimentally has been E coli The nematodes tended to indicate a preference for Bifidobacterium over E coli C elegans also differentiates among the Bifidobacterium as seen in Figure Of the three Bifidobacterium species given as food C elegans preferred B longum over B adolescentis and B animalis The morphology of Bifidobacteria is intrinsically the external factors have anything to do with the same example B adolescentis Equally it is the only strain out of eight tested in our study retained its bifid shape in the extremities Author Contributions D executed the RK conceptualized planned designed analyzed Interpreted results and wrote

cited properly The end of the industrial era began from the middle of the twentieth century and the world has entered a new era of information and communication The rapid developments in science and technology were the driving force of this transformation In the century the need for qualitative and quantitative changes in access to information and knowledge resources is quite evident Without a doubt one of the most important resources for quick and easy access to updated research and scientific contents for researchers and scientists is academic journals These journals contribute to the quantitative and qualitative development and evolution of research and they are very important tools for solving underlying problems in the field of sciences and community and also the transfer of knowledge between scientists and the community The development of universities institutes and research centers led to increased scientific findings and subsequently the increase in the number and diversity of academic journals Currently scientific journals are highly specialized in various topics In each topic over tens to hundreds of specialty and subspecialty journals are published Therefore the need for ranking and separating journals from journals is quite evident and necessary Although the content of human scientific findings is growing with incredible speed the issue of concern is accelerating the publication of academic journals on the scientific contents and findings of researchers According to data published in Scientometrics journal growth rate of publication of scholarly journals is more than per therefore the number of journals was doubled in the period of years The growth was in such a way that the number of scholarly journals in the year was estimated about and according to above growth rate years later in it reached to about Recently the number is estimated to be with reference to the double increase during the previous years However it seems that this estimation of growth rate and total numbers is not a correct calculation and far from reality On the other hand the STM report about the occasion on celebrating the anniversary of scientific and scholarly journals has revealed that the number of active scholarly journals was in English language and in other languages in In addition the research of Arif Jinha at Ottawa University declared that the number of scholarly articles passed million in It is estimated that million articles will be added in this collection annually If the last two above numbers and million are taken into account it seems that the number of about is more similar to reality for scholarly journals and two or even one million are too far from reality Despite the crucial role of academic journals in the development and dissemination of science and knowledge especially high quality journals a lot of scholarly journals do not have minimum quality requirements Unfortunately as the number of publishing journals increases the number of fake and low quality journals also rises The growth rate of scholarly journals is estimated to be about per however this rate for published articles is less than This led to intense competition among the journals to get top quality therefore it is obvious that the journals with lower quality and discipline are inevitable losers in this competition Moreover although open access strategy of many scholarly journals is an excellent policy for free access of scientists researchers and students to updated research and knowledge but this makes the suppliers to receive the cost from students research centers and universities and transfer it to the authors of articles As a result a lot of journals for meeting their expenses are forced to accept low quality papers All of us as researchers who have at least a few articles published in qualified journals are witness of this struggle and competition between journals when we receive various and frequent to supply their expenses Therefore a systematic review on outline including their establishment identity of owner identity of publisher financing supplying evaluation and publication of articles and finally quality assessment and condition of journals should be performed by the scientific community and professional societies Actually the scientific community is a wanderer in a real forest of scholarly journals

always been regarded as a social phenomenon and therefore to understand the incident values and beliefs norms and in short the culture of any society should be scrutinized Since the concept condition and value of childbearing is associated with cultural social political and economic dimensions it has undergone various transformations during passage of time from past to present The sociological approach of the current study investigated the evolution of the concept and value of fertility and childbearing in light of historical social cultural and economic upheavals This study shows that the methods of rationalizing and legitimizing decisions about fertility and childbearing are defined and specified in the context of society The rational for selecting the decisions is intermingled with social cultural economic and political evolutions of the society like modernization urbanization and the level of development in human communities Today fertility childbearing and the number of children are not only connected with the interpretations of the individuals about the conditions and micro and macro subjective and objective factors surrounding them but they are also linked with factors such as family income the amount of time parents allocate to their children quality of child nurturing and other family variables Childbearing Cultural change Individualism Social change Socio economic transformation Introduction Fertility is deemed as an important event for couples during connubial life In all cultures worldwide fertility is a necessary and desirable goal to the extent that it is conceived as the ultimate ideal in life During the development and evolution of societies various aspects of reproduction have been generated and that is why despite the expansion and development of societies economic growth and technological advances inability in childbearing in many places is still a justifiable reason for disruption of couples and relationships concept of fertility during history as one of the significant goals of creation has transformed into a social expectation and is a pivotal factor in explaining and evaluating the status of individuals in the society Through a survey on the history of civilizations and different societies it reveals that the great portion of mythology religion rituals and traditions literature and art which are reflexives of values and cultural norms in particular societies is allocated to concepts and symbols of reproduction and childbearing Such a huge volume and range of works and cultural beliefs about fertility in all parts of the world unfold the significance and status of childbearing and reproduction as the permanent human desire for survival and immortality For most individuals the concept of family is formed by the birth of children Instinctive emotional and social needs of individuals after marriage propel couples to have children In human mind and instinct the concept of evolution and immortality is intermingled with reproductive power and childbearing and thereby the biological psychological and social success in life is contingent upon reproductive power of individuals and the fulfilment of expectations In terms of demographics the fertility and is also a remarkable phenomenon among the four main events of life Childbearing like other human phenomena has multiple cultural social economic and political dimensions Hence in very long historical processes its place and value has undergone several changes In this study an attempt was made to scrutinize the significance of fertility and childbearing in the light of social and economic developments The concept of family fertility and childbearing in history Throughout history the family functions have been inextricably bound with the living and generally economy the production distribution and consumption During hunting and fishing period families were homogenous and extended A lot of people lived under the same roof and consumed collected food resources and the prey and their sex relationships were defined In agricultural societies economic activity leads to greater productivity and the emergence of extended families In this period with an increase in the number of family members more fields are cultivated and the harvest is plentiful In this course individual families were formed and through the change in type of work men and women took responsibilities for the economic roles In addition in this period women were responsible for However in industrial period the role of human beings as the main workforce in the economic turned out to be negligible and families became more limited with fewer children In modern and postmodern era part of the social promotion of the family is investing for the future generations Higher levels of fixed income in families with two children in comparison to families with more children provide better recreation nutrition and educational facilities and ultimately results in better nurture of children In fact the transition from an economy to an economy with a complex nature based on modern services and the importance of the level of expertise of human as working resources were the impetus to alter the priorities Therefore the significance in number of children was replaced by the quality of their nurturing and the necessary skills and information required for each individual to work efficiently in the labor market In a society based on agriculture there is a relationship between the family and the organization for agricultural production More specifically the family as a group and the organization for agricultural production are mixed together and they construct a single coherent team In such a community all members of the family are involved in the production each member is responsible for part of the team work In such a society the task of financing for the life expenses based on the needs is on the shoulder of the family and it seems that the main responsibility of a rural family is childbearing Thus having a child is deemed as a kind of social prestige for the rural family Urban families are the developed types of rural families In urban lifestyle such features like having more privacy less neighborliness and separation of work place and living place are common In urban lifestyle consumption luxury freedom media and virtual environment are the typical characteristics In fact modern families share the usual features of the modern world namely urbanization It seems that lack of child and infertility is less destructive for urban families in comparison to rural ones The biological process of reproduction is influenced by complex social and environmental factors surrounded by social organizations beliefs norms and practices and in different cultures it has multiple manifestations Also the process is embodied in politics economics law religion and kinship Today the social value of childbearing has changed and like the old time childbearing is not deemed as the practice for production of working power and the concept is dependent on cultural economic and political conditions in each period In a traditional society infertile women are perceived as having incomplete sexual identity and are worthless These women are exposed to violence marginalization and threads of divorce or remarriage of their husbands In Iranian and Islamic culture marriage is deemed as a positive value and parenthood is the ultimate end for the couples in the family framework The concept of family is vivified with the practice of childbearing In this vein infertile women would face many limitations problems and psychological pressures Women who fail to achieve motherhood are deemed as defeated females and unfeminine and therefore they make their hard attempts to solve the problem by any means Such enormous pressures on women can be traced in one of the important works of contemporary fiction stone on a and the masculinely narrated story of writer and his wife for having a child depicts such tortures Of course nowadays in many societies the importance of as the determining factor for identifying a woman has been reduced to some extent Theoretical approaches to the concept of The concept of childbearing and fertility are encircled by religious values and beliefs norms and in short the culture of any society In fact it is influenced by social cultural and political factors in each society so that even in times of war or peace increase or decrease in birth rate are affected by social and political philosophy of that specific society In the following part the proposed theoretical approaches each focusing on a determining factors involved in fertility are scrutinized Attitude and religious beliefs Religious orientation for sociologists like Durkheim is one of the main cultural factors in childbearing But in the modern world particularly with emphasis on personal relationships and the saliency of privacy individualistic interpretations of religion become thus the deep ties faith belief and conscience as collective features with relatively strong religious characteristics are less seen among individuals In such an environment daily life loses its spiritual sense and thereby family like other social institutions transforms from its initial state and the previous religious beliefs and opinions would be changed Weber defines religion as a belief system which constructs the essence of powers and it is an independent and affective variable which has influence on all social aspects besides individual and social life According to Durkheim and theory with the change in religious beliefs in society fertility rate will change as a consequence The public culture in Iranian society holds childbearing in high regard both religiously and historically Children are considered blessing from God and childlessness is unpleasant In one study the failure of government to control the population in the years is attributed to the lack of approval regarding the policy by scholars and clerics and the success of the government in the policy for controlling the population in the years after is ascribed to the role of religious leaders and their support in using birth control methods Utilitarianism and exchange theory Utilitarianism and exchange theory specify economic factor as affecting the tendency in childbearing and consider personal benefit as the motivation for the practice In this theory the social group is simply a set of individuals who make the group for their personal benefit and predicting and explaining the behavior of individuals is contingent up on their motivations which are based on their From the perspective of the school people are rational calculative individuals in costs and benefits In their constant interaction with others they keep their own interest in mind Thus any kind of relationship with others is deemed as an exchange Social exchange theory shows that the interaction between two people may alter according to estimates of received rewards and the spent costs In this perspective the relationship between husband and wife is an exchange that starts from the beginning of life Accordingly all human relationships are based on subjective analysis of the costs and benefits and their comparisons When the couples based on calculation of profit and costs evaluate the benefits of having children they decide to have a child though it reduces the possibility of their social participation In contrast if the couples estimate the costs of having children are more than the benefits the tendency to have the child would be reduced In this approach the indicators of economic satisfaction and child care costs are important in estimation and parents assess the outcome of these indicators and estimate the costs and benefits for having a rational decision about having children besides the number In fact in this theory the fertility behavior is the result of rational economic decisions Community involvement Community involvement is another key factor in childbearing and the scholars focused on its effect for changing the patterns of life the German sociologist refers to reduction of family functions as a problem In his view through the evolution in industry the internal structure of the family is destroyed and its secondary functions such as financial education and health functions the care for the elderly and even the leisure have been granted to institutions and governmental social and economic agencies On the other hand the shrinking of families and their powerlessness from economic perspective provide a barrier to protect the elderly and sick family members In modern societies the family members dedicate a lot of time to their leisure and thereby the members based on their talents and expertise are able to choose a separate job besides their traditional hereditary jobs Friendly clubs and associations have reduced the function of childbearing whereby people have the convenience and comfort to actively participate in society and social events In modern social relations women enter the labor market and they change the family structure by their employment so there would be a delay in their motherhood Therefore the participation of women in society is an important factor in the decline in childbearing Social acceptance Social acceptance is another important factor in the regulation of fertility Several theories have been proposed to explain the social acceptance Among them one can refer to Fazio Fishbein and Ajzin theory Fazio mentions controlled and automatic cognitive processes In his view controlled cognitive processes reinforce the relationship between attitude and behavior Therefore information and experience have pivotal roles in this vein Some part of the experience is related to attitudes of people in society about social acceptability or of social of a social action as and the attitude in turn can inhibit the social action or increase the motivation for doing it In Fishbein and Ajzin view contrary to previous theory in which attitudes have direct influence on formation of behavior the attitudes have indirect impact on behavior and their target is our thereby intentions mold our behavior In other words according to this theory the behavior is rooted in intentions and the intentions for the behavior are rooted in the attitudes toward the behavior expected benefit and benefit and that subjective norm expectations of important people or the expectations of others and the motivation to follow the expectations of Based on Fazio Fishbein and Ajzin each individual in his decision making for any act incorporates the opinions of friends groups parents and community If the person in performing a specific action such as childbearing is informed about the social acceptance of her behavior intentionally or not she would follow the otherwise she would not put the decision into practice Based on the theoretical frameworks the effective indices in childbearing will be examined in the context of social economic political and cultural history of societies Effective indices in reducing the rate of Until half a century ago childbearing was a natural process in the world and each family had an average of six children But during the transition to modernity and in light of the individual cultural social factors and even international policy this trend has changed and was hastily reversed so that today fertility in many countries is a social challenge for the following decades The Family Protection Act of Iran also indicates the importance of fertility in Iranian society According to Article of the Act infertility can be one of the reasons for divorce and if one of the spouses applies for divorce it is permitted to be performed The slope of population graph in Iran like many other countries is downward This reduction has many reasons Among them literacy increasing urbanization increased employment of women and implementation of government policies for population control are effective factors Government efforts to control the population in the past two decades led to a cultural belief that reduction in childbearing should be an accepted model In fact this trend is in line with demands of society and the ideals of couples and it is not easy to be changed unless a more powerful and rational culture at different levels of society replaces the old one Another contributing factor to the decline in fertility is the change in the structure of the family Some of these include changes in individual social and cultural levels Changes in individuals The promotion of individualism an increase in age of marriage the growth in divorce rate increased levels of education and employment of women are some individual changes Among these individualism has a key role in reduction of childbearing which will be reviewed The concept of individualism Individualists try to promote the goals and objectives of the individual and they value independence and They prioritize the interests of the individual rather than the government or social group interests and individual is the focus of attention In individualism all the collective rules and regulations are defined in terms of individual rules strength faith personal and people are considered free empowered and responsible individuals for their actions when facing many forces and pressures The development of individual values and individualism in contemporary Iranian society is a widespread event In large cities like Tehran the examples of the development of individualism are evident For instance of people in Tehran believe that most individuals only think of themselves and pointed that one cannot trust anybody Now Iranian families which in their traditional framework were usually collective and religion oriented have individualistic features and the evidences are clearly seen in their ceremonies and gatherings Nowadays individualistic gatherings like birthdays graduation and celebration in which the main themes are the respect for the individual replace the collective national holidays like New Year celebration and religious ceremonies Examples of individualism The most crucial examples of individualism include the tendency to have fewer children and improvement of the quality of lives regardless of the family as an institution and children The reduction in number of children and families is not a demographic event but more importantly is a fundamental upheaval in the pattern of family life From this perspective the small family can be described as one type of cultural pattern since this institution has many cultural implications for all aspects of family relations In a study in on the ideal number of children for citizens of Tehran having two children by the highest frequency of and having three children by the lowest frequency of indicated the opinions of citizens in Tehran In this study of the population preferred not to have children at all and the choice reflects the revolution of values and cultural transformation in and fertility Therefore the tendency to have fewer children and a better life is a modern claim which attracted many fans in the past few decades in Iran The results of the analysis suggest that the tendency of the families to have few children in the society today is the offshoot of the change of patterns and gender especially the role of women in the family In the modern time the main role of the women in the family unlike the traditional families is not pregnancy and raising children Women in modern societies as social beings have distinct identities and are independent in urban areas Moreover learning knowledge and skills and employment are as important for them as creating the family Therefore based on the results of the investigations in a city like Tehran families have tendency toward fewer children and new types of families are emerging in which there is the absence of any children The relevant evidence is related to the statistics which show that in the year of the families in Tehran were childless and of them did not have any grandchildren Such families did not exist in Iran in the past but in recent years the Iranian families are free to delay childbearing or remain childless during the rest of their life Therefore unwanted childbearing and unplanned pregnancies are obsolete practices and in turn childbearing is now a systematic planned and rational action in which the couples determine its suitable time and the number of children The experience of families in Tehran reveals that such planning culminates in reduction in the number of children Today experience and desires interests tastes and their feelings are gradually developing In the past women did not have a high status in public arena but the status of women within and outside the family has got a prominent place nowadays since women are now more aware of their rights and the global status of lives in the world Moreover through modernization they have achieved more social freedom In other words the most important variable that determines the equal responsibilities of men and women in household chores is the awareness of women about the global conditions and globalization This kind of awareness and knowledge is not acquired in vacuum but is the result of different factors like the use of information and communication technologies social networks and mass media Another outcome of globalization is the division of responsibilities in household chores participation in about affairs economic participation in activities outside the home political participation changes in lifestyle and the increase in social and cultural capital of the family which all compensate for the unpaid responsibilities of women in the house All of these changes and redefinition of the role identity and status of women in social arena can be seen as examples of the development of individualistic thinking in the society Social changes Among the social changes the transformation of families from extended type to nuclear one the increase in the rate of urbanization in recent years and economic problems which eventually lead to unemployment and inflation are more prominent All these factors result in reduction of childbearing rate In addition among families the inflation in the economy of the community has always been associated with economic insecurity Therefore the current condition of the urban society in Iran besides global factors makes the couples cautious in their decision for having children and leads the couples to have only a single child or remain childless Cultural changes Among them one can refer to factors like the women tendency to work and participate in society which reflect the change in women attitudes towards marriage marital role and motherhood By being employed women are not considered as the inferior sex anymore because they can underpin their identity in the work place and their identity Also consumerism is a new trend in the modern era that has altered the lifestyle of families With the development of consumerism the living costs increase which culminate in a decline in childbearing From another perspective some changes of Iranian families like having a single life temporary marriages initial agreements to delay having children for or years later or agreement to remain childless but adopting a child are the great shifts which are required to be investigated in detail The issue of equality of women and men is one of the cultural revolutions Before the modern era females were considered the inferior sex However the attitude changed gradually and women believe that in both social arena and in family they have rights similar to men In the context of family women are more cautious about their physical capital The change in the physical appearance of women who experience pregnancy once and who experience pregnancy three times is apparent causing women to be more worried than their husbands about losing their physical capital Thus the importance of physical capital for a woman becomes so crucial that the agreement for having only one child in marriage becomes a significant criterion In addition in recent years the supports in having fewer children as a serious dialogue regarding rights are fully approved Maintaining and strengthening the economic and social capital for women are the typical examples of equality in rights in society A woman with a single child compared with a woman who has more than three children is more successful and active in her social responsibilities According to opinion large number of children leads to marginal role of women both in public and in working environment For this reason especially in big cities of Iran and among women the tendency is towards having fewer children Discussion The investigations indicate that fertility and childbearing have been exposed to immense alterations from the beginning of creation Since human beings are rational individuals in facing the environment and the means which are at their disposal they make decisions about the structure of their lives These options are chosen by the individuals in terms of cultural social economic and political considerations of the particular society The methods to rationalize and legitimize decisions about fertility childbearing and delivery do not occur in a vacuum Selection and decision processes are somehow entangled with social cultural economic and political upheavals including modernization urbanization and the development of human societies Childbearing is not necessarily a biomedical event and numerous studies have shown that individuals and interest groups especially women have various beliefs perceptions and experiences of childbearing and childbirth or childlessness whether intentional or unintentional The concepts and meanings related to this event favor considerable cultural or intercultural diversities in human societies and rationalization and legalization of these decisions and behaviors besides the narrative process of the issues relevant to fertility are related to economic social and cultural context of the particular society Today the number of children is not only connected with the interpretations of the individuals about the conditions and micro and macro subjective and objective factors surrounding them but it is also linked with factors such as family income the amount of time parents allocate to their children quality of child nurturing and other family variables conditions of Since the traditional division of responsibilities is the common practice in the family and women spend most of their time to raise their children there is the chance of increasing the number of children in the family However the gradual significance of human resources and the presence of women married in labor market and their prominent role in economics of the family in conjunction with their increased level of education result in the collapse of the traditional division of responsibility in the family and consequently the number of children would be reduced In sum it seems that population growth in case of ignoring the existing infrastructure of a country economic growth market potentials the quality of education and other unenumerated factors will be followed by negative consequences Worthy to mention that changes have more direct and quick effect on the attitudes and decisions of individuals who made a family or decide to create a family in comparison to the policies of the government With higher levels of education and the increase in living costs the reduction trend in population growth will continue and the trend cannot be changed by centralized and planning In industrialized countries for the prevention of aging in the population and having a reasonable population size social welfare policies are strengthened and with application of levers of economic employment and social welfare such as giving subsidies giving time off to people maintaining job and social encouragement families are motivated to have more children For example the Medal of Honor would be granted to a French mother who has the maximum number of children in a year Such incentive programs have a great role in increasing the rate of childbearing in any particular community Conclusion Childbearing or having few children or unintentional childlessness as a social practice is under the influence of institutional resources and the structure of society and religious beliefs and Utilitarianism and exchange On the other hand the interpretations of people about the forces and conditions in the community are determining factors in the practice The institutional resources for defining the practice can be local or international and the resources have connections with interpretations of the people about the practices and actions Consequently people rely on these resources and use their creativity and recognition of the needs to make the decision about childbearing Acknowledgement The authors thank Homa Mahmoodzadeh and Sepideh Hanifehzadeh for editing of this paper Conflict of Interest The authors declare no

from the material as long as the author of the original work is cited properly Background The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of human ovarian vitrification protocol followed with in vitro culture at the morphological and molecular levels Methods Ovarian tissues were obtained from normal transsexual women and cut into small pieces and were divided into and vitrified groups and some of the tissues fragments in both groups were randomly cultured for two weeks The morphological study using hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome staining was done The analysis of mean follicular density estradiol and anti mullerian hormone and was down for the evaluation of expression of genes related to folliculogenesis Data were compared by and T test Values of were considered statistically significant Results The proportion of normal follicles did not show significant difference between vitrified and groups before and after culture but these rates and the mean follicle density significantly decreased in both cultured tissues The expression of genes was similar in vitrified and groups but in cultured tissues the expression of and FSHR genes increased and the expression of FIGLA and genes decreased An increase in and AMH concentration was observed after days of culture in both groups Conclusion In conclusion the present study indicated that the follicular development and gene expression in vitrified ovarian tissue was not altered before and after in vitro culture thus this method could be useful for fertility however additional studies are needed to improve the culture condition Estradiol mullerian hormone Gene expression Vitrification Introduction At present there are some reliable options for preserving fertility in cancer patients Dysfunction of gonads occurs due to the toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy However some of these methods such as ovarian tissue cryopreservation are still considered experimental Cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue was done at first in by Hovatta et al and at now it is performed by slow freezing and vitrification methods This methods are considered complex because of the nature of human ovarian tissue which consists of different cell types More attempts have focused on improving ovarian tissue cryopreservation by vitrification It is an cooling process that produces a solidification of cells by high concentration of cryoprotectants The effects of vitrification on the morphology ultrastructure and function of human ovarian tissue showed conflicting results Also at the molecular level there were limited investigations to evaluate the gene expression of human ovarian tissue just after vitrification and warming procedure Recently Shams et al demonstrated that after vitrification warming of human ovarian tissue using dimethylsulphoxide and ethylene glycol the expression of gene related to folliculogenesis did not change Isachenko showed the expression of glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase gene in vitrified ovarian tissue was reduced Abdollahi et al showed that the expression of some genes involved in apoptosis have changed after vitrification and warming of human ovarian tissue In vitro culture of ovarian tissue following the cryopreservation is an alternative method for follicular maturation and also for assessment of safety of cryopreservation technique During in vitro culture of ovarian tissue the follicles are in connection with stromal cells that provide the factors for initiation of growing of follicles although by tissue culture the normal structure of follicles within the tissue is maintained Several genes are expressed and they controlled the development of follicles from primordial to ovulatory stage Factor in Germ Line alpha is expressed by oocytes in primordial follicles and it has an important regulatory role in the expression of the zona pellucid glycoprotein and the formation of primordial follicles The mice with homozygous mutation in FIGLA genes are unfertile because of defects in the formation of and Growth differentiation is a family member of transforming growth and is expressed by oocytes at a primary follicle stage and controls of gene expression in granulosa cells The mice with mutation in have arrest in the primary follicle development Kit ligand is expressed by granulosa cells and induced proliferation of theca cells and transition of follicle from primordial to primary stage It also increases the mRNA level of several growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor in theca cells The follicle stimulating hormone receptor expression is required for differentiation of granulosa cells and follicular maturation Oktay et al demonstrated that the FSHR gene was not expressed in any of primordial follicles while was shown in all of secondary follicles According to our knowledge there was very limited information regarding evaluation of expression of genes related to follicular development after in vitro culture of cryopreserved human ovarian tissue Recently Wang et al demonstrated that vitrification the mRNA levels of and anti mullerian hormone after short term in vitro culture of isolated follicles derived from cryopreserved human ovarian tissue In vitro culture studies of human ovarian tissue is the best insight into the effects of vitrification warming procedure on the expression of genes related to folliculogenesis thus the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of human ovarian vitrification protocol using ethylene glycol based solution followed by in vitro culture at the morphological and molecular levels by assessments of the follicular survival and density and the expression of genes related to follicular development The function of ovarian tissue was evaluated by the level of estradiol and AMH Methods All reagents and materials of this research were obtained from except mentioned otherwise Experimental design In this study in order to assess the effect of vitrification and in vitro culture of human ovarian tissue on follicular survival and the growth and expression of some genes related to follicular development the ovarian fragments were divided into two and vitrified groups and some of the tissues fragments in both groups were randomly cultured for two weeks The following assessments were done for and cultured tissues as the same The morphology of tissues was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin and Trichrome staining The expression of genes related to folliculogenesis and was evaluated using PCR before and after two weeks of in vitro culture period The and AMH assay was done in collected culture media in the beginning and end of the culture period Ovarian tissue collection An informed consent was collected from normal transsexual women to aged years old under a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical Science of Tarbiat Modares University No The ovarian tissue samples during laparoscopic surgery were obtained and then were transferred to the laboratory within hr with sterile ml tubes containing ml and equilibrated medium supplemented with mg ml human serum albumin IU ml penicillin and ml streptomycin The ovarian cortical tissues were cut into small pieces mm under a sterile condition The tissue taken from each woman was randomly divided into vitrified and groups fragments in Vitrification protocol The ovarian cortical fragments were vitrified according to the protocol described earlier by Salehnia et al with some modifications Vitrification solution named EFS containing ethylene glycol v v ficoll w v and M sucrose was supplemented with HSA The human ovarian tissues were equilibrated in three changes of vitrification solutions for min and then they were placed into cryovials containing vitrification solution The cryovials were put on the nitrogen vapor phase for s immersed and stored in liquid nitrogen until assessment after one month Warming of vitrified tissue The fragments were warmed by immersing the cryovials in C water bath with gentle agitation until melting the samples Then they were washed serially in M sucrose and phosphate buffer I containing mg ml human serum albumin at room temperature for min The samples were equilibrated in essential medium culture media for min In vitrified group fragments in fragments were considered as tissues Among these tissues fragments were fixed in solution for histological evaluation and fragments were stored at C for molecular assessments The remaining vitrified fragments were cultured in vitro for two weeks The samples were also considered for histological and molecular assessments in the same as vitrified group Ovarian tissue culture and vitrified tissue fragments were cultured fragments in individually in culture plates for weeks in of supplemented with mg ml HSA mg ml penicillin G mg ml streptomycin ml insulin transferrin selenium IU ml human recombinant follicle stimulating hormone at C in humidified air with CO At hr intervals the half of culture media was removed and replaced with fresh medium The collected media were stored at C for subsequent and AMH hormonal analysis After weeks the cultured tissues fragments from women in both were fixed in solution for histological evaluation and the others were stored at C for subsequent molecular assessment Tissue evaluation After fixation of tissue fragments they were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin wax Five micrometer thickness serial sections were cut and the sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with Then each section was examined for follicular counting Another set of serial sections was stained with MTC staining and observed under light microscope for evaluation of stromal tissue Follicules counting The follicles were counted at different developmental stages field by field under objective lense of the light microscope according to the classification described by Gougeon To avoid counting the follicles more than once only those with an obvious nucleus of oocytes were counted The follicles containing a single layer of flattened granulosa cells were considered as primordial those having cuboidal granulosa cells in a single layer identified as primary and those having two or more layers of granulosa cells identified as growing follicles having two or more layers of granulosa Atretic follicles had oocyte with a pyknotic nucleus of oocyte and granulosa cells and shrunken ooplasm Assessment of mean ovarian follicle density per mm The photomicrographs of each tissue section were prepared and imported into Image J software Institutes of Health Then the area of each section was measured in units of pixels and converted to millimeters based on the conversion determined by measuring the image of the calibrated millimeter Tissue volume was calculated as the sum of the area in mm of all tissue sections analyzed per patient multiplied by mm thickness of each to give a value in mm The number of follicles in each histological fragment was categorized according to their stage of development as previously described Then mean follicle density was determined by dividing the total number of follicles per patient by the volume of tissue analyzed and expressing this value as follicles per cubic millimeter RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted from and vitrified groups before and after culture using Trizol reagent according to

groups not only before culture but also after culturing period In addition our results demonstrated that the vitrified samples have follicular development such as tissue Optimization of vitrification method for human ovarian tissue using cryoprotectants with low toxicity effects is an important subject in the field of cryobiology In several studies it was shown that ethylene glycol is a permeable cryoprotectant and had the best results in terms of survival of tissue The adequacy of the which mainly composed of ethylene glycol in the preservation of follicles has been shown in various studies From another point of view our morphological observations using MTC staining showed that the stromal tissues were preserved normally in vitrified tissue similar to the samples It is concluded that the cryoprotectants solution which was used in this study had no harmful effects on the integrity of stromal tissue and the stromal cells and tissue were well preserved Similar to our results Fabbri et al showed that after vitrification warming the stromal compartment maintained morphological and features similar to the fresh tissue The stromal cells play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of the granulosa cells so their preservation during cryopreservation procedure is critical The interaction between stromal and follicular cells and the integrity of these components for normal ovarian function is important Moreover in other parts of the present study it was demonstrated that the proportion of normal follicles did not significantly decline after two weeks of in vitro culture in comparison with the tissue In addition the growing index increased in both cultured groups It seems that the culture media which have been used in this study could sufficiently support the activation and development of primordial follicles Different in vitro culture systems were introduced for follicular development and these systems have showed different results However the supplementation of culture media with PTEN inhibitor could activate the follicular development in the present study Similar reports showed that PTEN inhibitor affects human ovarian follicle development by promoting the initiation of follicle growth and development to the secondary stage Our molecular analysis by real time showed that the profile of gene expression related to development of follicles was similar in vitrified and ovarian tissue and also during two weeks of in vitro culture this pattern was not changed in comparison with group This observation is parallel to data obtained from developmental potential of vitrified samples than ones It is concluded that vitrification of human ovarian tissue using solution either has no remarkable effect on the morphology and follicular development and on the expression of developmental genes related to primordial primary and secondary follicles during in vitro culture In addition at the end of in vitro culture period the expression of and FSHR increased and the expression of FIGLA and genes was reduced in comparison with samples As mentioned before the expression of FIGLA and genes is related to primordial follicles and and FSHR genes correspond to primary and secondary follicles thus this data revealed an increase in the number of growing follicles from primordial to primary and secondary stages In addition studies on the effects of culture period on the gene expression of vitrified human ovarian tissue were limited The level of as a marker for ovarian function during in vitro culture was analyzed and our results showed that an increase in the level of at the end of culture period in comparison with the beginning of culture is correlated with the increase in the proportion of growing follicles during culturing period The estradiol hormone was produced mainly by the granulosa however the stromal cells could contribute to steroid production For the first time the level of AMH was measured in collected media at the beginning and end of in vitro culture to show if this hormone could be a suitable indicator for demonstration of follicular development and reserve within the cultured tissue or not However the level of this hormone showed the slight changes during in vitro culture and this data may be related to small number of and small antral follicles within cultured ovarian tissue because AMH is expressed in granulosa cells of growing follicles in the ovary and the high level of AMH expression is related to granulosa cells of and small antral follicles In another part of this study the changes in the follicular density of human ovarian tissue were evaluated during in vitro culture in comparison with groups The results revealed that the decline in the follicular density was observed in both vitrified and samples This reduction may be due to the insufficient culture condition to provide essential factors for survival and development of follicles Other suggestion is that ischemic damages or other types of cell death may take place Thus additional studies for improvement of in vitro culture condition are needed Conclusion In conclusion the present study indicated that the follicular development and gene expression in vitrified ovarian tissue were not altered before and after in vitro culture thus this method could be useful for fertility however additional studies are needed to improve the culture condition Acknowledgement This study was part of the Anatomy Act of Tarbiat Modarres University and is completed with the financial support of the university Conflict

the role of leptin in sperm function is still controversial Our present study aimed at demonstrating the effect of cryopreservation on sperm DNA fragmentation and investigating the possible effects of sperm capacitation techniques and leptin in vitro incubation on sperm DNAf and oxidative stress Methods Samples of normospermic men attending for infertility investigation at Vida Centro de Fertilidade Rio de Janeiro Brazil were frozen and thawed with or without capacitation and leptin incubation prior to freezing Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by Sperm Chromatin Dispersion Assay before and after cryopreservation and oxidative stress parameters were measured by spectrophotometry with and without leptin incubation Statistical analysis was performed using paired t test to compare DNAf between groups before and after cycle to compare groups before and after capacitation and leptin incubation and oxidative measurements before and after leptin incubation Statistical significance was considered when Results Our results revealed a significant rise in sperm DNAf compared with fresh samples Sperm DNAf was significantly reduced when sperm capacitation was performed before freezing when compared to those frozen with no previous capacitation The addition of leptin to capacitated sperm before freezing reduced DNAf and enhanced superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase antioxidant enzymes activity Conclusion The addition of leptin to capacitated sperm can improve sperm DNA quality following cryopreservation possibly by inducing the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes DNA fragmentation cycle Leptin Oxidative stress Sperm Introduction Cryopreservation of gametes and embryos has a wide importance among assisted reproductive techniques Taken into account the spermatozoa cryopreservation has several applications such as seminal storage prior to prostate and vasectomy surgeries before chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments prior to fertility treatments and for donor sperm banking However sperm freezing and thawing processes lead to intracellular ice crystals formation which causes organelles and cell membrane rupture modifies the structure and integrity of plasma membranes and alters mitochondrial membrane potential and release of reactive oxygen species In addition cryopreservation has been shown to diminish the antioxidant activity of the spermatozoa making them more susceptible to ROS damage Oxidative stress occurs when excessive ROS generation overcomes the ROS scavenging ability of spermatozoa Spermatozoa and seminal plasma contain antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase although its lack of cytoplasm leads to a decrease of antioxidant defense Moreover spermatozoa are particularly more susceptible to lipid peroxidation because of the high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid in their membranes Deleterious effects of oxidative stress can result in several structural alterations of spermatozoa such as protein fragmentation lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation Increase in DNAf is related to reduced implantation and pregnancy rates and increased recurrent pregnancy loss In order to minimize deleterious effects of cryopreservation some studies have focused on testing antioxidants action on sperm cryopreservation Zhang et al observed a protective effect of leading to a significant improvement in sperm parameters including DNAf levels et al also observed a reduction of lipid peroxidation and DNAf following antioxidant supplementation of spermatozoa during cryopreservation Leptin a peptide hormone mainly secreted by adipose tissue is widely known by its functions related to obesity appetite and food intake inhibition and energy expenditure However it has been shown to have roles in diverse physiologic systems including reproductive system Although presence of leptin and its receptor has been demonstrated in spermatozoa its role on spermatogenesis and sperm still needs to be clarified Literature has some controversial results concerning sperm parameters after leptin in vitro incubation Lampiao and Du Plessis found an increase in total and progressive motility in acrosome reaction and nitric oxide production after leptin incubation In contrast the study by Li et al demonstrated no significant effects of leptin incubation on motility and percentage of capacitated and acrosome reacted sperm after leptin incubation Additionally studies have suggested that leptin has a role in oxidative stress which is still controversial Zheng et al demonstrated that leptin increased sod activity in cardiomyocytes while Yamagishi et al observed a lipid oxidation in endothelial cells However leptin role in oxidative stress and sperm cryopreservation remains unclear Our present study aimed at demonstrating the effect of cryopreservation on sperm DNAf and investigating the possible effects of sperm capacitation and leptin incubation on sperm DNAf and oxidative stress Methods Patients and semen analysis Semen samples were collected from normospermic patients aged years from November to June by masturbation after to days of ejaculatory abstinence attending for male infertility investigation at Vida Centro de Fertilidade da Rede in Rio de Janeiro Brazil Samples were collected into sterile vials and were left to be liquefied at C for min Semen samples were analyzed according to WHO criteria for concentration sperm ml and motility progressive motility or total and according to criteria for morphology normal The evaluation of concentration motility and morphology were performed using Neubauer chamber Makler chamber and Spermac staining TM Sperm Morphology kit respectively The criteria for exclusion from the study were urogenital infection varicocele hydrocele use of drugs and medications and other diseases such as diabetes mellitus obesity and malnutrition The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of University Hospital Pedro Ernesto HUPE and all patients provided written informed consent Experimental design In order to achieve the goal of this study an experiment was initially done comparing fresh raw and raw semen samples from patients to evaluate the effect of cryopreservation on DNAf Based on the results observed a second experiment was done using raw and capacitated semen samples from other patients In order to evaluate if leptin had some additional effect on the DNAf and oxidative stress of capacitated samples a new experiment was performed using other semen samples of previously capacitated treated or not treated ones with leptin Sperm cycle Samples were placed with cryoprotectants on cryovials and frozen in vapor liquid nitrogen for min followed by liquid nitrogen immersion Samples remained in liquid nitrogen for two months when analysis was performed For sperm thawing cryovials were taken from liquid nitrogen and immediately immersed in water bath at C for min Sperm capacitation For sperm capacitation samples were centrifuged at g for min using density gradient centrifugation solutions of and The supernatant was then removed and the pellet was washed in ml human tubal fluid medium Irvine United supplemented with SPS Irvine United at g for min The supernatant was discarded and ml of medium was gently layered on the pellet Then the tube was inclined at an angle of degrees and incubated at C for hr The upper interface was aspirated to obtain the motile fraction which was divided in aliquots for leptin incubation Leptin incubation Capacitated samples were incubated with ng leptin at C and CO overnight before freezing The leptin dose was used based on previous studies Sperm DNA fragmentation assay Sperm DNA integrity was assessed using SCD assay Semen samples were diluted using concentration in melt agarose microgel and placed in pretreated slides Denaturing solution was used to denature nuclear DNA protein Sperm were lysed and dispersed a large or medium DNA halo in sperm cells and a small or none DNA halo in fragmented sperm cells At least spermatozoa per sample were examined at magnification by oil immersion The of SCD test is DNAf was performed to compare FR versus versus versus Oxidative stress mechanisms were evaluated in and Lipid peroxidation was evaluated through measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances at nm using a spectrophotometer Protein oxidation This method is based on reaction of acid with sulfhydryl group which was measured at nm using a spectrophotometer Antioxidant mechanisms were evaluated in and Superoxide dismutase In this method adrenaline undergoes oxidation by anion superoxide action which is inhibited by SOD activity This oxidation generates adrenochrome which is measured at nm with a spectrophotometer Catalase Catalase activity was measured by H O quantification at nm with a spectrophotometer nm Glutathione peroxidase GPx activity was determined through decay rate of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at nm with a spectrophotometer Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism version software Data are represented as mean and standard error was used to test normality of samples distribution Paired t test was used to compare DNAf between groups before and after cycle to compare groups before and after capacitation and leptin incubation and oxidative measurements before and after leptin incubation Statistical significance was considered when Results Sperm DNAf There was a significant increase in sperm DNAf evaluation after cycle compared to evaluation with the same fresh raw sample figure Besides that this increase occurred in such a way that of the samples classified as fragmented after cycle were found to be in the fresh raw evaluation Figure Percentage of sperm DNAf in fresh raw and samples Horizontal line corresponds to cutoff value of the Percentage of sperm DNA

GPx Antioxidant activity There was a significant increase in antioxidant activity of SOD table and GPx table when comparing samples with and without leptin addition However catalase activity did not differ between groups table Discussion While damage to motility viability morphology and fertility capacity is already well documented the possible DNA damage following sperm freezing is still not confirmed There appears to be some contradictions concerning whether or not freezing can affect and the extent of the effect on sperm DNAf Some authors reported a significant increase on sperm DNA fragmentation caused by cryopreservation while others suggest there is no harm to DNA integrity This controversy could be explained by several factors patients in the study of Ozkavukcu et al of the patients were smokers and it is known that smoking can alter DNA fragmentation different sperm capacitation techniques before freezing i e some studies used raw semen others have isolated sperm by washing or DGC different cryoprotectors were used in the different freezing and thawing and the use of different techniques to measure sperm DNAf In our study a rise in DNAf after sperm cycle was observed corroborating some previous studies In order to decrease the variability in the present study only patients who had no diseases or used no medication were evaluated Besides only normospermic patients according to WHO criteria were included in the study since sperm of infertile men are less resistant to freezing process showing poor results concerning sperm DNAf compared to fertile men In this study raw semen was used for comparison between before freezing and DNAf taking into account that raw semen has a strong antioxidant defense that could protect sperm against oxidative stress during cryopreservation which in turn could induce an increase on DNAf The present results can be explained by previous evidence that the process of freezing and thawing can lead to ice crystals formation provoking plasma membrane disruption organelle and nuclear membrane reaching cell DNA The mechanism by which these alterations occur is still unknown However a possible reason for this injury could be oxidative stress and the activation of apoptotic cascades There is still controversy in literature regarding sperm capacitation previous to cryopreservation Some studies observed better DNAf results by addition of cryoprotectors directly to raw semen supporting the idea that seminal plasma protects spermatozoa during cycle once it is rich in antioxidant enzymes Other researchers support that seminal plasma needs to be removed before freezing otherwise it can damage sperm motility and vitality after thawing Also sperm DNAf rates were compared using raw semen for cryopreservation and capacitated samples Our results showed that sperm preparation previous to cryopreservation had reduced sperm DNAf rates For sperm capacitation DGC was performed followed by sperm wash and pellet The likely reason why better results were obtained concerning sperm DNAf of capacitated sperm before freezing can be raised on the hypothesis that the morphologically abnormal sperm are more susceptible to DNA damage during the freezing process than sperm with normal morphology Additionally head abnormalities and irregular chromatin organization may have altered membrane physical properties and thereby have altered tolerance to cold stress By selecting a subpopulation of spermatozoa through sperm capacitation before freezing a better quality sample can be obtained after thawing This procedure allows selecting high quality spermatozoa and the removal of seminal plasma which contains germ cells not viable apoptotic and other components that can cause oxidative damage and apoptosis during freeze and thaw procedures Several studies have been searching for mechanisms to attenuate deleterious effects caused by cryopreservation Some of these attempt for a better sperm preparation before freezing some for an ideal freeze and thaw protocol and others for better cryoprotector agents As it is known that oxidative stress is one of the most detrimental factors during cryopreservation recent studies have been reaching for cryoprotective substances which could minimize this damage Due to its exclusive structural composition such as lack of cytoplasm which leads to decrease of antioxidant defense and a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid in their membranes making it more susceptible to lipid peroxidation sperm became more vulnerable to ROS actions Deleterious effects of oxidative stress can result in several structural alterations of spermatozoa such as protein fragmentation lipid peroxidation and membrane and DNAf This was the first study to focus on the possible cryoprotective effect of leptin on spermatozoa Our results showed that leptin incubation with capacitated spermatozoa before cryopreservation could lead to increase in antioxidant enzymes SOD and GPx but not catalase The major cellular enzymatic antioxidants are SOD catalase and GPx However catalase is known to be very effective in oxidative stress and especially important in case of limited glutathione content or reduced GPx activity A likely mechanism by which leptin can act against oxidative stress is by dissipating the excess energy via thermogenic mechanism and thus preventing the development of excessive mitochondrial membrane potential In another study Zheng et al demonstrated that leptin had effects on cardiomyocytes by increasing SOD activity Leptin signaling could induce gene expression and directly activate promoter in cardiomyocytes Interestingly this effect was specific for which is whereas the remained unchanged following leptin treatment In our study leptin did not change mechanisms Leptin does not inhibit ROS formation directly The reduction of oxidative stress is likely to be due to a rise of antioxidant enzymes activity Controversially leptin has shown to induce lipid oxidation in endothelial cells leading to increased mitochondrial potential and consequent elevation of mitochondrial production of ROS In the present study leptin also potentiated DNAf reduction in capacitated samples in relation to sperm capacitation It can be speculated that the reduction of DNAf after leptin incubation could be explained by increased antioxidant defense minimizing deleterious effects of oxidative stress during freezing and thawing processes In summary our results show that leptin has a cryoprotective effect and if added to the sample before freezing could reduce deleterious effect of cryopreservation However it remains unclear if the addition of this hormone could add value to in vitro fertilization techniques Conclusion Sperm DNAf increased after cycle compared to evaluation with the same fresh raw sample Sperm capacitation and leptin addition to culture media showed a cryoprotective effect on spermatozoa by reducing DNAf and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity However leptin did not inhibit ROS formation directly The addition of leptin to capacitated sperm samples before freezing could possibly reduce deleterious effects of cryopreservation Acknowledgement The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and Rio de Janeiro Foundation for Research Support Conflict of Interest

original work is cited properly Background Singleton pregnancy with a live birth beyond weeks of gestation is the ultimate goal of any assisted reproductive technology However singletons conceived after ART are found to have a poor perinatal outcome in comparison to naturally conceived singletons It was hypothesized that the outcome of singleton conceived after transfer of two or more embryos may be dependent on the sharing of uterine space with other embryos Methods Patients who had single gestational sac visualized at weeks after transfer of or embryos were considered for the study singleton pregnancies were selected for final evaluation such that as per implantation rates of and they were divided into groups of and cases respectively The basic characteristics of pregnancy age birth were compared using analysis of variance and categorical variables were evaluated with test The was considered statistically significant Results Among the various variables including maternal age conception type of infertility type of abortion total live birth gestational age in live birth birth weight kind of embryo transfer and gestational age there was not significant statistical differences between groups except gestational age that it was higher in group with implantation rate Therefore higher number of initial embryos may affect the perinatal outcome of singleton conceived subsequently Conclusion There is higher chance of missed abortion in patients with singleton pregnancies conceived after multiple embryo transfer Gestational age at delivery and birth weight were correlated with number of embryo transfered Assisted Reproductive Technology Embryo transfer Implantation rate Perinatal outcome Singleton pregnancy Introduction Singleton pregnancy is the desired outcome of any assisted reproductive technique With advances in the field of embryology and laboratory practices great advances have been made such that the average pregnancy rate per cycle has increased However implantation remains the bottleneck of any ART cycle Even though transfer of a single good quality embryo is advocated by most of the guidelines it has not become a routine practice globally Sometimes in certain circumstances as in repeated failure cases or owing to a limited ability to select the embryos with the highest chance for implantation a large cohort of embryos is transferred deliberately In all these cases though the chance of multifetal pregnancy is increased singleton pregnancies are also seen Limited implantation potential of the transferred embryo or of the uterus itself may lead to variable implantation rate of the cycle Different embryo transfer strategies have resulted in different multiple pregnancy rates ranging from in Siberia to in Sweden Therefore as the number of children born by ART is significant knowledge of factors affecting perinatal outcome in ART singletons is crucial It is known that singletons conceived by ART are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes whether this outcome is related to infertility itself ART technology or the embryo This study aimed to find if the obstetric outcomes are also affected by implantation rate Many previous studies have considered aspects which alter or influence implantation rate and thereby predict determine the number of embryos to be transferred This study examined implantation rate from a different perspective The purpose was to evaluate the perinatal outcome in singleton pregnancies as a function of different implantation rates This may help understand two aspects of conception does embryonic crowding initially affect the implanted embryo and does higher implantation rate translates into better reproductive and perinatal performance To the best of our knowledge there have been no studies evaluating the possible effects of implantation rate on singleton pregnancies resulting from transfer of or less cleavage stage embryos The purpose of this study was to compare the perinatal outcomes of singleton pregnancies according to implantation rate Methods This is a retrospective analysis done in the department of reproductive medicine and surgery at Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical sciences from the year to Women who conceived after in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection with a single gestation sac visible on ultrasound at weeks weeks after embryo were included in the study Records of the patients were studied to exclude patients with elective single embryo transfers blastocyst transfers with donor oocyte surrogacies and monochorionic gestation As this was a retrospective study informed consent could not be taken from patients Both fresh and frozen thaw cycles were included in the study For all cases in the study less than cleavage stage embryos transfer was done at a time The following data was recorded from case file of patients included in this age previous conception cause of infertility type of transfer or number of embryos transferred pregnancy outcome in terms of abortion live birth and birth weight at delivery Average number of IVF cycles was Patients who had chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus hypertension thyroiditis and autoimmune disorders were excluded from the study For purpose of stimulation antagonist protocol was used in all patients included in the study The stimulation started with recombinant gonadotropins from day or of cycle when estradiol levels were pg ml and ovarian quiescence seen on USG The dose of recombinant gonadotropin Gonal F serono SpA was decided as per age antral follicle count BMI and previous response to stimulation if any Gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist mg Serum Institute of India Ltd was initiated as per flexible protocol when at least follicle reached the average diameter of mm till the day of trigger Ovulation trigger was given using either IU recombinant HCG Ltd or leuprolide Laboratories Ltd mg when or more follicles reached an average diameter of mm The choice of trigger depended on estradiol values and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Patients given agonist trigger underwent cycle in subsequent months wherein down regulation was done using mg leuprolide Pharmaceutical International Pvt Ltd depot on day Endometrial preparation was done with estradiol valerate incremental Transfer was done when endometrial thickness was more than mm with trilaminar pattern All patients were given luteal phase support from day of oocyte retrieval till weeks of gestation in the form of micronized progesterone vaginal gel once daily East once daily Concentration of vaginal gel was gr in a pack which delivers mg progesterone Based on semen quality the oocytes were inseminated hr after oocyte retrieval with either ICSI or conventional insemination Fertilization was indicated by the appearance of two distinct pronuclei and two polar bodies hr after insemination The zygotes were cultured in cleavage medium Medical Embryonic development was assessed on day hr and on day hr after insemination Cleavage stage embryo transfer was performed using embryos with the highest number of blastomeres with the highest embryo score All embryo transfers were performed by the same person under ultrasound guidance and a serum pregnancy test was performed days after embryo transfer As per departmental protocol all patients had conceived after embryo transfer and had transvaginal USG done at around weeks weeks after embryo All patients were followed up every to weeks in the department till delivery abortion and records were periodically updated Missed abortion was defined as absence of cardiac activity at weeks of gestation Early abortion was defined as loss of cardiac activity or disappearance of gestational sac before weeks after documentation of live fetus at weeks Loss of fetus between to weeks was defined as late abortion Any birth after completed weeks of gestation of viability for present was considered as live birth with those between weeks being very preterm to weeks as preterm and after weeks as term birth Implantation rate was calculated by dividing number of gestational sacs seen by the number of embryo transferred or Quantitative data was expressed as deviation The basic characteristics of pregnancy age birth were compared using analysis of variance and categorical variables were evaluated with tests and t test as applicable of was considered statistically significant Ethical clearance from institutional ethical committee was taken for the study Results As per the inclusion criteria patients conceived with singleton after ART and delivered aborted by the completion of study period Depending on the number of cleavage stage embryos patients were divided into groups as per calculated implantation rate and The age and previous conception were similar in all three groups and the age of patients with an implantation rate of was lesser than the other two

transfer Implantation Rate Fresh transfers Frozen transfers Total Numbers in parenthesis denote percentage Discussion Embryo quality and endometrial receptivity are two determinants for pregnancy success in patients undergoing program With respect to embryos clinical data show that of embryos selected for transfer fail to implant To increase pregnancy rates multiple embryos are transferred which is responsible for complications due to multiple gestation pregnancy therefore it is essential to develop better understanding of implantation and factors determining its rate In an elaborate study done on rodent uteri embryo implantation at unfavorable site was postulated to be associated with pregnancy complication as well The authors also suggested that one cause of vanishing twin syndrome seen in IVF conceptions might be due to embryo crowding at implantation and subsequent resorption of one embryo as the result of competition for space and nutrient supply It is an open but intriguing possibility that maternal stress at the time of embryo transfer and or implantation may cause similar sympathetic activation of uterine adrenergic in humans resulting in embryo location and pregnancy complications Oren et al have demonstrated that embryo quality had no effect on perinatal outcomes but it does affect pregnancy rate and implantation rate Also in our study no significant association was found between live birth rate and birth weight and implantation rate in singleton conception deliveries However regarding gestational age at termination of pregnancy or a decreasing age with lower implantation rate was found Therefore it is believed that early pregnancy events may depend on implantation rate though once the singleton progresses beyond the shift number of initial embryos may not be relevant anymore Pinborg et al have suggested that with increasing fetal embryo number the obstetric outcome of surviving singleton is adversely affected They too have supported the hypothesis that early implantation site crowding leads to first trimester losses A found evidence that singleton IVF babies have higher risk of worse perinatal outcome in comparison to singleton of unselected spontaneously conceived women Also in this study it was shown that number of embryos transferred does not affect the outcome of a singleton pregnancy conceived consequently This in turn indicates that there may be factors inherent to ART technique or the infertile patient herself that may lead to poorer outcome This also looked into the evidence comparing perinatal outcomes of singleton pregnancies after single or double embryo transfer They found low quality evidence of similar outcome in both groups Our own result is similar when live births are compared However a slightly higher average birth weight and gestational age at delivery live were found when implantation rate was higher as against lower implantation rates and Even the percentage of abortion was higher in lower implantation rate group though none of these results reached a statistical significance A retrospective cohort study showed that in older women the chance of multiple sacs leading to delivery of multiple babies is low and likely reflects aneuploidy Therefore they have advocated a more aggressive embryo transfer strategy to maximize the chance of actual live birth In cases of multiple embryo transfer especially in absence of pre implantation genetic screening implantation rate will depend on the quality of the embryos themselves Presuming that only the best embryo implants in a singleton pregnancy it can be further concluded that this naturally selected embryo will have similar obstetric outcome irrespective of its initial competition In other words correct measure of uterine receptivity and embryo quality will help pre select the one embryo that will implant and thereby reduces the potential for multiple pregnancies ASRM guidelines have defined the number of embryos transferred on basis of patient age embryo quality the opportunity for cryopreservation and results of previous IVF cycles if any Transfer of multiple embryos or has been suggested in cases with relatively poor prognosis secondary to age previous failure or embryo quality For patients with previous IVF failures additional embryos may be considered for transfer However our study shows that as the implantation rate decreases chances of live birth also decrease Therefore in view of our own study it is believed that the best outcome in terms of live birth may be achieved by increasing the implantation rate by transferring better quality embryo itself In a large retrospective cohort analysis over ET after oocyte donation the authors concluded that as the number of embryos transferred per cycle increased so did the total number of cycles required to achieve a newborn This study also showed that percentage of miscarriage also increased along with total number of embryo transferred This study however did not evaluate or transfers per se and the researchers did not take into consideration the quality of embryos transferred Despite these differences the result of our own study appears to be similar Previous studies have demonstrated a poorer neonatal outcome in singleton pregnancies of ART especially in fresh transfers An improvement in the outcome with frozen transfers is attributed to better endometrial receptivity Our study shows that as the implantation potential improves the possibility of better outcome especially in terms of live birth also increases Hsu et al in their retrospective controlled clinical study found an inverse relation between implantation rate and number of embryos transferred irrespective of their quality A major strength of our study is that it was a single center study with close follow up by a single physician in all conceived patients Limitations of the study Our results are limited by the retrospective nature of the study and smaller numbers Due to the study design itself nature of endometrium at time of transfer and previously failed IVF cycles were not considered for evaluation Conclusion Our study shows that in patients with singleton pregnancies conceived after multiple embryo transfer there is higher chance of missed abortion which is significant if more than embryos are transferred However there is a correlation between the number of embryos transferred with gestational age at delivery and birth weight Conflict of Interest Conflict of Interest none References Practice Committee of the American

by the premature depletion of ovarian follicles before the age of representing one major cause of female infertility Mutations in bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor have been shown to be associated with POF Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from idiopathic premature ovarian failure patients and normal control individuals Exons of and gene were amplified using PCR method and subjected to directed sequencing Variants were identified by comparing the sequences obtained with normal sequences from NCBI database Results Four gene variants were identified in patients in heterozygous condition Out of these variants variants namely c c and c delT were novel variants In silico analysis using SIFT Provean and Polyphen score predicted the effect of c and c variant variant was identified in patients No variant was identified in gene in any patients and controls Conclusion Although the variant has been identified in gene but it may not be associated with the premature ovarian failure Bone morphogenetic protein Female infertility Gene mutation Growth differentiation factor Premature ovarian failure Introduction Premature ovarian failure is characterized by hyper gonadotropic ovarian deficiency with primary or secondary amenorrhoea It affects of females by the age of years by years and by years showing the one major cause of female infertility Ovarian function is regulated by a combined stimulus of gonadotropins follicular stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone and local ovarian factors such as inhibins activins bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor A familial accumulation of the POF syndrome has been observed in between and of the patients with POF which suggests dominant genetic etiology and belong to transforming growth superfamily Genes belonging to TGF superfamily regulate many aspects of development by activating transmembrane serine threonine kinase receptors has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth and promotes the progression of folliculogenesis from the primary stage to the follicle stimulating hormone dependent stage Mutations in gene have been found as a culprit for POF in several worldwide cohorts with a variable prevalence between and However Zhang et al and Ledig et al failed to find any association between and POF is also expressed in the oocyte and its products can form noncovalent heterodimers acting in a synergistic manner on the function of surrounding follicular granulosa cells gene variations in humans described so far in different ethnicities are all heterozygous affect exclusively the with a prevalence of and are not detected in the control samples Due to these conflicting results of various studies this study was planned to evaluate the association between growth differentiation factor and bone morphogenetic protein genes mutations with premature ovarian failure Methods Subjects Patients with a diagnosis of POF were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Sri Aurobindo Medical Collage and PG Institute Indore during the period between September and March A total of patients with idiopathic premature ovarian failure or insufficiency subjects with karyotype were enrolled in the present study The patients had a mean age of years Less than year old healthy individuals visiting the department for routine investigations were selected as the control group All the control individuals had a regular menstrual cycle and normal reproductive hormone levels and chromosomes The inclusion criteria of all participants were years of age duration of amenorrhea months serum FSH level IU l on two or more occasions with the presence of amenorrhea Individuals with a history of ovarian surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy or other factors which may damage ovarian functions were excluded The present study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Sri Aurobindo Medical Collage and PG Institute Written informed consent was

To determine the potentially deleterious effect of the amino acid changes Provean software http provean jcvi org index php SIFT software http sift jcvi org and Polyphen software http genetics bwh harvard edu were used Provean software predicts whether an amino acid substitution or indel has an impact on the biological function of a protein The SIFT software predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids Phenotyping predicts possible impact of amino acid substitutions on the structure and function of human proteins using straightforward physical and evolutionary comparative considerations Results Sequencing data collection and analysis were successfully performed for the and genes in all the cases and controls which included POF no variant was observed in the coding region of the gene of any case and control sample Four variants of gene were observed in cases which included two missense substitutions one in exon I and the other in exon II position Table FS was present in cases Three novel variants were observed in our cohort namely c T c and c Aln c T is the frameshift variant resulting in elongated chain and by dominant negative effect it impairs the function of normal protein The c Glu is a missense variant and changes the glutamic acid to asparagine at position Provean score for this missense variant was off score and SIFT prediction score was off Both of these scores predicted the neutral effect of this missense variant This variant was predicted to be benign with a score of specificity by PolyPhen software Table Sequence variation in the gene in POF patients Sequence variation AA change Protein domain No of patients No of controls Exon Exon Exon Del T Exon In other patients of POF c Aln missense variant was observed This variant also has neutral effect on the protein function as predicted by Provean and SIFT score PolyPhen also predicted this variant as benign with score of specificity The clinical characteristics of the patients carrying variants are detailed in table No variant in gene was observed in the control group Table Characteristics of patients having gene mutation gene variant Ethnic origin Age Amenorrhoea FSH level mIU ml Indian Secondary Indian Secondary Indian Secondary Indian Secondary Indian Secondary Indian Secondary Discussion POF is mostly portrayed as a heterogeneous genetic disorder but its etiology still remains elusive Studies have illuminated the comprehensive role of two oocyte derived growth factors and as the main driving force for the proliferation and progression of somatic follicle cells The gene plays a vital role in early human folliculogenesis and it is characterized as a strong candidate gene for POF is a member of the large superfamily of the transforming growth factor proteins involved in diverse cellular processes during embryonic development and tissue formation The main roles of include the promotion of follicle maturation from the primordial gonadotropin independent phases of regulation of follicular GC sensitivity to FSH prevention of GC promotion of oocyte developmental and regulation of ovulation quota In the present study four variants in gene were identified of which three variants were novel c and c Aln variants has no deleterious effect as predicted by in silico analysis Previous studies reported different variant C at the same position at which we observed C Similar to our prediction previous reports also shows no deleterious effect of this variant variant was observed in three patients in our study This variant has been identified in patients presenting with POF in many previous studies This insertion may be considered as a polymorphism as it was previously identified in controls as well This variant was not found in any of the control subjects No variant was observed in gene in either patients or controls This is in contrast to the study done by dixit et al and Laissue et al which show the variants in POF patients Conclusion In conclusion the present study provided evidence for naturally occurring variants in association with POF and points to the massive importance of as a vital candidate gene which should also be studied in other populations Although software assessment of the variants reveals their neutral effect their functional implication cannot be ruled out altogether Experimental studies should be conducted to determine the real implication of those variations Acknowledgement This study was

prior to however it is unclear if specific less invasive treatment cycles impact anxiety that is experienced in the pregnancy resulting from IVF Methods A prospective study was conducted for women who became pregnant via IVF and data was collected about reported previous treatment cycles as well as Pregnancy Related Anxiety Measure Latent Class Analysis was conducted A of was considered significant Results subjects participated and were highly educated affluent married and primarily white The LCA process yielded two groups that on average had similar levels on most items except for use of intra uterine insemination and or ovarian stimulation This information was used to generate four exhaustive and mutually exclusive groups Stimulation Only Stimulation and Intra uterine Insemination Intra uterine Insemination only or No Treatment ANOVA found that those in the Stim Only group had statistically significantly higher PRAM scores than the Stim IUI the IUI only group and the No Tx group Conclusion Women who become pregnant via IVF and had a history of in vitro fertilization cycles that only involved ovarian stimulation experienced more anxiety in the pregnancy that results from in vitro fertilization Infertility Intra uterine insemination In vitro fertilization Pregnancy anxiety Stress Introduction Fifteen percent of women worldwide experience infertility during their lifetime Use of assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization to treat fertility problems continues to rise due to successes and advances in science Despite this trend there is a lack of clear understanding of the psychological experience especially anxiety a woman experiences during the pregnancy that follows successful treatment with IVF Additionally it is unclear what may put women who ultimately achieve a pregnancy at increased risk for experiencing increases in anxiety in the pregnancy that follows successful IVF Understanding how anxiety is experienced during pregnancy is critical because of potential impact on pregnancy outcomes In the general preterm birth literature there is support for a positive relationship between anxiety and preterm birth Treatment for infertility is expensive and physically invasive which can be repeated for months or years before a pregnancy is achieved or the decision is made to discontinue treatment Treatment can vary greatly based on the diagnosis Most couples will be offered less invasive treatment options including ovulation stimulating medications with or without intra uterine insemination IUI without use of medication prior to ART including IVF Hersheberger Bergh and some will seek IVF upon definitive diagnosis of underlying infertility cause such as complete blockage of fallopian tubes or severe infertility thus bypassing less invasive treatment options Women who are being treated for infertility report increasing amounts of emotional distress during the treatment process with stress impacting emotional distress The emotional distress experienced can carry over into resulting pregnancy from infertility treatment Qualitative research has found that women who are pregnant following IVF experience their pregnancies differently than women who conceive without assistance specifically perceiving their pregnancies as special and hard won Additionally quantitative research has found increases in stress particularly anxiety in women pregnant via IVF as compared to women who conceive without assistance The process of infertility treatment can take a long time to navigate One study found that the average time spent on fertility care was hours in an period of time This translated to working days with the majority of time spent on visits with the provider Additionally there was a direct relationship between time spent on care and stress Data supports that emotional distress increases over time in treatment While anxiety has been shown to increase during a treatment cycle of IVF and length of IVF treatment has been associated with increases in stress what is less clear is whether utilization of specific less invasive treatment leading up to IVF contributes to anxiety experienced in a resulting pregnancy Therefore the aim of this exploratory study of women in the early second trimester of a pregnancy was to assess whether certain less invasive treatment options including ovarian cycles ovarian stimulation with IUI cycles IUI only cycles and no previous treatment affect anxiety levels Methods The study had a prospective design targeting a population of pregnant women via IVF Participants were recruited upon discharge to their obstetrician or midwife typically at gestational week from a large private infertility practice in the North Eastern United States Participation in the study commenced at gestational week and women who expressed interest were sent several reminders about participation until gestational week Inclusion criteria were female years of age single or twin fetus gestation between weeks and gestation and ability to read and write English Exclusion criteria included having a selective reduction in current pregnancy and being medically or obstetrically requiring perinatologist to follow the pregnancy Between weeks participants logged onto the dedicated website completed consent and answered the study questionnaires Approval was obtained from the New York University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects and all subjects provided informed consent prior to participation in this study The analysis sample included women which was as many participants that the study team had capacity to recruit and manage All participants provided informed consent and submitted study questionnaires Subjects completed survey questions about their demographic data as well as the number of previous treatment cycles for infertility prior to IVF including stimulated cycles i e clomiphene citrate or either with or without IUI IUI cycles or no previous treatment The demographic questionnaire included age marital status education income and race Clinical characteristics such as history of miscarriage number of IVF cycles and length of infertility were also collected Number of miscarriages was dichotomized as either a history of miscarriage or no history of miscarriage IVF count data was also recoded as either one IVF cycle or more than one cycle They were also asked about their perception of anxiety specific to pregnancy using the Anxiety Measure The Anxiety Measure is a scale assessed maternal fears and anxiety related to the health of the baby and the labor and delivery process and confidence in the obstetrician and other health care providers The revised version used in this study was comprised of an expanded set of items that was used to assess the extent to which women worry or feel concerned about their health their health labor and delivery and caring for the baby The anxiety score ranged from with a higher score indicating more anxiety The internal reliability of the scale was found to be acceptable Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample In order to explore groups of subjects in the database Latent Class Analysis was conducted to identify patterns with the group definition variables Unlike standard clustering techniques LCA allows for statistical testing of model fit and class membership is probabilistic with membership probabilities computed from the estimated model parameters In the initial step of the analyses increasingly complex models more latent were estimated to determine the optimal number of latent classes to fit the data Following standard practice the optimal number of latent classes was determined by comparing the Bayesian Information Criterion of the candidate models as well as applying substantive interpretability and clinical judgment to select between candidate models i e Do the classes defined by a given model possess a more discernible clinical significance or meaning than those defined by another model As described below the LCA process yielded classes of subjects which on average agreed on all response items except for use of IUI and or ovarian stimulation Post hoc to the LCA process four analytic groups were developed Stim Only Stim IUI IUI only or No Tx Groups were evaluated for differences in PRAM levels using ANOVA The level of significance was set at for each test due the exploratory phase of this research alphas were calculated on the PRAM Results Table presents a summary of the demographic clinical and PRAM characteristics of the women in the early second trimester of a pregnancy The mean age was years of to and the majority of the sample was Caucasian

Income at least White ethnicity Race Miscarriage history No One miscarriage Twin pregnancy Twins Number of IVF cycles One cycle Anxiety Tx only only IUI Significant at Discussion The present study sought to understand if certain previous less invasive infertility treatments leading up to a successful IVF cycle were associated with increased anxiety Surprisingly the findings showed that women with a history of stimulated only cycles i e clomiphene citrate and had more anxiety following a successful IVF than women who had more complex previous treatment including IUI or without or no treatment at all The subjects for this study were recruited from a very large Reproductive Endocrinology center that serviced a densely populated geographic area in the Northeast of the U S Typical care for women with fertility concerns was to initially be seen by their primary care provider for evaluation and possible treatment which could often include an ovulation inducing medication such as clomiphene citrate Sometimes these medications are prescribed for several cycles without a comprehensive medical evaluation of the underlying condition and following unsuccessful treatment the women are then referred on to the RE for complete evaluation and initiation of a comprehensive treatment plan For some a diagnosis of unexplained infertility is determined which supports utilization of IVF instead of less invasive methods such as IUI with or without ovarian stimulation therefore many of these women may not be treated with cycles that include IUI While these women have a tangible treatment plan those for whom no identifiable reason can be found for their infertility may be left with uncertainty about their status including the ability to maintain a health pregnancy Uncertainty in disease processes can have a significant role in how anxiety may manifest for individuals The unpredictability associated with not having a definitive diagnosis plays an important role in determining emotional responses and can create a reaction of sustained anxiety instead of fear For women who are experiencing unexplained infertility they have already had many unsuccessful natural cycles before even liaising with medical professionals If they continue under the care of their primary care provider they will experience even more cycles before ultimately seeking evaluation from the RE A comprehensive evaluation that ultimately does not find an underlying cause of the infertility may contribute to the feeling of unpredictability For those who ultimately achieve a pregnancy via IVF they acknowledge that their pregnancy was very difficult to achieve and if something were to negatively occur there is uncertainty they would be able to achieve another Women pregnant after IVF report certain activities that underscore their belief about the fragility of the pregnancy including checking for vaginal bleeding often and the feeling of assurance after each normal ultrasound scan When examining other literature the uncertainty of the diagnosis has been evaluated in women with infertility issues In one study researchers found that anxiety played a significant role for women with unexplained infertility going through treatment as compared to those with a definitive diagnosis because of a reaction to the ambiguous medical situation with its uncertain prognosis This anxiety can change throughout the evaluation and treatment process Early on the main anxiety was thought to be related to a physical inferiority complex while later it was influenced by anxiety related to what others outside the family say about the inability to conceive and give birth to a child In another study examining the psychological experience of infertility treatment over the course of several years women experienced an acute stress response to the initial diagnosis and treatment plan Emotional strain was higher during the first year and then dropped in the second year If treatment continued into year three this strain markedly increased Additionally aspects of personal relationship with partners were affected in the third year including negatively impacting marital adjustment and sexual satisfaction Not surprisingly the ambiguity and uncertainty of unexplained infertility causes a higher level of anxiety which has the potential to carry into the pregnancy Once pregnant women have more anxiety about whether the pregnancy will be successful This may be because of a perception that their body is and may lead them to think that whatever was the roadblock to achieving a pregnancy will also affect the ability to have a successful birth outcome In one qualitative study women who had previous unsuccessful treatments were more focused on possible physical problems in the pregnancy Having a better understanding of risk factors for anxiety experienced by women undergoing infertility treatment who subsequently became pregnant has significant implications for improved clinical practice For women still navigating the process of treatment having a comprehensive understanding of how women navigate the evaluation and treatment process will help providers better meet the psychosocial needs of women particularly those for whom no definitive cause of the infertility is found It is important to appreciate that this study represented women who continued treatment through a successful IVF procedure A substantial number of couples being treated for fertility will discontinue fertility care before achieving pregnancy with main contributing reasons for withdrawal including emotional distress and poor prognosis Only half of women with infertility will receive the treatment that is needed to achieve a pregnancy One significant contributor for this disparity is the discontinuation of care Many will stop for reasons other than poor prognosis or the cost of treatment but rather because of burden of treatment The burden of treatment is so great for many women who ultimately decide to pursue other avenues such as adoption or living Based on the results of this study it is clear that there is a level of anxiety that is tolerable to be able to continue treatment through a successful IVF cycle Additional research is needed to uncover a potential threshold of acceptable anxiety as well mediating and moderating factors that contribute to the experience of anxiety during the process of infertility treatment Regardless the evidence supports that despite the threshold women who have only been treated with ovulation induction medications still have increases in anxiety about the resulting pregnancy following IVF This is an important consideration for those caring for women who become pregnant via IVF as these patients may require additional emotional support during treatment It has been suggested in the literature that patients who have IVF have their care experience improved by minimizing the burden associated with the process First patient vulnerability to anxiety and other negative psychosocial experiences can be improved with screening for psychological distress at the start of treatment and when indicated appropriate referral for support Additionally staff caring for women can reduce the potential for negative interactions with increased staff training about issues in communication interaction skills promoting shared decision making This study had limitations that should be acknowledged While current trends in clinical care support the notion that women have been treated with an ovulation induction medication such as clomiphene citrate prior to comprehensive evaluation with the RE the study would have benefited from ascertaining the specific diagnosis of women reporting their anxiety and therefore could have been incorporated into the data analysis thus strengthening the findings Also capturing the number of less invasive treatment cycles subjects had prior to utilizing IVF would help to add dimension to the understanding of this phenomena Finally as anxiety has been shown to fluctuate throughout pregnancy measuring this variable over multiple time points would allow for elucidation of how women who are pregnant via IVF experience pregnancy anxiety more comprehensively Conclusion This study showed that the impact of previous less invasive infertility treatments prior to a successful IVF cycle was associated with increased anxiety in the resulting pregnancy and women who had a history of stimulated only cycles i e clomiphene citrate and previous to their successful IVF had more anxiety during their pregnancy conceived via IVF than those who had more complex previous treatment which included IUI or without or no treatment at all The understanding of the fact that the women who had only been previously treated with ovulation inducing medications without IUI helps understand the patient care experience such that better identification of those at risk for increased anxiety in pregnancy can be made and an appropriate clinical response can be made for women who are experiencing increases in anxiety Conflict of Interest Authors declare no conflict of

normal XY males and in the rare XX males and it is absent in normal XX females and many XY females There are several methods which can indicate a male genotype by the presence of the amplified product of SRY gene The aim of this study was to identify the SRY gene for embryo sex determination in human during pregnancy using loop mediated isothermal amplification method Methods A total of blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected and Plasma DNA was extracted LAMP assay was performed using DNA obtained for detection of SRY gene Furthermore colorimetric LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of SRY gene was developed Results LAMP results revealed that the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes A total of blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos and eight female embryos All used visual components in the colorimetric assay could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones Conclusion The LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable tool capable of monitoring the purity and detection of SRY gene for sex determination Detection dyes Embryo sexing LAMP assay Pregnancy Sex determination analysis SRY gene Introduction Molecular mechanisms of sex determination involve a growing network of genes a large number which are transcription factors The transcription factors so far are identified as having a major role in sex determination In humans the gene for the factor resides on the short arm of the Y chromosome Individuals who are born with the short arm but not the long arm of the Y chromosome are male while individuals born with the long arm of the Y chromosome but not the short arm are female By analyzing the DNA of rare XX men and XY women the position of the gene has been narrowed down to a region of the Y chromosome located near the tip of the short arm In this region a DNA sequence was found that could encode a peptide of amino acids This peptide is probably a transcription factor since it contains a domain called the HMG box This domain is found in several transcription factors and chromatin proteins and it induces bending in the region of DNA to which it binds This gene is called SRY region of the Y and there is extensive evidence that it is indeed the gene that encodes the human factor Methods for sex determination using PCR for amplification of SRY gene have also been reported These methods can indicate a male genotype by the presence of the amplified product of SRY gene Nonetheless the need for trained staff operating space equipment and reagents has impeded its usefulness Hence there has been an increasing demand for simple and molecular tests Loop mediated isothermal amplification a novel nucleic acid amplification method that relies on an strand displacement DNA synthesis is performed by Bst DNA polymerase Four or six primers that identify six or eight distinct regions are used in this method It is operated under a constant temperature to C and it eliminates the need for specialized thermal cycler equipment An important advantage of LAMP is its ability to amplify specific sequences of DNA under isothermal conditions Detection of amplification product can be determined via turbidity caused by an increasing quantity of the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate in solution LAMP positive amplicons have been confirmed by adding a number of fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye including ethidium bromide and SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II after the reaction is completed or metal indicators such as magnesium sulphate calcium chloride SYBR Green I propidium iodide GeneFinder TM calcein hydroxynaphthol blue phenol red and TM prior to the reaction allowing observation with the naked eye The purpose of this study was to establish a rapid sensitive specific and easy method to detect SRY gene using a visualized detection system Methods Sample collection and plasma DNA extraction A total of blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected Another set of blood samples from women and men were also obtained using them as plasma negative and positive controls for the study respectively Fresh blood samples were drawn into Vacutainer EDTA tubes Cat immediately and were centrifuged at rpm for min in a refrigerated their plasma fractions were collected and stored at C for further analysis Plasma DNA was extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit Cat by following protocol Briefly ml of plasma was mixed with proteinase K ml on ACL buffer by for min in a ml conical tube Then the mixture was incubated in a C water bath for min Then ml ACB buffer was added to the sample lysate and mixed by for min incubated for min on ice and applied to the QIAamp mini column Following the multiple wash and centrifugation steps columns were incubated for min at C and DNA was eluted with of AVE buffer and stored at C for further analyses The extraction quality of nucleic acid was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis The nucleic acid was stained with ethidium bromide The purity of DNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance values at nm and nm using spectrophotometer Amplification of SRY gene using LAMP By means of the Primer Explorer V software for specific primers were designed based on SRY genes accession Table Figure shows the schematic position of LAMP primers within SRY gene A basic set of four primers was needed including FIP Inner BIP Inner Outer and Outer to identify six distinct regions on the target DNA To accelerate the LAMP reaction two additional primers i e LF Forward and LB Backward were also used FIP consisted of the complementary sequence of a linker and BIP consisted of a linker and the complementary sequence of Primers and were located outside and regions while loop primers LF and LB were located between and and between and respectively Finally the primers were tested for similarities with other sequences available in the GenBank databases using the BLASTN algorithm LAMP assay was separately performed in a total volume of using DNA obtained in a way described before using designed primers in pregnant women women and men samples Initially DNA was added to of LAMP mixture to provide a final concentration of mM supplied buffer buffer containing mM mM KCl SO mM Triton mM Betaine mM MgSO mM dNTP of primer and of primer LF and LB of primer FIP and BIP and U of Bst DNA polymerase England Biolabs Tubes were then

added to the LAMP reaction as described previously Prior to amplification magnesium sulphate mM MgSO of GeneFinder TM to with Bio of SYBR Green I to with of the hydroxynaphthol blue dye mM Lemongreen Shanghai of phenol red to with Chemie or of the GelRed TM dye were separately added from a stock solution to the master mix After amplification ethidium bromide and SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II Takara Bio Co Ltd were added to LAMP reaction separately The tubes containing MgSO GeneFinder TM SYBR Green I HNB and phenol red dyes were easily monitored for color change by simply looking at them in daylight while the ones containing GelRed TM ethidium bromide and SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II were examined under UV light nm after a short vortex Results DNA isolation DNA must be purified from cellular material in such a manner to prevent degradation The absorbance ratios of DNA samples were found to be in range of indicating the purity of DNA Figure LAMP assay The initial optimization of the assay was conducted using a set of four basic primers and optimal concentrations were determined The reaction mixture was incubated at temperatures ranging from to C The optimal temperature was found to be C for min Values and concentrations of other components of the reaction were optimized After detection of LAMP by gel electrophoresis the smeared bands of amplified product indicated the positive reaction Figure Our results revealed the positive reaction was highly specific only with fresh blood samples containing XY chromosomes while no amplification was found in blood samples containing XX chromosomes Our new LAMP protocol could successfully identify positive samples and positive control LAMP amplicons were electrophoresed and a large number of fragments ladder like were eventually visualized As shown in figure typical ladder pattern of the amplified LAMP products with agarose gel electrophoresis was only observed for the positive samples and positive control The LAMP assay showed no detectable amplification of other samples including the negative control and negative samples A total of blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos and eight female embryos The authenticity of the results by the follow up was performed after delivery and finally the diagnosis of gender in pregnant women was determined by plasma LAMP method Figure A Gel electrophoresis

the solutions In this regard all used visual components could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones Figure It is noticeable that positive results by MgSO TM SYBR Green I HNB phenol red TM ethidium bromide and SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II were turbidity green green sky blue red orange yellow and green respectively Discussion The LAMP method generally had the following advantages over the other methods such as easy detection high sensitivity high efficiency simple manipulation safety low cost and being user friendly In reality except for section one which takes equal time and LAMP overall requires just min to accomplish the least demanding detection This in turn would simplify the detection procedure and result in saving significant time needed for separating the amplified products on the gel and analyzing the data which are commonly used in other methods including nested PCR reverse transcription PCR multiplex PCR and immunocapture PCR Such visual methods not only involve some expensive instruments but also during a period of time exposure to the UV light it is harmful to the eyes even watching for a short period would irritate the eyes and cause symptoms similar to as well as ethidium bromide could induce a number of serious negative effects on researchers who use these methods More surprisingly in LAMP amplified products can be easily visualized by means of different color indicators with no essential requirement of additional staining thus toxic staining materials would be significantly avoided Simple cost effective and user friendly equipped labs with some molecular instruments as well as trained personnel are prerequisites to perform PCR assays On the contrary LAMP can be easily accomplished just in a water bath or temperature block with no need of thermocycler and gel electrophoresis as the same results were recorded by other researchers Likewise exclusive of the primer designing process which is somehow complicated and sensitive other phases are simply applicable On the other hand the presence of LAMP positive amplicons proved to be confirmed by adding a number of fluorescent or metal dyes to the reaction tubes allowing observation with the naked eye In the current study therefore LAMP amplified products were confirmed by adding all aforementioned visual systems either prior to or after the reaction along with forming diverse color patterns depending upon the chemical characteristics of the applied chemical substances as dye According to our results despite the precise detection of positive LAMP products using all dyes some were significantly superior when the time of stability cost and the safety were taken into consideration Table For instance regardless of its reasonable color change stability when employing ethidium bromide a UV transilluminator must be both of them are toxic resulting in deleterious consequences on human health and the environment More interestingly in some cases just a little fluorescent emission could be observed in negative tubes presumably arising from the presence of primers and or DNA templates leading to an increase in results Alternative to such problems the first metal dye called magnesium sulphate was utilized but just an ephemeral color change i e no more than a few was observed as the same result was reported Even though short stability of the color change probably cannot be a significant problem as long as just a few numbers of suspicious samples are used during assessment of a great quantity of infected samples most of the time inaccurate results will be accordingly achieved The method nevertheless could be thereby attributed as a reliable visual observation approach since on the one hand it is exploited prior to the reaction and on the other hand there is no need for toxic devices Anyway to provide a situation to increase time stability the second fluorescent dye SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II was employed leading to a clear green color pattern Notably regardless of observing a significant growth on time stability the method not only requires UV transilluminator but also its stability is more negatively sensitive Indeed since the dye must be added after the amplification as it requires opening of the tubes the occurrence of risk will be accordingly enhanced To avoid such contaminations using separate rooms can be a solution for LAMP setup and analysis More recently it has also been pointed out that the visualized LAMP assay demands a high concentration of SYBR Green I which will hamper the LAMP reaction if it is added before LAMP reaction so the LAMP detection based on SYBR Green I might be difficult To abbreviate the contamination hazard and also increase color stability as a result two additional metal indicators i e HNB and GeneFinder TM known as LAMP detection were lastly used Interestingly among several different visual dyes to accurately detect LAMP products both HNB and GeneFinder TM could produce long stable color change and brightness in a close approach to prevent risk as the best alternatives Two additional metal indicators red and GelRed TM were added before LAMP reaction but UV transilluminator was required Meanwhile the visual inspection of LAMP products by means of HNB and GeneFinder TM metal dyes was seen as advantageous as there was no need for electrophoresis and subsequent staining with carcinogenic ethidium bromide Lastly the color brightness and stability of both HNB and GeneFinder TM in the solutions with positive negative reactions remained constant after weeks of exposure to ambient light whereas turbidity caused by precipitation of MgSO or SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II was stable for only s and days respectively which were in agreement with the results reported by previous researchers However the results obtained here represent those achievable in the research laboratory setting and it is uncertain whether these results also apply to actual specimens compared with other LAMP assays Table Table Comparison of colorimetric assays for detection of SRY gene Visual system Detection method Safety Positive reaction Negative

Conclusion In conclusion sex determination using detection of SRY gene by LAMP method in fresh human blood shows the smear and or ladder band only in male blood samples but not in female samples The LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable tool capable of helping in monitoring the purity and identification of SRY gene for sex determination LAMP method all in all had the following

responsible for most cases of localized gestational trophoblastic neoplasia Gestational trophoblastic disease describes a number of gynecologic tumors that originate in trophoblastic layer including hydatidiform mole or invasive mole choriocarcinoma placental site trophoblastic tumor and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor Invasive mole may arise from any pregnancy event although in most cases is diagnosed after molar pregnancy Overall cure rate in low risk patients is nearly and in patient In rare cases molar tissue traverses thickness of myometrium and leads to perforation and acute abdomen and invasive mole infrequently metastasis The best treatment option is chemotherapy to stage and score with single or multiple and in patients that fertility is not the matter hysterectomy can be done Case Presentation A years old woman referred to Firouzgar hospital months after curettage of molar pregnancy with vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen In workup HCG mIU ml and evidence of metastasis was detected Chemotherapy due to stage and score and surgery due to acute abdomen was done This case was reported for its rarity Discussion This case reported about ovarian metastasis and uterine rupture with acute abdomen and involvement of omentum in metastatic invasive mole Lack of surveillance led to extensive morbidity Management of this patient was successful In follow up she was free of disease without sequel of any kind for five years now Complete mole Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia Haemoperitoneum Invasive mole Trophoblast Introduction Invasive mole is penetration of molar tissue or partial into myometrium or uterine vasculature Edematous villus and proliferative trophoblasts invade myometrium so they can be distinguished from choriocarcinoma Pathologists mention the existence of villi in trophoblastic tissue Locally invasive gestational trophoblastic neoplasia develops in of patients and metastatic form in of patients after evacuation of complete mole and infrequently after partial mole HCG level mIU ml excessive uterine enlargement theca lutein cyst size cm are considered as high risks for developing post molar tumors risk The most common symptom of invasive mole is persistent vaginal bleeding after evacuation of molar pregnancy involution of uterus and persistent theca lutein cyst is another The rise in titer is a laboratory test for diagnosis of invasive mole in follow up of molar pregnancy Although definite diagnosis of invasive mole is based on pathology with or radiologic diagnosis invasive mole is diagnosed as well In rare cases metastasis occurred and the most common sites were lungs vagina pelvis liver brain bowel and kidney and spleen were other metastatic sites However metastasis to ovary from invasive mole is rare About to of ovarian tumors come from metastasis of other organs Metastasis can occur from direct extension of another pelvic neoplasm or by hematogenous or lymphatic spread or by transcelomic dissemination Possibility of metastasis to ovary is extremely rare which is even much lower than that of nongestational primary ovary choriocarcinoma with an incidence of in Ovarian non gestational choriocarcinoma is a major differential diagnosis Metastasis to the omentum is very rare in invasive mole Invasive mole is curable with chemotherapy but hysterectomy decreases the need for multiple courses of chemotherapy and in patients with heavy bleeding or sepsis for control of complication and stabilization chemotherapy is needed Here a case with invasive mole after evacuation of molar pregnancy presented with acute abdomen and in surgery metastasis to ovary and omentum and parametrium was detected Management and treatment with hysterectomy and chemotherapy in this case was successful Case Presentation A old housewife woman gravid para live child with a last years old child referred to Firouzgar hospital on August with a history of a dilation and curettage and months of cough On examination she was febrile C tachycardia leukocytosis and uterus was tender and enlarged Primary management of her problem was carried out in another hospital Vaginal bleeding persisted and second curettage was done in another hospital At that time chest was normal In our hospital report of sample pathology given from first and second curettage was complete mole After molar evacuation the patient was not monitored for weekly determination of level She received antibiotics to and work up for malignant trophoblastic disease or persistent GTN was done because of high level mIU ml and much too enlarged uterus and involvement of the whole uterine parenchyma which was detected on sonography tumor size in uterus was cm The liver and renal function tests were also normal Thyroid function test demonstrated hyperthyroidism In the metastatic work up CT scan of chest and abdomen and brain was carried out CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed involvement of the left adnexa and pelvic lymphadenopathy The chest CT scan showed multiple bilateral round pulmonary metastatic lesions that were cm in diameter illustrated in figure The liver and brain scans were both normal Figure Pulmonary Metastasis in invasive mole Once the disease was diagnosed the patient chemotherapy with EMA started Table Because of acute abdomen and severe abdominal pain and unstable vital signs with diagnosis of perforative peritonitis the patient was taken up for emergency laparotomy Due to hyperthyroid state in induction of anesthesia blocker agent was administered In this patient subtotal hysterectomy and left salpingo oophorectomy and resection of omentum were done In gross uterus chorionic villus was seen Uterine wall was perforated by tumoral invasion on the left side of posterior wall Figure Figure Enlarged uterus ovarian metastasis perforation of uterus and myometrium invasion Table The patient was III according to FIGO staging and WHO scoring Age Antecedent pregnancy mole abortion Term Interval months from index pregnancy Pretreatment HCG serum mIU ml Largest tumor size cm Site of metastasis lung Kidney spleen GI Liver brain Number of metastasis Previous failed chemotherapy Single drug Two or more drugs The bilateral uterine parameters the external surface of the endocervical canal and the omentum were invaded by tumors A hemorrhagic luteal cyst was seen in the right ovary The left ovary was totally invaded by tumors Final diagnosis was invasive mole Figures and Figure Villous formation in myometrium Figure Villosity with necrosis in invasive mole This patient was treated with courses of chemotherapy with After negative she received an additional courses of chemotherapy to reduce the relapse titer was later tested monthly year When the first year of testing terminated HCG testing on a bimonthly basis for years was done The patient was followed up to years and after that the patient was free of tumor and the was negative Discussion Invasive mole with rupture of uterus and metastasis to ovary and omentum and manifestation of acute abdomen was rare According to epidemiological retrospective survey invasive mole secondary to hydatidiform mole occurred in six months after evacuation Local invasion in the uterus occurred in about of cases Overall invasive mole occurred in pregnancies Partial and complete hydatidiform mole are distinct disease processes with characteristic cytogenetic histologic and clinical features Kumar et al in reported a case of invasive mole presenting as acute hemoperitoneum that was similar to the present case In invasive mole proliferation of trophoblast in stroma was seen Molar tissue can penetrate myometrium and lead to uterine perforation and cause vaginal bleeding due to erosion of uterine vessels Similar to Atala et al case report in in our case uterine perforation with acute intra peritoneal hemorrhage was seen Due to ease of entry of molar tissue into large venous lake present in myometrium and pelvis in pregnancy or trophoblastic disease metastasis of invasive mole commonly in lungs and after lungs in vagina cervix broad ligament in our case metastasis to lung and ovary and omentum was seen Although theca lutein cysts in mole due to high serum HCG level are seen normally they regress spontaneously within months Non gestational choriocarcinoma of ovary is differential diagnosis but due to occurrence of metastasis to ovary in our case after molar pregnancy this differential diagnosis was not a matter As in a report of invasive mole in fallopian tube the first misdiagnosis of our case in another hospital repeat curettage was done although the first diagnosis could be persistent GTN In another case report from Bruner similarity with our case was seen Invasive mole is highly sensitive to chemotherapy Combination chemotherapy should be continued in such cases as far as toxicity permits until the patient achieves consecutive normal HCG levels As normal HCG levels are attained additional courses of chemotherapy are administered to reduce the risk of relapse In low risk patients one or two courses are adequate In our case courses of chemotherapy after normalization of were done Hysterectomy may be required in invasive mole in order to control vaginal bleeding and in unstable patient or in sepsis Hysterectomy is a reasonable option for patients who do not wish to preserve their fertility but it does not prevent metastasis Furthermore in patients with extensive uterine tumor hysterectomy may substantially reduce the trophoblastic tumor burden and thereby limit the need for multiple courses of chemotherapy In our case due to unstable and uterine rupture hysterectomy was done but the need for chemotherapy courses was not removed and after several courses of chemotherapy with courses it was cured However final diagnosis of our patient was invasive mole with metastasis to ovary and omentum and lung and uterine rupture The patient responded to the treatment well and in follow up this patient was still fine for years after definite care for metastasis invasive mole with surgery and chemotherapy Conclusion An invasive mole in uterus with ovarian and omental metastasis was diagnosed and the patient was successfully treated by hysterectomy and chemotherapy and she was fine for years in follow up Conflict of Interest Authors declare no conflict of

this study a comparative genome analysis of Pantoea genomes was conducted Two vertical genetic arsC genes without any contribution to As resistance were found to exist in the Pantoea strains Besides the two arsC genes As resistance gene clusters arsRBC or arsRBCH were found in Pantoea genomes These ars clusters were found to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer from sources related to Franconibacter helveticus Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii During the history of evolution the ars clusters were acquired more than once in some species and were lost in some strains producing strains without As resistance capability This study revealed the organization distribution and the complex evolutionary history of As resistance genes in Pantoea spp The insights gained in this study improved our understanding on the As resistance strategy of Pantoea spp and its roles in the biogeochemical cycling of As comparative genomic arsenic Pantoea spp arsenic resistance ars genes Introduction Arsenic one of the earliest known toxic elements occurs naturally worldwide Smith et al To adapt to habitats with elevated As microbes have evolved dynamic resistance mechanisms The most ubiquitous and important strategy of As resistance is to reduce to and extrude it using ars operons with various genomic configurations in specific bacterial strains et al The core genes of ars systems however are arsR the transcriptional repressor arsB the arsenite efflux pump and arsC arsenate reductase Xu et al Besides this detoxification mechanism using ars systems some strains possess the mechanism of As changing inorganic As into organic forms using a distinct gene arsM Qin et al Zhao et al Some strains are able to oxidize to which involve proteins AoxAB Levin and Tal Ghosh et al Some strains are able to reduce to with ArrAB as part of their respiratory processes transferring electrons to As and producing the energy for strains Saltikov and Newman The reported genes related to the strategy of As resistance are listed in Table Table Genes involved in arsenic resistance and transformation Function Gene Protein Arsenate reduction arsR Transcriptional regulator ArsR arsB efflux

molecular biology research As resistance traits are revealed primarily based on the cultivation of a specific strain and it is impossible to study the As strategy of all strains in a genus Nevertheless understanding of such traits in all strains of a genus is sometime more desirable Gaining this knowledge is no longer a challenge with the explosive development of sequencing technology The genomic sequence of a strain contains nearly all of the genetic information Therefore fundamental knowledge such as the phylogenetic the genetic traits of As resistance and its evolutionary history can be obtained through comparative genomic analysis et al Colston et al So here we use genomic information of Pantoea spp and compared these genomes to explore and predict the strategy of As resistance and their evolutionary patterns in genus Pantoea as an example Pantoea is a genus of facultative anaerobic bacteria This genus belongs to gamma Proteobacteria family Gammaproteobacteria and was recently separated from the genus Enterobacter Gavini et al Currently the genus contains species Members of this genus are found in various environmental matrices Meng et al Zhang and Birch Rezzonico et al In the strain Pantoea sp IMH was an isolate that reported firstly as the strain having the As resistance capability within Pantoea species Wu et al Further we sequenced the genome of Pantoea sp IMH and found two ars clusters and to its As resistance Tian and Jing Wang et al However the evolutionary history and genetic traits of As resistance in genus Pantoea are not fully understood Herein we present the first study of the genetic traits of As resistance in Pantoea spp as well as their evolutionary history Two vertically transmitted arsC genes without any contribution to As resistance were found to exist in the Pantoea strains Besides these two arsC genes As resistance gene clusters arsRBC or arsRBCH were found in Pantoea genomes These ars clusters were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from sources related to Franconibacter helveticus Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii The insights gained in this study improve our understanding on the complex evolutionary history of As resistance genes and their roles in the biogeochemical cycling of As Materials and Methods Phylogenetic Analysis Phylogenetic trees of Pantoea species were constructed based on core proteins shared by Pantoea genomes and the genome of Tatumella sp NML according to the following three methods maximum likelihood neighbor joining and Bayesian inference ML and NJ trees were computed by applying models with bootstrap replicates and uniform rates in Tamura Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were carried out by ClustalW and the CONSEL program was used to select the best model of the trees Shimodaira and Hasegawa Thompson et al The BI tree was generated using the MrBayes package with mixed models Ronquist et al The NJ tree of concatenated arsRBC homologs was generated according to the same method described above or FigTree v was used to illustrate the constructed trees Average Nucleotide Identity Assembled contigs were reconstituted from the GenBank files for genomes by using the seqret function of the EMBOSS package Rice et al These genomes were treated in the same manner to ensure that any biases were consistent across the entire dataset was used to analyze these contig sets for the ANI and tetramer usage patterns using default parameters Richter and Comparative Genomics All of the orthologous pairs between Pantoea test genomes were identified by Pan Genome Analysis Pipeline Zhao et al The common dataset of shared genes among test strains was defined as their core genome The total set of genes with test genomes was defined as the pan genome The set of genes in each strain not shared with other strains was defined as the unique genes The details of the strains used are listed in Supplementary Table Construction of the Recombinant Plasmids and Escherichia coli Strains A kb Bam Xba I DNA fragment containing the complete cluster of Pantoea stewartii region bp upstream of the start codon ATG of arsR the contiguous four genes and bp upstream of the start codon ATG of arsH was PCR amplified with primers and Table A kb Bam Xba I DNA fragment containing the complete gene cluster of P agglomerans bp region downstream of the stop

of P stewartii region bp upstream of the start codon ATG of gene and bp downstream of the stop codon TTA of was PCR amplified with primers and Table The above PCR products were ligated to the Bam Xba I site of plasmid yielding plasmids and Then the plasmids were transferred to E coli yielding the recombinant E coli E coli E coli and E coli strains respectively Strains Plasmids and Culture Conditions The strains and plasmids used in this work are summarized in Supplementary Table E coli and Pantoea strains were grown in LB medium liter contains g tryptone g yeast and g or LB plates medium with w v at When appropriate antibiotics were added at the following concentration mL ampicillin Resistance to As species was tested by plating serial dilutions of cultures of each strain onto agar plates containing filtered sodium arsenate AsO Results Genomic Features To date species have been reported in genus Pantoea and strains of nine species P ananatis P agglomerans P stewartii P vagans P dispersa P septica P rodasii P rwandensis and P anthophila have been sequenced To study the genetic traits and phylogenetic history of As resistance in genus Pantoea strains were chosen containing two to three standard strains sequenced in each species and five unidentified strains Table A summary of features for these sequenced genomes is listed in Supplementary Table The contents of the genomes range from to These genomes vary in size by approximately in average from to with coding sequence numbers ranging from to indicating a substantial variation and Core Genes To reveal the genomic features specific to each strain we identified all orthologous pairs between the tested Pantoea genomes using PGAP Our analysis of the total of genomes revealed that a pan genome contains putative genes in the genus Pantoea Out of these genes were represented in the specific genomes of Pantoea spp suggesting some frequency of horizontal gene acquisition from other taxa The number of specific genes ranges from to with the smallest encoded by P vagans and the largest identified in P agglomerans Figure The cluster of orthologous groups assignments reveal that a higher proportion of genes in most of the strains can be assigned to the K L and M wall membrane envelope categories Figure In contrast to the the core genome of Pantoea spp contains putative genes which represents of the repertoire of protein coding genes of each strain illustrating a small degree of genomic diversity in this group of bacteria Figure The genomic analysis agrees with the fact that Pantoea strains are consistent in morphological and physiological appearance Furthermore the COG assignment results show that these core genes are in different functional categories Figure In fact the percentage of genes in each functional category remains rather similar an average divergence of This is consistent with an earlier report that larger prokaryotic genomes preferentially accumulate genes directly or indirectly involved in metabolism Konstantinidis and Tiedje These genes support a broader metabolic diversity which in turn would improve the ecological success of Pantoea under more diverse environmental conditions Phylogenic Analyses To associate the distribution of As resistance genes in Pantoea spp with their phylogenetic affiliation we constructed the phylogeny tree of the Pantoea spp based on rRNA gene sequences using NJ methods rooted by Tatumella sp NML Figure This phylogenetic tree showed that the strains in the same species reported were grouped together except strain At the same time we constructed the phylogeny of the genomes based on concatenation of the core genes that are present as single copies in a genome using the ML method and rooted by Tatumella sp NML Figure The phylogenetic trees inferred using BI and NJ methods Figures were congruent with the ML phylogenetic tree These trees show that some strains in different species reported were grouped together such as and and The phylogeny based on the core genes that are present as single copies in a genome showed a good correlation with that of rRNA gene sequences except for three strains and These results suggested that there were mistakes in the classification of Pantoea spp Further identification of the phylogenetic status of these strains was carried out as follows FIGURE Phylogenetic relationship of Pantoea strains Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed based on core proteins shared by genomes and an Tatumella sp NML The information gained from the phylogenetic analysis provides an important depiction of the evolutionary relationship between different strains but it does not translate directly into the overall similarity of the genomes which is usually determined through the hybridization Herein ANI approach was used to overcome the difficulty of conventional DDH in evaluating the genomic similarity of bacteria Richter and The ANI results justified the conclusion of phylogenetic analysis As shown in Figure strains were classified into species based on their ANI For examples and resulted in a higher ANI suggesting that they belong to the same species P ananatis Strain and resulted in a higher ANI suggesting that they belong to the same species P vagans It was noteworthy that Panotea sp IMH represented a novel species for the ANI between IMH and other strains FIGURE Average Nucleotide Identity based on whole genome alignments ANI values are colored red according to historical species cutoff value Strains in one species are marked out the same color Strains and which grouped together were identified as strains of P agglomerans Meanwhile this result confirms the synonymy of P and PVAG P vagans and suggests that is not a member of species P agglomerans In agreement with the phylogenetic analysis our ANI results indicate that there are mistakes in the classification of strain and This was also reported in other genus and generally corrected with the advance in technology Goris et al To associate the distribution of genes with their phylogenetic affiliation in this article below we renamed strain to P reagglomerans P agglomerans to P septica P vagans to P agglomerans P ananatis and to P agglomerans P vagans Distribution and Organization of Genes in Pantoea Genomes Only As resistance genes ars including arsR arsB arsC and arsH were detected in most Pantoea genomes Table and Figure The arsC gene encoding arsenate reductase is involved in the transformation of to which is then excreted by the As efflux pump ArsB encoded by the arsB gene Nevertheless aio arr and arsM were not found in Pantoea genomes suggesting that cytoplasmic reduction and extrusion are the As resistance strategy used in genus Pantoea spp This mechanism benefits the bacteria itself though it enhances the toxicity to the surrounding environment FIGURE Distribution and organization of ars genes and arsC genes in Pantoea strains arsC arsB arsR arsH and arsC genes are marked with different colors There are only arsC genes in I or in II or in III and both and in IV The ars genes in a genome are prone to group together as ars clusters arsRBC and arsRBCH Although comparison of the COG assignments of genomes revealed that the DNA sequences between homologous genes within these ars clusters are conserved some variations exist in DNA sequences which can be divided into two and Figure Unlike the two ars clusters in Pantoea sp IMH only one ars cluster either or was observed in other strains Table and Figure The ars gene clusters generally exhibited more than identity within each and about identity between two Actually the ars clusters were not detected in eight strains including and Moreover two arsC genes with only homology and were found in the genomes Based on the different ars genes distributions the strains were categorized into four and discussed as follows The overall distribution and organization of As resistance genes in Pantoea strains are summarized in Figure Evolution and the Origin of ars Clusters The distribution and organization of ars genes in Pantoea raise a question as to their evolution The deviant content is used as a detect method of HGT Ochman et al Xie et al We detected the content of ars clusters and their corresponding genomes The results showed that the contents of the clusters are higher than those of the genomes in Pantoea strains vs except P septica P vagans and P dispersa the contents of the clusters are lower than those of the genomes in Pantoea strains vs showing variation of content between clusters and the corresponding genomes These results indicated that these ars clusters may be acquired in Pantoea strains by HGT Table and Figure To further elucidate the evolution of the ars gene clusters we compared the chromosomal regions flanking the ars gene clusters among the Pantoea strains and found that the genes in the upstream and downstream regions were conserved among strains of the same species Figure For example the DNA polymerase V subunit UmuC gene and adenosine deaminase gene in the upstream and transcriptional regulator gene and ATPase P gene in the downstream are conserved for the ars clusters in the strain and within the species P agglomerans strains The same species strains share the same insertion sites whereas the different strains result in different insertion sites suggesting that ars clusters may be acquired more than once FIGURE Synteny of the chromosomal regions flanking the ars gene cluster among each Interestingly as shown in Figure the flanking regions of the ars gene clusters in strain P stewartii and P stewartii were homologous to the corresponding regions of strain P stewartii the same phenomenon was found in strain P septica P vagans and P septica and strain P anthophila and Pantoea sp This result suggests that ars clusters may be lost in P stewartii P septica and Pantoea sp To gain insights into the origin of ars genes clusters in Pantoea a NJ phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the ArsRBC protein sequences As shown in Figure the strains possessing and clusters form separate groups Notably the phylogeny reveals that the and ars clusters of F helveticus were sister groups and grouped to ars clusters of S marcescens and C freundii These results imply that the cluster may be acquired via HGT from F helveticus and from S marcescens and C freundii in early evolutionary history FIGURE Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of the ArsRBC protein sequences derived from Pantoea spp strains and other representative species A total of bootstrap replicates was made and bootstrap values are indicated at each node cluster grouped together marked in red cluster formed in another group marked in blue Two arsC Genes in Pantoea Our studies reveal that two arsC genes and are found in the genomes with just homology Figure Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences formed distinct groups which were clearly divergent from conventional arsenate reductase Figure It was reported that and were four conserved residues of the ArsC protein in the process of arsenic resistance Gladysheva et al was identified as a catalytic residue and was activated by nearby residues and Martin et al Alignment analysis of a rsC and arsC genes shows that and residues were conserved but residues and in two proteins were not conserved Figure These results suggest that these two arsC genes are not involved in the As resistance FIGURE tree based on ArsC proteins ArsC sequences were derived from Pantoea strains and the representative microorganisms ArsC sequence of Bacillus subtilis was used as an out group To explore the evolution of these two arsC genes in Pantoea molecular phylogenetic analysis molecular conservation and linear representation analysis were used Rice and Lampson Nelson et al and Forterre Dagan et al The comparative analysis showed that the two arsC genes are conserved in all of the Figure Phylogenetic analysis showed that and genes were grouped together respectively Figure These results suggested that the two arsC genes evolved with a possible evolutionary scenario of that there is a common ancestor Further we compared the flanking regions of the two arsC genes Interestingly two genes in the upstream uracil phosphoribosyl transferase genes and uracil xanthine transporter and two genes in the downstream reduction protein DsrE and GntR family transcriptional regulator are conserved for genes The two genes in the upstream response regulator genes and multidrug efflux RND transporter permease and two genes in the downstream desuccinylase genes and membrane protein are also conserved for genes Figure This observation also suggests that and genes were the vertical genetic genes in the genus Pantoea Possibility they may have been the main As resistance contributors in early times and later had evolved with deviance Functional Analysis of ars Gene and arsC Genes To verify that the ars gene clusters are the contributors to the As resistance the cluster with its promoter from P stewartii a representative strain with the cluster and the cluster with its promoter from P agglomerans a representative strain with the cluster were PCR amplified and then ligated into vector and further transferred to E coli any As resistance The growth of the yielded recombinant E coli strains E and E was tested in mM concentration As shown in Figure both E and E survived in mM and E grew better than E This result suggests that both the and clusters enabled E coli to resist As and seemed to have a more effective As resistance capability than FIGURE The heterologous expression of and in E coli The and plasmids Table were transformed along with the empty vector in Escherichia coli E coli arsRBC as a control Serial dilutions of the strains were then plated on LB agar medium with mM Pictures were taken after h at To test the functions of and genes the like gene and gene with their promoters from P stewartii were PCR amplified and then ligated into vector and further transferred to E coli As shown in Figure neither the nor like gene enables E coli to resist As In line with the alignment result the function analysis demonstrates that these two arsC genes do not contribute to As resistance Discussion Pantoea is a genus with members identified by DDH a gold standard for prokaryotic species identification However DDH results may be irreproducible and vary depending on the reannealing temperature Gevers et al With the rapid development in technology and decline in sequencing cost promising new measurements such as ANI are being developed to evaluate the genomic similarity of bacteria Richter and In this study we identified the Pantoea spp phylogenetic status using ANI together with phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences of the core genes Figures Our results showed that strain and were misnamed We reclassified strain to P reagglomerans P agglomerans to P septica P vagans to P agglomerans P ananatis and to P agglomerans P vagans Our study provided data from genus Pantoea with a complex and controversial taxonomy and demonstrated the accuracy of a bioinformatics approach such as ANI to identify new species and to correct erroneous identifications from previous studies A previous study suggested that the ars system is a widespread As resistance mechanism et al Pantoea sp IMH was found to resist As by means of ars clusters arsRBC is located on the large universal Pantoea plasmids of four stains including P agglomerans P agglomerans P eucalypti and P anthophila Maayer et al This information leads to the hypothesis that plasmids may be involved in the evolution of As resistance mechanism by ars genes in Pantoea spp However there are untouched questions such as what are the mechanisms of the other Pantoea spp and what is the evolutionary history of genetic elements involved in the As resistance To answer these questions we collected the genome sequences of strains in nine species in NCBI P ananatis P agglomerans P stewartii P vagans P dispersa P septica P rodasii P rwandensis and P anthophila The sequencing results provided us with mass genomic information to detect the presence and the locations of genes in Pantoea spp Our study for the first time systematically analyzed the As resistance genes and revealed the As resistance traits in genus Pantoea Our research provided the definitive evidence that that As resistance strategy in Pantoea spp only involved the detoxification mechanism through ars clusters not the respiratory reduction mechanism through arr clusters This detoxification strategy was obtained by HGT This conclusion can likely to be extended to most bacteria We speculate that evolutionarily ancient microbes were exposed to As surroundings on ancient earth Oremland et al To overcome the selection pressure microbes evolved ars genes in their genomes for survival by HGT Therefore ars has very early origins and represents a widespread As resistance mechanism Two scattered arsC genes exist in each genome of the Pantoea strains but they exhibited no functional As resistance It is rare for arsC genes to show no As resistance capabilities Butcher et al Saltikov and Newman Compared to functional protein ArsC residues and of protein were variant Figure We speculate that in early times the ancestor of Pantoea spp evolved the arsC gene to resist As but later evolved with deviance during adaption to niches and thus retained arsC genes in some genomes The ars genes are abundant and tend to organize in typical arsRBC cluster structures Figure Apart from these operons arsRBCH operons are widely observed In genus Pantoea these kinds of structures were anticipated for these strains descended from a recent common ancestor Our study suggests that ars clusters may be acquired by HGT from F helveticus S marcescens and C freundii strains This is consistent with recent literature showing that bacterial As resistance and transformation was a trait acquired via HGT driven by adaptation to habitats containing As Cai et al et al Interestingly ars clusters are absent in some strains suggesting that some microbes may have lost their As resistance genes during adaption to niches In addition the number of As resistance genes in strains isolated from environments is much higher than in strains from other environments Macur et al Sutton et al Compared to the evolutionary pattern of ars operons Rosen the evolution of As resistance genes ars in Pantoea spp involves a mix of HGT and loss providing insight into the complex evolutionary history of As resistance Author Contributions LW and CJ conceived and

Several heavy metals are found in the Atacama Desert and microorganisms growing in this environment show varying levels of resistance tolerance to copper tellurium and arsenic among others Herein we report the genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of a new Exiguobacterium strain sp isolated from an altiplanic shallow athalassohaline lake Exiguobacterium sp belongs to the phylogenetic Group II and its closest relative is Exiguobacterium sp isolated from the Argentinian Altiplano average nucleotide Strain encodes a wide repertoire of proteins required for cadmium copper mercury tellurium chromium and arsenic resistance Of the Exiguobacterium genomes that were inspected only isolates and encode the arsenic efflux pump Strain was able to grow in up to mM arsenite and mM arsenate indicating that it is arsenic resistant Further expression of the ars operon and was strongly induced in response to both toxics suggesting that the arsenic efflux pump mediates arsenic resistance in Exiguobacterium sp Exiguobacterium polyextremophile stress comparative genomics Chilean Altiplano Nacional de y FONDECYT Introduction Extremophiles are microorganisms from all three domains of life Archaea and that grow in the most hostile environments found on Earth where they must withstand conditions including extreme pH temperature salinity pressure UV radiation and the presence of heavy metals or toxic compounds In some cases extremophiles face more than one extreme condition simultaneously and are called polyextremophiles Seufferheld et al Bowers et al et al Kurth et al To survive under extreme conditions microbes finely tune gene expression modulating the levels of proteins implicated in the response to stress et al Since their discovery extremophiles have attracted researchers because of their unique physiology ability to adapt to different environments and for their potential use in biotechnology Rothschild and Mancinelli The Andean Plateau region in West Central South America the Altiplano hosts a rich microbial diversity and remains an untapped resource for understanding the genetic diversity and distribution of polyextremophiles et al Andean Lakes are exposed to some of the highest levels of solar radiation on Earth et al Further water bodies found in the Altiplano e shallow lakes ponds streams etc are highly diverse showing different chemical compositions temperatures evaporation rates and depths among other conditions Together these factors drive the changing community structure of rich polyextreme microbiota that populates these lakes et al Dorador et al Cordero et al Despite these harsh conditions almost strains of prokaryotes cyanobacteria and and lower eukaryotes and have been isolated from bacterioplankton benthos microbial mats and soils surrounding HAALs Dib et al Flores et al et al Di Capua et al Lynch et al Bull and Asenjo Bull et al Microbial communities that evolved in HAALs tolerate a wide range of chemical and physical stresses including wide fluctuations in temperature low nutrient levels alkalinity and hypersalinity to Further high concentrations of heavy metals and metalloids especially arsenic to are found in HAALs primarily because of the geological foundation et al Zenoff et al Dib et al Farias et al et al Salar de Huasco is a saline wetland located at m above sea level in the Chilean Altiplano and is considered an athalassohaline system It exhibits typical conditions of the Altiplano low temperatures annual temperature low atmospheric pressure high solar radiation to Wm UVA radiation et al negative water balance and variable salinity ranging from freshwater to saturated salt waters Despite these conditions communities composed of microbial groups from all major branches of the microbial tree of life including Proteobacteria Cyanobacteria Bacteroidetes and Archaea thrive and grow in water bodies of the Salar de Huasco Dorador et al b Aguilar et al Molina et al It has been proposed that this exceptional microbial diversity results from species diversification caused by the adaptation of microorganisms to the constantly changing environment et al Consequently Salar de Huasco represents a potential reservoir of undescribed microbial diversity that could serve to study and identify novel mechanisms of stress resistance The Exiguobacterium genus Collins et al includes psychrotrophic mesophilic and moderate thermophilic species with variable morphologies rods double rods and that grow in a wide range of habitats including cold and hot environments with temperatures ranging from to Vishnivetskaya and Kathariou Vishnivetskaya et al Taxonomic and phylogenetic classification of the genus by rRNA gene sequence analysis shows that Exiguobacterium forms two distinct groups Group I includes strains isolated from cold or low temperature environments and Group II from hot springs or slightly alkaline and marine environments Vishnivetskaya et al One exception is Exiguobacterium sp which belongs to group II but was isolated from a glacier in Greenland Vishnivetskaya et al Members of the Exiguobacterium genus display traits that could be of biotechnological interest e g bioremediation and agriculture applications For example strains and can neutralize highly alkaline industry wastewater and remove pesticides respectively Lopez et al Kumar et al strain reduces arsenate to arsenite Anderson and Cook and other strains reduce chrome and mercury in a wide range of temperatures pH and salt concentrations Pattanapipitpaisal et al Petrova et al Okeke Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans shows high catalase activity in response to H O as a function of the growth phase and oxygen levels which could be used to remove peroxides used in the bleaching industry Takebe et al Exiguobacterium sp isolated from Laguna Socompa in the Argentinian altiplanic desert tolerates high arsenic concentrations Belfiore et al et al Further members of the Exiguobacterium genus are a source of enzymes that exhibit a broad range of thermal stability Usuda et al Suga and Koyama Hwang et al Hara et al Kasana and Yadav In the present study we aimed to understand the phylogenetic placement and to identify genetic determinants required for the response to stress in a new strain isolated from Salar de Huasco Exiguobacterium sp We investigated whether Exiguobacterium sp belongs to Group II and to what extent species from this genus share functional features based on the group to which they belong Additionally we searched the genomes of Exiguobacterium sp and other species for the presence of genes encoding proteins known to be involved in stress and metal resistance e g arsenic copper cadmium and oxidative and UV stress Finally we show that Exiguobacterium is resistant to arsenic which might be mediated at least in part by the arsenic efflux pump Materials and Methods Bacterial Growth Conditions and DNA Extraction Exiguobacterium sp was isolated from Salar de Huasco an altiplanic shallow saline wetland in the Atacama Desert Chile located between at an altitude of m Salinity of the sampling point was NaCl with mS cm of conductivity pH and at the sampling point Strain was grown for h at room temperature with shaking at rpm in L of YP culture media g L yeast extract g L Peptone and g L with a v v inoculum DNA extraction was performed with the AxyPrep Bacterial Genomic DNA miniprep kit following the instructions DNA quantity and quality was determined spectrophotometrically DNA Hybridization Assay To assess the relatedness of Exiguobacterium to the type strain Exiguobacterium aurantiacum DSM T we performed a hybridization assay in X SSC formamide medium at We evaluated the results per the recommendations of the ad hoc committee for the definition of bacterial species value of Wayne et al The assay was performed at the Leibniz Institute DSMZ German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Sequencing and Assembly Purified genomic DNA was used to construct two different types of sequencing libraries namely a from ng of fragmented DNA and a mate with of DNA fragmented by using the GS FLX Titanium Rapid Library GS FLX Titanium Rapid Library prep Adaptors and FastStart PCR System kits following the recommendations fragments size was between and An equimolar mix was then sequenced using the Roche FLX platform SFF files were separated into two FASTQ files one for each library type using utility from reads were trimmed at and all the resulting reads of bp were discarded Reads longer than the targeted length were clipped at the end so that only reads bp were used Mate reads were separated into two groups corresponding to each sequenced end of the fragment and ends reads of the sequenced and both groups were saved as backward sense reads Trimming was performed as described for reads Only those paired reads that conserved their mates were employed for the assembly The final number of reads obtained after this procedure was and mate and depth coverage with a read length average of bp after trimming internal adapters Assembly was performed using both mate paired and reads as in the Celera genome assembler version Myers et al unitigger BOG unitigger error ratio with the final parameter values by default The final assembly included contigs with a length of bp The Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ ENA GenBank under the accession The version described in this paper is Exiguobacterium Genomic Dataset All available genome sequences used in the analyses have been deposited in GenBank as of December numbers in Supplementary Table including a status of complete scaffolds or contigs The resulting genomes were organized into described species

to align the input sequences as implemented in pyANI Kurtz et al The average between any given pair was used as the final value Heat maps were generated using pheatmap V R package Kolde Genomic clusters were defined using hierarchical clustering based on a ANI threshold which represents a conservative boundary for genus species level classification Qin et al Pan Genome Analysis gene families were defined as gene clusters with at least sequence identity using three different methods triangle orthoMCL and bidirectional as implemented in v and Vinuesa The core genome was defined as the set of genes present in at least of the genomes Likewise the accessory genome set was defined as genes present in less than of genomes This analysis was performed at two levels the complete genome dataset and on each of the ANI clusters To gain insights into the functional potential of the accessory genome the core genome was subtracted from each of the genomes and annotated the remaining genes using Gene Ontology terms Ashburner et al All plots were generated in the R package Wickham Functional Analysis of the Core and Accessory Genomes The core and accessory genomes were separated for each of the six ANI clusters and GO terms were assigned to both sets Gene locus tags were used to map GO terms from the Pfam entries by annotated for each genome GO terms for each gene cluster was converted to their parent GO terms at the second level on a GO graph obo obtained from http geneontology org page The Gene Ontology Consortium Statistically significant functional terms between core and accessory genomes were determined by applying the test Results were also plotted with the R package Wickham Growth Curves Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Expression of Arsenic Resistance Genes Growth curve assays were performed to determine the ability of Exiguobacterium to grow at different concentrations of arsenite and arsenate Briefly a liquid culture of Exiguobacterium grown to an OD was diluted by adding liquid media supplemented with different concentrations of arsenic species AsIII and AsV HAsO until reaching an OD Growth was monitored in a microplate reader Infinite PRO at nm every min over a period MIC was determined from a bacterial culture grown in LB medium by taking a aliquot and diluting it with solutions of AsIII and AsV to final concentrations of mM and mM respectively final Then samples were incubated at for h with constant agitation and the OD was measured in a TECAN Infinite PRO Nanoquant Finally to determine the relative expression of genes known to be involved in arsenic resistance and present in Exiguobacterium the transcript levels of arsB arsR arsC and were quantified by Exiguobacterium was grown in LB medium at with constant agitation until reaching an OD of The culture was divided into three fractions control mM NaAsO and mM Na HAsO and incubated for min RNA extraction was carried out using the Phenol Chloroform method and RNA integrity was monitored using agarose electrophoresis cDNA was synthesized using the Reverse Transcriptase kit and Random Primer oligonucleotides hexamers TM The PCR reaction was carried out as follows min at followed by amplification cycles s and a final step of s and using primers specific for each gene in Supplementary Table Transcript levels were quantified using the Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master mix kit on a Stratagene thermal cycler Relative expression was normalized using rRNA gene expression levels Pfaffl Modeling and Alignment of Structural modeling and visualization of from strains and strains was performed using iterative threading assembly refinement Yang et al Results Strain showed a similarity at the rRNA gene sequence with Exiguobacterium aurantiacum DSM and Exiguobacterium sp and was classified as a member of the Exiguobacterium genus However an in vitro hybridization assay revealed that does not belong to the same species than E aurantiacum DSM threshold is for Wayne et al Goris et al Genome Assembly and Nucleotide Identity Analysis Exiguobacterium genomes range from to Mb in length with an average GC content of The genome of Exiguobacterium sp strain resulted in contigs totaling Mb in length with a GC content of In agreement with what was found in other isolates coding sequences including hypothetical ribosomal RNA genes and transference RNA genes were

very distinct and is most similar to isolate Exiguobacterium To understand the overall genetic similarity of strain with members of the Exiguobacterium genus an ANI analysis was conducted Konstantinidis and Tiedje b Goris et al Richter and against other publicly available Exiguobacterium genomes Table The analysis revealed distinct genomic clusters and that strain was the most similar isolate to with a ANI Figure suggesting that they belong to the same species according to the classification defined by Goris et al Strain was isolated from a stromatolite sample of Lake Socompa in the Argentinian Altiplano an environment with similar conditions to Salar de Huasco Cabrol et al et al et al In general as previously reported Vishnivetskaya et al isolates tended to cluster by habitat i e strains isolated from cold environments were more similar to each other than to strains isolated from marine alkaline temperate environments and vice versa Using the proposed boundaries for species delimitation i e ANI Varghese et al clusters were recognized Because at a ANI clusters were mostly composed of singletons we used a more conservative estimate for species genus boundary Using a ANI value six clusters were obtained cluster I E strain E indicum E enclensis E strain E strain leaf E acetylicum DSM E strain E indicum E acetylicum E strain E strain and E strain leaf

strain E strain E alkaliphilum and E strain cluster V E strain and E strain cluster VI E mexicanum HUD E pavilionensis E pavilionensis and E strain Because Exiguobacterium sp thrives in an environment where it is exposed to multiple stress conditions including UV radiation high salinity and high temperature among others we hypothesized that its genome encoded known genetic determinants required for stress resistance tolerance Using BLAST searches against SwissProt protein sets for known stress we found that strain possesses several genes encoding proteins related to the response or adaptation to

relative strain including the gene that encodes an accessory or secondary arsenic efflux pump et al Phylogenetic Analysis of Exiguobacterium sp Strain We further investigated if members of the Exiguobacterium genus showed a similar pattern as in the ANI analysis but under a phylogenetic framework To avoid the detrimental effects of horizontally transferred genes in phylogenetic inference genes related to ribosome and replication were selected to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the group Inference partitioned see Materials and Interestingly the topology of the tree mirrors the classification proposed by Vishnivetskaya et al and is consistent with the ANI results Figure column and Some species seem to be monophyletic E E E sibiricum while others do not form monophyletic groups E E acetylicum suggesting that more extensive sampling and clearer taxonomic classification schemes are needed FIGURE phylogenetic analysis of Exiguobacterium isolates Tree rooted phylogeny of Exiguobacterium recovers Group I and II phylogenetic groups Note that Exiguobacterium sp is part of Group II Matrix Distribution and copy number of genes among Exiguobacterium genomes The first two columns indicate Vishnivetskaya et al groupings and ANI clustering respectively genes are by copy number A previous work investigated the genomes of several Exiguobacterium strains to determine if there could be genes by using southernblot hybridization and Exiguobacterium sibiricum as the reference strain Group II does not contain the selected genes or may contain them with identity Vishnivetskaya et al Given the current availability of genome sequences we set out to confirm if the group pattern found by Vishnivetskaya et al was also present in our dataset Using a bidirectional blast hit approach of the genes described by Vishnivetskaya et al were found to be present in both groups This finding was confirmed by annotating those genes using the suite with similar results The

in Supplementary Table Pan Genome and Gene Ontology Analysis As the strains used for the analyses come from disparate environments Table we evaluated whether the core and accessory genome varied in size and biological function Exiguobacterium genomes are highly divergent Figure and hence a pan genome analysis was conducted pan genome size The analysis showed that the core genome is composed of genes and the accessory genome of genes The pan genome size and functional composition was also evaluated according to clusters defined at ANI Overall pan genome size ranged from to was consistent between groups and increased according to the number of genomes within a cluster Table Cluster V which only includes the genomes of strains and had the largest accessory genome sampled so far in the genus explaining the increased genome size of strains in this cluster These results highlight the high degree of variability in gene content among strains from the Exiguobacterium genus and suggest that a more thorough sampling of the Altiplano region would likely yield novel gene families Table Pan genome results of the six Exiguobacterium strains clusters Cluster Strains Pan genome Core genome Accessory genome I II III IV V VI Asterisks indicate the number of gene families of core or accessory genes on the pan genome of each To further investigate the composition of the accessory genome we interrogated gene distribution according to GO categories Accessory genes related to the GO categories Binding and Catalytic Activity were more abundant within the accessory genome while other functions such as Antioxidant Activity Biological Regulation and Cell Part were homogeneously distributed Figure Interestingly the genomes of cluster V and showed a higher proportion of genes belonging to GO categories such as Catalytic activity Cell part Membrane Metabolic process Structural molecule activity and Cellular process Figure Metal Metalloid Response Genes in Exiguobacterium Genomes The genomes of all strains were searched for the presence and patterns of metal metalloid response genes and whether their distribution matched the phylogenetic and ANI classifications The analysis revealed the presence of several genes involved in metal metalloid response of which most were related to cobalt zinc cadmium copper mercury tellurium chromium and arsenic resistance Table Previous studies showed that strain is resistant to arsenic Belfiore et al et al and that it encodes a secondary arsenic efflux pump named Because and are closely related we investigated if strain and other members of the Exiguobacterium genus also encoded the genetic determinants required for arsenic resistance including For this purpose strain was used as a reference Based on the presence and identity of the genes and operon organization two distinct patterns were observed In most cases these patterns matched the two phylogenetic groups described before with the exception of E marinum DSM from group II and E indicum E antarcticum DSM and E undae from group I Figure The efflux gene is less frequent in Exiguobacterium genomes and was only found in strains and showing an identity of

presence of genes required for arsenic detoxification in strain correlated with increased arsenic resistance we conducted growth curves with different As and As concentrations Figure and determined the MIC for each compound Strain was able to grow in media containing up to mM As and mM indicating that it is resistant to arsenic A similar result was observed for strain FIGURE Arsenic resistance

in media without arsenic was used as a control The high arsenic resistance of strain has been explained in part by the presence of the gene et al A structural analysis showed that from strains and have an amino acid sequence identity of and that key amino acids are conserved between both proteins For example residues and are part of the core transmembrane segment and together with could be required for As binding However some variations were observed at different sections of the protein i e residues and We speculate that and could be regulated by serine kinases Figure To gain insights into the mechanism of arsenic resistance strain was grown to growth phase challenged with mM As or mM As and the transcript levels of genes required for arsenic resistance were quantified by Figure and compared to the levels in untreated cells The expression of arsB encoding a membrane efflux transporter increased in the presence of both As and As although in the later case a greater increase was observed Previous studies found a similar trend and showed that As exposure resulted in higher transcript and protein levels of ArsB than with As et al Belfiore et al Andres and Bertin No significant differences in the transcript levels of arsC encoding arsenate reductase were observed after As exposure Conversely after As exposure arsC expression was strongly repressed Previous studies reported that arsC is part of the ars operon in most bacteria et al Kruger et al Andres and Bertin however in the Exiguobacterium genus arsC is not within the context of an operon Figure The expression of arsR encoding the negative regulator of the ars operon increased after As exposure As ArsR directly detects As Slyemi and Bonnefoy this suggests that in strain As exposure results in increased expression of the ars operon by decreasing the levels of ArsR FIGURE Expression of genes required for arsenic resistance in Exiguobacterium sp in response to and exposure Expression of the rRNA gene was used as a normalizer p The expression of increased after As but not As exposure in strain Interestingly it was proposed that expression is constitutive in strain and does not change in response to arsenic et al This suggests that the expression of genes required for arsenic resistance could be different in both strains although we cannot rule out that the observed result is caused by different experimental conditions between the studies Discussion The Chilean Altiplano harbors a series of environmental conditions that configures a specific and unique microbiota g Dorador et al et al Exiguobacterium is a frequently isolated from different environments including other saline wetlands g Cuatro Rebollar et al where it has been determined that genetic differentiation of Exiguobacterium are defined by the ecology of diverse habitats Members of the Exiguobacterium genus carry a number of genetic determinants including metal metalloid resistance genes which largely correlate with the phylogenetic structure Figure In particular Exiguobacterium encodes proteins required for arsenic resistance including which has only been described in Exiguobacterium et al Figures We also found that the accessory genome of Exiguobacterium is large and that the presence of genes involved in interactions with the environment g catalytic activity binding metabolic is variable Figure Altogether these results suggest that the Exiguobacterium genus is cosmopolitan diverse and possibly ancient with a broad repertoire of genetic elements that allow them to efficiently adapt to local environmental conditions Figure Exiguobacterium strains showed variability in the GO categories related to adaptation such as catalytic activity transporter activity nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity metabolic process etc Conversely less variability was observed in the GO categories related to fundamental cellular functions e g structural molecule activity membrane constituents macromolecular complex cell parts and biological regulation In agreement with our findings Yumoto et al reported that E oxidotolerans JCM differed from other closely related strains in their physiological and biochemical characteristics e g growth temperature range acid production from several substrates and enzymatic activities Our analyses support these results showing that E oxidotolerans JCM appears to be distinct based on its phylogenetic position ANI similarity and gene repertoire In agreement with the high levels of radiation that it must withstand in its environment et al Molina et al the genome of strain comprises several genes encoding proteins required for UV radiation resistance including the uvr mut rec and ruv the ssb lexA phrB and genes photoprotective pigments and those required for detoxifying oxidative stress Kurth et al Surprisingly strain did not show any highly relevant distinctive features For example previous studies found four copies of ssb in the genome of strain et al In Deinococcus radiodurans the presence of high copy numbers of ssb was proposed to be responsible for its superior radioresistance and DNA repair efficiency Eggington et al Cox and Battista Norais et al Long read sequencing technologies such as PacBio or Oxford Nanopores could aid in determining with certainty whether has experienced the duplication of gene families involved in stress response Some Exiguobacterium strains are resistant to NaCl and heavy metals such as Pb Cu and Hg Petrova et al Bian et al In particular Exiguobacterium isolated from permafrost sediments in Russia and Canada that contained of mercury carried the mer operon Petrova et al Our results show that all of the Exiguobacterium strains included in the analyses have the merA gene but that only strains had additional genes of the operon Table The mer operon can be located in the chromosome plasmids or transposons and has been studied as a mechanism of horizontal dissemination that confers a broad spectrum of mercury resistance among Bacillus and related species Bogdanova et al Other strains such as isolated from agricultural soils irrigated with tannery effluents in India resist up to mM of potassium chromate Alam and Malik and some isolates tolerate up to mM and reduce mM of Sarangi and Krishnan Additionally some Exiguobacterium isolates are able to reduce anaerobically in a large range of temperatures pH and salt concentrations Pattanapipitpaisal et al Okeke Our comparative genomics approach confirms that all Exiguobacterium strains possess the genes encoding proteins required for chromate reduction and efflux namely chrR and srpC respectively which could be responsible for chromate resistance in this genus Exiguobacterium sp is more closely related to the arsenic resistant strain Belfiore et al The high arsenic resistance of strain has been explained by an increased number of genes encoding proteins required to detoxify this toxic compound and by the presence of the gene which confers increased arsenite and arsenate resistance and mM Belfiore et al et al In agreement strain is also arsenic resistant which could be explained by the presence of several proteins required for its detoxification including In the era technologies have enabled researchers with the power to interrogate genomes from the dark matter of the microbial tree of life Wu et al Yet the traditional use of morphology phenotype biochemical traits and inferences to classify microorganisms implies that our current understanding of what constitutes a species or genus is imperfect Hugenholtz et al Herein we show that using an extreme of ANI in a relatively small dataset yielded as many as six clusters in an otherwise unified genus While comparative genomics studies of polyextremohiles are needed to understand their distribution evolutionary history and biotechnological potential thorough sampling designs studies and functional assays such as those based on metabolomics transcriptomics and proteomics will enable researchers to develop a systems level understanding of the patterns and processes leading to molecular adaptation Author

with these terms High dream recallers show a larger brain reactivity to auditory stimuli during wakefulness and sleep as compared to low dream recallers and also more wakefulness but no other modification of the sleep macrostructure To further understand the possible causal link between brain responses ISW and dream recall we investigated the sleep microstructure of HR and LR and tested whether the amplitude of auditory evoked potentials was predictive of arousing reactions during sleep Participants HR were presented with sounds during a whole night of sleep in the lab and polysomnographic data were recorded Sleep microstructure rapid eye movements muscle twitches spindles was assessed using visual and automatic validated methods AEPs to arousing or and stimuli were subsequently computed No difference in the microstructure of sleep was found In sleep auditory arousing stimuli elicited a larger positivity and an increased late frontal negativity as compared to stimuli As compared to LR HR showed more arousing stimuli and more long awakenings regardless of the sleep stage but did not show more numerous or longer arousals These results suggest that the amplitude of the brain response to stimuli during sleep determine subsequent awakening and that awakening duration not is the critical parameter for dream recall Notably our results led us to propose that the minimum necessary duration of an awakening during sleep for a successful encoding of dreams into memory is approximately min EEG dreaming awakenings arousals sleep oddball paradigm Agence Nationale de la Recherche Introduction Nearly everyone has awakened once with a dream in mind The dream recall frequency however can vary substantially between individuals and even within one person from time to time For more than a century researchers have investigated whether some psychological parameters could explain dream recall frequency variability a review see Ruby but only recently that physiological parameters have been considered Using Electroencephalogram and PET we found neurophysiological differences between high and low during both sleep and wakefulness et al Eichenlaub et al b Notably during wakefulness in response to auditory novel stimuli the brain response and a late parietal component were found to be larger in HR than in LR During sleep differences were also observed for auditory evoked potentials to the same stimuli at the latency of the in and at later latencies during all sleep stages Finally at the behavioral level HR showed more wakefulness than LR min more on average see Eichenlaub et al Taken together these results suggest a causal link between neurophysiological responses to auditory stimuli and ISW We proposed that this link could be subserved by the amplitude of the brain response to external stimuli et al and hypothesized that large neurophysiological responses to sounds during sleep are responsible for subsequent awakenings Indeed Bastuji et al demonstrated that during sleep and rapid eye movements the amplitude of a late parietal positive component in response to painful stimulation was significantly enhanced in trials that were followed by an arousing reaction it a short arousal of s or an awakening lasting more than The authors concluded that response to nociceptive stimuli during sleep predicted subsequent arousing reactions However such results remain to be demonstrated for auditory stimuli This hypothesis was not tested in our previous study because of a too small number of sounds followed by an awakening which prevented us from computing reliable AEPs et al Awakenings at least s by are indeed far less frequent for auditory stimuli than for painful stimuli et al Nonetheless considering that arousals awakenings lasting less than are also far more frequent than full awakenings more numerous in Bastuji et al we hoped that considering arousals in addition to awakenings would allow us to investigate potentials to auditory arousing stimuli are far more frequent than painful stimuli during sleep in everyday Mechanisms responsible for arousing reactions are important to consider regarding dream recall since the model postulates that ISW is the enabling factor for dreams to be encoded in long term memory and Goodenough Previous results from our group and other teams et al De Gennaro et al argue in favor of this hypothesis but several parameters remain to be investigated to clarify and strengthen our understanding of the link between ISW and dream recall Notably sleep macro and microstructure need to be exhaustively investigated to identify or exclude the involvement of other sleep parameters in dream recall and to specify the characteristics of awakenings associated with a higher dream recall frequency g distribution in the sleep cycle duration and alpha The goals of the present study were to further investigate the hypothesis of a causal link between AEPs and subsequent arousing reactions et al and the hypothesis of a causal link between ISW and dream recall and Goodenough Eichenlaub et al To this purpose we first scored arousals in data previously acquired and reported in Eichenlaub et al to have a full assessment of the arousing reactions in the sleep Thanks to this scoring AEPs to arousing stimuli e stimuli followed by an arousal or a full awakening in the first s post and to stimuli were then computed Second several parameters of the sleep macrostructure were computed such as the distribution of awakenings and the number of stage shifts across the sleep cycle spectral power of the delta rhythm during the first sleep cycle frequency and spectral power of the alpha rhythm during and wakefulness Finally as many previous results justified to investigate sleep microstructural components regarding dream recall a thorough analysis of the sleep microstructure of HR and LR was conducted Sleep spindles and the alpha frequency during wakefulness have been related to memory abilities Ulrich the REMs of REM sleep to dream content and Kleitman Roffwarg et al Molinari and Foulkes to sleep stability et al Colrain and muscles twitches may be considered as the physiological expression of oneiric behaviors thought to be an acting out of dreams Sastre and Jouvet Each of these parameters was computed using either visual muscle twitches and automatic validated methods Such a systematic analysis of macrostructural and microstructural sleep parameters have scarcely been reported in healthy subjects especially using automatic methods and never among HR and LR Materials and Methods We data presented in previous articles et al Ruby et al b Subjects Eighteen HR years dream recall mornings per and LR years dream recall morning per were selected out of participants who completed an online questionnaire on their sleep and dream habits they were unaware that dream recall frequency was an inclusion Participants were subsequently contacted by telephone and selected as HR or LR upon confirming dream recall on mornings per week or mornings per month respectively Gender age habitual sleep duration habitual sleep time education level and the size of the place of residence of the subjects were controlled and did not differ between the two groups The local ethics committee Leon approved this study and subjects provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki The subjects were paid for their participation For more details concerning inclusion criteria refer to Eichenlaub et al Stimuli During both sleep and wakefulness subjects were presented with two different first names included as novels in an oddball novelty paradigm The first names consisted of the first name of the subject and an unfamiliar first name They were normalized for duration and amplitude and presented with a probability of occurrence of each Responses to frequent standard tones p and rare deviant tones p were not considered in this study Stimulus onset asynchrony was set at ms except for the standard following a novel which appeared ms after the novel onset whatever the duration of the novel Stimuli were presented in a order et al binaurally and at dB above the hearing threshold of the subject Electrophysiological Recordings EEG data were recorded from AgCl electrodes placed according to the extended International System The was recorded from two electrodes placed on the supraorbital ridge of the left eye and on the infraorbital ridge of the right eye Muscle activity electromyogram was recorded from two electrodes attached to the chin Polysomnographic data EMG were continuously recorded using a BrainAmp system Products GmbH with an amplification gain of a filter of Hz and a sampling rate of Hz Procedure Subjects slept at night in a bed in the lab while polysomnographic data were acquired Stimuli were presented through earphones during the whole night thus ensuring constancy of stimulus input throughout the night despite head movements et al When possible subjects were awakened in the morning by the experimenters after min of REM sleep and were subsequently asked to report any dreams or sleep mentation For more details see Eichenlaub et al Data Analysis Sleep Macrostructure Polysomnographic data have been scored according to the standard guidelines et al Silber et al using epochs to identify the sleep macrostructure of the subjects Scoring was done both by an automatic software version Physip France Berthomier et al and by an expert scorer for more details see Eichenlaub et al The comparison between JBE and ASEEGA shown of agreement with a kappa coefficient of All further analyses in the present study are based solely on the hypnograms For each group the following sleep parameters were measured Awakenings Total number of awakenings over the sleep period Awakening index defined as the number of awakenings per hour of sleep computed for the total sleep time and REM Awakening duration defined as the average duration of Awakening type defined as the percentage of long and short awakenings min min and min as in Goldenberg et al Stage shifts Total number of stage shifts over the sleep period time transitions from and to W and Sleep Microstructure Arousals Arousals were visually scored according to the ASDA criteria Sleep Disorders Association They were defined as any shift in the EEG frequency to alpha or theta for at least s irrespective of changes in submental EMG during NREM sleep but accompanied by a at least s increase in EMG amplitude during REM sleep Typically arousals last between s and s Supplementary Figure for an example of However since arousal scoring is independent from the scoring of sleep macrostructure arousals may last more than s not more than s without being considered as awakenings according to the standard guidelines they start on one page and continue on the next Moreover the ASDA rules also state that an arousal has to be preceded by at least s of continuous sleep which means that a minimum of s of intervening sleep is necessary between two arousals Arousal were scored by RV and PR RV scored arousal first PR reviewed the scoring realized by RV and proposed modifications then RV checked the propositions and in case of disagreement a consensus was reached after discussion The parameters that were considered in the present study are the total number of arousals over the sleep period the arousal index defined as the number of arousals per hour of sleep computed for TST REM as well as for epochs scored as indeterminate and movements and the arousal duration defined as the average duration of arousals Rapid eye movements REMs are a core feature of REM sleep et al Silber et al In order to assess if there is any difference in the amount of REMs during REM sleep between HR and LR we developed a detection of saccades in the EOG Supplementary Figure We used independent component analysis to extract free from artifacts from the original polysomnographic data Then for each subject two components showing eye movements were visually selected and subsequently analyzed with the following method The signal was smoothed using a moving average with a window of ms The first derivative of the signal was computed and converted into absolute value A ms step was chosen for the derivative since most of naturally occurring human saccades have magnitudes of or less and last thus no more than ms maximum velocity of a saccade is above s see Bahill et al We then applied an arbitrary threshold standard deviations to allow for an optimal detection of REMs Finally the quality of the detection was visually checked on a subpart of the data of several subjects The total number of REMs was defined as the sum of REMs detected in the two components during REM sleep Muscle twitches REM sleep is characterized by a flat muscle tone and MTs which can be identified using electromyographic recordings with electrodes on the chin et al Silber et al To compare MTs between HR and LR a analysis of the EMG was developed Supplementary Figure First a notch filter at Hz was applied on the EMG signal Second the envelope of the signal was computed using standard Hilbert transform band Vidal et al The obtained envelope was normalized and smoothed using a moving average with a window As for REMs a threshold was empirically chosen to obtain an optimal detection of MTs Each clusters with a duration superior to ms were scored as MTs Finally the quality of the detection was visually checked on a subpart of the data of several subjects Three subjects were excluded from the analysis because of a too noisy EMG signal We assessed the total number of REMs and MTs in REM sleep and the density of REMs MTs defined as the average number of REMs MTs per minute for the total REM sleep duration Sleep spindles A sleep spindle is a train of distinct Hz waves predominant over central EEG derivations and lasting more than s et al Silber et al An automatic method was used to detect sleep spindles This iterative approach uses automatic thresholds based on EEG power ratios in frequency bands The detection was performed on CzPz channel both raw EEG data and EEG were used in the analysis more details refer to et al are defined by the AASM et al Silber et al as well delineated negative sharp wave immediately followed by a positive component with a total duration s typically maximal at frontal KCs were detected using an validated method et al which is based on a combination of the tunable wavelet transform and a morphological component analysis This approach requires an initial calibration step where a small subset of the data is visually scored for KCs and then used to derive an optimal threshold Once the training is achieved the algorithm runs on the entire dataset to automatically detect KCs For both KCs and spindles the outcome measures were the total number of KCs spindles detected and the density which is the number per min of sleep Spectral and Frequency Analysis Delta power EEG delta spectral power in the first sleep cycle is a marker of homeostatic sleep pressure et al Huber et al Calculation of the normalized spectral power of CzPz in the delta band was performed using a fast Fourier transform with Hanning window for consecutive epochs after automatic artifact rejection Alpha power and predominant frequency A specific analysis of the alpha band was performed after automatic artifact rejection For each s epoch of the EEG CzPz signal the alpha normalized power and the mean of the instantaneous frequency weighted by the alpha power were computed We assessed the predominant frequency and normalized power of alpha band for wakefulness and BSW epochs and the normalized power of delta band in the first sleep cycle For both delta and alpha power values are reported in percent after normalization in five frequency bands Hz theta Hz alpha Hz beta Hz sigma in order to avoid low frequency artifact and powerline artifacts Hence for each epoch the sum of normalized values in the five bands is equal to Potentials Analysis AEPs were analyzed using Elan pack software et al and Matlab AEPs elicited by first names were averaged over an epoch of ms including a prestimulus period of ms Prior to averaging trials were automatically excluded if the overall electrophysiological signal amplitude exceeded during Epoch were baseline corrected according to the period and a butterworth digital filter was applied to averaged responses Arousing reactions were considered as if occurring within s after stimulus onset Sleep Disorders Association Statistical Analysis comparisons of the sleep characteristics were achieved using Student t level of significance p In addition a nested ANOVA tested the sleep stage levels REM and the group levels HR effects on the parameters of the macrostructure and duration of and microstructure of sleep and duration of Post hoc analyses t were used in case of significance The analysis of the AEPs was performed using tests at each sampling point and at each a priori chosen electrode Fz Cz Pz for grand averaged responses We used Wilcoxon matched rank sign tests to compare AEPs between conditions vs p To take into account the issue of multiple comparisons we chose to apply both spatial limitations based on previous results to the results of Bastuji et al and Eichenlaub et al we expected condition effects for the contrast arousing stimuli vs stimuli on AEPs at frontal and i e to consider only a limited amount of electrodes and temporal and spatial constraints to decrease the chances of false positive i e considering a difference significant only if more than consecutive samples were significantly different for at least two adjacent electrodes and Buchwald This method has the advantage of taking spatial and temporal priors into account and is classically used in electrophysiology to correct for multiple comparisons g Caclin et al et al Eichenlaub et al Results Sleep Parameters Table shows the main sleep parameters of the experimental night in the lab for the two groups reported in Eichenlaub et al

associated with an arousing reaction within s stimuli in average per Arousals prevailed over awakenings The mean latency between stimulus onset and arousing reactions was s in REM sleep of auditory stimuli were associated with an arousing reaction within s stimuli in average per Arousals prevailed over awakenings The mean latency between stimulus onset and arousing reactions was s in REM sleep As expected for auditory stimuli et al Bastuji and Lavigne a small percentage of stimuli led to an arousing reaction For the evoked potential analysis to avoid a poor ratio we retained for further analysis subjects with at least arousing stimuli in the same sleep stage These constraints restricted the analysis to the most represented sleep stage i e for which subjects HR and showed more than arousing stimuli after artifact rejection AEPs to Arousing vs Stimuli in Grand averaged responses to arousing and stimuli in are displayed in Figure A sample of stimuli was randomly selected so that the number of averaged stimuli was equivalent for the arousing and conditions Significant differences between the two conditions in were found at frontal and occipital topographies The amplitudes of a late positive and a late negative at components were significantly enhanced for arousing stimuli at occipital electrodes and and frontal electrodes respectively Fz Figure Brain responses to first names according to the presence or absence of an arousing reaction following the stimulus in sleep Grand averaged responses Gray vertical bars highlight significant differences Wilcoxon test p for more than Statistical significance of Wilcoxon test p for more than performed at electrodes in the period AEPs to Arousing vs Stimuli in as a Function of the Delay Between Stimuli and Arousing Reactions According to the hypothesis that the amplitude of the AEPs to stimuli presented during sleep is related to the subsequent reaction of the sleeper one would expect that the shorter the delay between the stimulus and the arousing reaction the larger the amplitude of the evoked response to the stimulus To test this hypothesis we compared AEPs to stimuli quickly followed by an arousing reaction reaction in the s after stimulus and to stimuli followed by a late arousing reaction s after stimulus For this analysis paired statistics were not possible because of an insufficient number of subjects having more than events in both conditions Instead we used the test to compare nine subjects with more than events within s events in and subjects with more than events within s events in Grand averaged responses are displayed in Figure At occipital electrodes the amplitude of a late parietal positivity was significantly enhanced when the arousing reaction occurred within the first s as compared to the last s A comparable effect was observed at frontal electrodes for the amplitude of a large negative wave peaking between ms and ms Figure Brain responses to first names leading to a rapid arousing reaction the s post stimulus black thick to a delayed arousing reaction s and s gray thick and to no arousing reactions in sleep Gray vertical bars highlight significant differences between rapid and delayed arousing reactions test p for more than Discussion In this study we further investigated the hypothesis of a causal link between ERPs to auditory stimuli and subsequent arousing reactions et al and the hypothesis of a causal link between ISW and dream recall and Goodenough Eichenlaub et al The reanalysis of EEG data et al Ruby et al b enabled us to characterize more precisely the sleep macro and microstructure of HR and LR thanks to visual and validated automatic methods For awakenings no interaction between group and sleep stages was found it for the awakening index or for awakenings showing that awakenings were longer in HR than in LR whatever the sleep stage We also observed significantly more long awakenings than and less short ones in HR than in LR Regarding the alpha predominant frequency and alpha power during ISW and BSW no differences were found but the overall frequency and power of the alpha rhythm was slightly lower in ISW than in BSW There were no differences in the delta power during the first sleep cycle or in the number of stage shifts during SPT Moreover no difference was found for the parameters of the sleep microstructure considered namely arousals duration and sleep spindles in KCs number and density in REMs number and density in REM MTs number and density in REM Finally thanks to the scoring of arousals we could compute AEPs to arousing and stimuli and reproduce the results obtained for painful stimuli showing that the amplitude of the AEPs was predictive of the subsequent arousing reaction AEPs to Arousing and Stimuli The scoring of arousals in Eichenlaub et al data resulted in a great increase of the stimuli categorized as arousing Still auditory stimuli presented at an average intensity dB above the hearing level of the induced far less arousing reaction than did laser nociceptive stimuli in Bastuji et al Among all the arousing reactions arousals largely prevailed over awakenings Considering both arousals and awakening improved our ability to test whether AEPs amplitude to stimuli presented during sleep was related to subsequent arousing reactions but only in the most represented sleep stage Results revealed that auditory first names followed within s by an arousing reaction elicited a larger occipital positivity and also a larger frontal negative wave than stimuli Similarly Bastuji et al found that arousing laser nociceptive stimuli induced a larger late parietal positive component than stimuli in and REM sleep We further found that the shorter than s vs more than the delay between the stimulus onset and the subsequent arousing reaction the larger the amplitude of the AEPs These results tie convincingly the amplitude to subsequent arousing reaction and question the fact that arousing reaction arising between s and s after the stimulus onset are truly stimulus related Our results show that arousing auditory stimuli induce arousing reaction through a cerebral mechanism similar to the one described for nociceptive stimuli i e an increased amplitude of the evoked response Interestingly the topographies of the responses for the two sensory modalities are different No frontal difference was found between ERPs to arousing and stimuli in Bastuji et al study whereas we found a large one in our study The large amplitude of this frontal wave might have masked the parietal component that was reported in Bastuji et al study on parietal electrodes It may explain that the arousing effect appeared only on occipital electrodes in our study since they are less influenced by frontal components The late components have traditionally been associated with complex cognitive processes such as semantic or memory processes Eichenlaub et al This could reflect a high level cognitive processing of the stimuli possibly triggering a subsequent arousing reaction The frontal component larger for arousing auditory stimuli is thought to reflect evoked KCs or et al Bastien et al Bastuji et al According to previous work KCs have been traditionally viewed as indicative of an arousal process a review see Colrain also suggested that they could reflect an arousal response to exogenous stimuli since they are often followed by arousing reactions This view fits well with the fact that this frontal response is enhanced for auditory arousing stimuli as compared to stimuli but it does not fit with the fact that this component is more prominent for the auditory stimuli than for painful stimuli which are more arousing This frontal response may rather be explained by an opposite functional role proposed for KCs Some studies have shown that there is an increased proportion of KCs in situation of increased sleep drive and thus decreased arousability et al Nicholas et al Peszka and Harsh Colrain These latter results are more in favor of an endogenous nature of KCs which could help maintaining sleep et al This interpretation of KCs may explain that auditory stimuli are less arousing than painful ones due to their elicitation of a component frontal in addition to an arousing component These findings suggest that the amplitude of ERPs to stimuli presented during sleep is predictive whatever the sensory modality of a subsequent arousing reaction Such a link was previously shown for somatosensory painful e potentially dangerous not for sounds which are much more frequent in our daily life and far less often dangerous than painful ones Awakenings and Dream Recall The increased amount of ISW in HR reported in our previous work raised several questions If ISW is increased in HR as compared to LR is it also true for arousals What is the minimum duration of an awakening to allow for the encoding of some information into long term memory What about the other components of the sleep microstructure Many previous results justified to investigate sleep microstructural components regarding dream recall Sleep spindles and the alpha frequency during wakefulness have been related to memory abilities Ulrich the REMs of REM sleep to dream content and Kleitman Roffwarg et al Molinari and Foulkes KCs to sleep stability et al Colrain and muscles twitches may be considered as the physiological expression of oneiric behaviors thought to be an acting out of dreams Sastre and Jouvet Interestingly our analysis of the sleep structure revealed no differences in the sleep microstructure of HR and LR for any of the parameters considered e arousals sleep spindles KCs REMs and Since the number of stage shifts and the delta power in the first sleep cycle were also not significantly different between groups these results leave awakenings as the only sleep parameter differentiating HR and LR sleep architectures Our further analysis of these awakenings notably their distribution in the sleep cycle revealed that the higher dream recall frequency of HR could not be explained by the REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming and Kleitman Ruby since awakenings were not found to be more numerous or longer in REM sleep in HR as compared to LR D Interestingly we found that the frequency of the alpha predominant rhythm was slightly lower during ISW as compared to BSW This is consistent with previous results that showed an increased power in the lower alpha range in the first minutes following an awakening as compared to the corresponding period et al According to Klimesch which showed that the alpha frequency of good memory performers is about Hz higher than those of bad performers the decrease of alpha frequency in ISW could explain the difficulties in memory recall at awakening of dreams or of awakenings during However alpha frequency was not different in HR and LR and can thus not explain their differences in dream recall What seems to be the best predictor of dream recall is the awakenings duration During a night of sleep in the lab with sound presentation in average the awakenings of HR were twice longer than those of LR The reanalysis of the data further showed that if the distribution of short and long awakenings is as expected in young healthy subjects et al i e with a great majority of short proportion of each category of awakenings was significantly different between the two groups HR experienced a significantly higher proportion of long awakenings than LR while LR experienced more short awakenings than HR This result is interesting to discuss regarding those of a study which investigated the relationship between the duration of awakenings and awareness and Webb The task was to press a whenever they gained awareness of being awake during sleep while polysomnographic data were acquired They found that of the unreported arousals awakenings were shorter than min This result in addition to ours but no arousals difference between HR and LR average awakenings duration of min vs min in HR vs LR more awakenings longer than min in HR than in suggest that awareness and or memory of awakenings and dreams is dependent on the duration of awakenings and that the minimum duration for an awakening to allow for memory encoding is approximately min Given that according to available data the brain is not able to encode new information into explicit memory during sleep and that the brain is in a very different state during sleep and wakefulness it seems not unrealistic that some time is needed to restore the ability of the brain at awakening Our results support but also extend and precise the model proposed by Koulack and Goodenough We found that awakenings duration is the only candidate among the numerous tested parameters assessing sleep macro and microstructure to explain dream recall that the duration of awakenings rather than the frequency was the critical factor and that the required duration for an awakening to allow for memory encoding was approximately min A limitation of this study is the smaller number of arousing reactions as compared to Bastuji et al study with painful stimuli For this reason we could not investigate AEPs in all the sleep stages Second automatic vs visual detection of microstructural sleep parameters is a debated issue in the sleep community g Wallant et al As a consequence even if no between groups difference have been observed the figures of K complexes spindles MTs and REMs during REM have to be considered cautiously since they may have been different if the detection had been made visually Thirdly it should be kept in mind that our sleep measures does not reflect natural sleep since sounds were presented to participants during the whole night That said most of the computed sleep parameters were close or within the range of standard values and it is therefore reasonable to assume that sleep quality was generally preserved despite the experimental setup and auditory stimuli Finally regarding the interpretation of the AEPs to arousing stimuli it should be kept in mind that the functional role of KCs regarding sleep depth is still unclear and debated since it has been found that KCs do not change in the recovery night after sleep deprivation et al KCs show a linear decline across the adult lifespan et al they drop in patients with Alzheimer disease et al and sensory stimulation increases their probability in the ascending slopes of the sleep cycles to a higher degree than in the descending ones Conclusion We have shown that brain responses to auditory stimuli in are larger when followed by a subsequent arousing reaction in the s Coherently with our previous results suggesting a greater brain reactivity in HR HR demonstrated more arousing stimuli than LR during sleep Finally the reanalysis of our previous data et al highlighted that HR do not show any other sleep differences with LR apart from longer awakenings and more precisely more long and less short awakenings than LR The results of our team lead us to propose the following mechanism leading to a better recall of dreams in HR than in LR An increased activity in the junction at rest in HR as compared to LR et al would lead to a greater brain reactivity to external stimuli et al i e larger brain responses to stimuli which in turn would trigger more and longer arousing reactions during sleep These awakenings would finally give more opportunities to the brain to restore his abilities and therefore to encode the dream in long term

research field regarding research directions and topics over a defined period Such information enables stakeholders to quickly identify the most influential research and incorporate latest evidence into education To our knowledge no study reported changes in neuroscience literature over the last decade Therefore the current study determined research terms with highest citation scores compared publication shares of research areas and contributing countries in this field from to and identified the most productive journals Methods Data were extracted from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports Only articles and reviews published in journals classified under the JCR category over the period of interest were included Title and abstract fields of each included publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer to identify recurring terms with high relative citation scores Two term maps were produced for publications over the study period to illustrate the extent of and the impact of terms was evaluated based on their relative citation scores To further describe the recent research priority or spots terms with the highest relative citation scores were identified annually In addition by applying Bradford s law we identified journals being the most productive journals per annum over the survey period and evaluated their bilbiometric performances Results From to there were terms involved in the annual lists of top terms with highest relative citation scores The most frequently recurring terms were autism functional connectivity default mode network and neuroimaging Neuroscience research related to psychology and behavioral sciences showed an increase in publication share over the survey period and China has become one of the major contributors to neuroscience research Ten journals were frequently identified as core journals within the survey period Discussion The landscape of neuroscience research has changed recently and this paper provides contemporary overview for researchers and health care workers interested in this field s research and developments Brain imaging and brain connectivity terms had high relative citation scores

exciting research field and many recent discoveries have informed and innovations For instance the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Professors John O Keefe Moser and Edvard Moser neuroscientists who discovered place cells and grid cells that form a global positioning system inside the brain keefe and Burgess Moser et al Indeed neuroscience research has received substantial support across the globe In the United States the Human Connectome Project was launched in followed by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative in et al Concurrently the Human Brain Project was initiated in Europe In Japan the Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies for Disease Studies program started in and the Brain Science and Intelligence Technology project will soon be officially launched by China though significant preliminary research has already been done et al With these abundant investments in neuroscience in recent years more explorative fundamental or basic research could be conducted which eventually led to today s paradigm paradigm shifts yet to come For instance the emergence of brain connectivity studies in recent years may enable us to compare and contrast the normal and diseased brains and thus identify abnormal brain connectivity patterns as potential biomarkers for neurologic diseases These advances in the neuroscience field not only drive significant progress in brain biology but also confer practical implications to medicine We should evaluate and track the changes regarding the landscape of neuroscience research to indicate evolution regarding research directions health care priorities and prime translational research topics over a defined period Such information enables stakeholders to clearly and quickly identify the most influential research works and incorporate the latest evidence into education Bibliometric studies could provide relevant evaluations and assessments of the social and scientific relevance of a specific discipline or research field of interest et al There have been numerous bibliometric studies on the performance of neuroscience research outputs in specific countries including China et al India and Sweden et al In addition similar studies have been conducted in relevant research fields such as psychiatry and psychopharmacology et al However to our knowledge no published study has reported overall changes in the landscape of neuroscience literature across the globe over the last decade Therefore the aims of this study was to identify the most productive core journals in the field from to determine the research terms with the highest citation impact and compare the publication shares of research areas and contributing countries across these years Materials and methods Date source Data analyzed in this study were extracted from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports Both required a subscription and were hosted by Thomson Reuters Data extraction Publications indexed in WoS were included if they were articles or published in journals under the JCR and published from to Full records and cited references of the included publications were manually downloaded The analyses at the literature level maps annual terms and changes in research areas and contributing were based on all these and for each publication citations were counted until the end of November Term maps For each year the title and abstract fields of each included publication were extracted and analyzed via VOSviewer Eck and Waltman Two term maps one for and one for were produced to illustrate a network of recurring keywords showing their and relative citation impacts The details of the established methods and algorithms have been described in previous publications Eck et al Waltman et al In brief for each term map only terms that occurred at least times under binary counting were considered Note that binary counting only considers the number of publications in which a term was it disregards the number of occurrences of a term within a single publication General noun phrases were removed using an algorithm Eck and Waltman Of the remaining terms with the highest relevance score calculated via VOSviewer were used to form a term map to allow for network visualization The algorithm was designed to ensure that terms that more frequently were positioned closer to each other Terms that occurred more frequently had larger bubbles Before the final map was created we visually inspected the map removed irrelevant terms and combined the abbreviated forms of the noun phrases et al Depending on the citation counts of the respective publications each term received a relative citation score at that is represented by color Blue indicates below average green indicates average and red indicates above average The coloring scheme was based on previous publications Eck et al Waltman et al Annual terms For each year we examined terms that occurred at least times We then used VOSviewer to calculate a relative citation score for each term based on citation counts Normalized citation score based on average citation counts is one of the key concepts in bibliometrics The calculation was performed as follows For each year each publication was given a normalized citation score by dividing its number of citations in that by the average number of citations of all publications in that of the neuroscience field A score of implies the citation count of that particular publication equals the average of all publications appearing in neuroscience field in that year Subsequently each term received its own relative citation score by averaging the normalized citation scores of all publications in which the term occurred in the title or abstract Previous studies have documented the details of this automated procedure to identify terms with citation scores Eck et al Waltman et al We identified relevant terms with the highest relative citation score for each year in the survey period Their relative citation scores were tracked annually Growth of publication Price s Law one of the most widely utilized indicators for analyzing the growth of publication within a specific research field which was regularly applied to evaluate whether publication in a research field has experienced an exponential growth over a survey period et al was utilized to assess the annual change in publication count in neuroscience journals in the current study After plotting the annual publication count against year we applied the linear and exponential trend lines to the plot and recorded the mathematical equations forming the trend lines If the data fitted better to the exponential line than the linear line results will be considered as fulfilling the Price s Law Changes in research areas and contributing countries We identified the research areas and contributing countries of the publications in and the first and last year of the study period respectively These data were obtained by analyzing the search results in WoS In WoS publications to the journals where they were were classified into over research areas in which each area contains papers similar in scope and citation characteristics To illustrate the relationship with parameters the relationship between the publication shares of the most productive countries and their respective total per capita expenditure on health were evaluated as described in previous bibliometric studies et al Core journals under Bradford s law and their performance For each year Bradford s law of scattering was applied to identify the core journals in the neuroscience category The core journals identified for each year are those that contributed of total publications for that year To evaluate the bibliometric performance of the top core journals journals with highest frequency of occurrence in the annual core journal lists over the survey time trends of their Impact Factor Immediacy Index and Eigenfactor Score were evaluated IF indicates the yearly average citation count of its recent publications II refers to the average citation count of publications and ES though similar to IF weights citations according to the ranking of the citing journals The time trends of IF II and ES were evaluated by separate linear regressions with year as the independent variable and Jayaratne and Zwahlen The slope indicated the average magnitude of change over time and R indicated the fitness of the regression model Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS New York Results were significant if P Results From to a total of publications matched with the selection criteria of this study articles and reviews in JCR of which were articles and were reviews The marked annual increase in the number of neuroscience publications from to followed a linear trend more closely than an exponential curve Figure The linear fitting of the data obtained a coefficient of determination of r whereas the exponential fitting only obtained a coefficient of determination of r Term maps The term maps for and are shown in Figure For both maps terms on the left

neuroimaging For the red and orange bubbles are more concentrated on the left side of the map e g microglia and neuroinflammation Across the survey period some of the basic terms remained red and orange such as inflammation microglia mitochondria and tau Clinical terms remained blue and green such as mortality multiple sclerosis intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke Figure Term maps for neuroscience literature In general terms on the left are more related to cellular molecular or genetic neuroscience whereas terms on the right are more related to brain imaging Bubble size is related to the occurrence of terms in the titles and abstracts in the included publications Color is related to relative citation impact attributable to the terms with blue indicating below average green indicating average and red indicating above average Moving from to it could be observed that the terms on the left were gaining relative citation impact compared to the terms on the right Certain terms remained having relatively high citation scores such as inflammation microglia mitochondria and tau red and Some remained having relatively low citation scores such as ischemic stroke intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality Annual terms Ten relevant terms with highest impact were identified for each year from to they are listed in Table There were terms over the survey period The most frequently recurring term was autism in years out of Next were years out of functional connectivity years out of default mode network years out of and neuroimaging years out of Over the last

European countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom were also major contributors to the field One country with a substantial increase in publication share was China Between and its publication share in this field tripled vs Table With regard to data it seemed that the publication shares of the most productive countries were directly proportional to their respective total per capita

publication as counted by Web of Science hosted by Thomson Reuters Identification of core journals under Bradford s law The number of neuroscience journals increased from in to in In parallel the number of core journals doubled from in to in Six journals were consistently included as core journals throughout namely Brain Research Journal of Neurophysiology Journal of Neuroscience NeuroImage Neuroscience and Neuroscience Letters Together with four other journals namely Behavioural Brain Research Experimental Brain Research European Journal of Neuroscience and Journal of the Neurological Sciences they formed the top ten core neuroscience journals The complete list of core neuroscience journals is presented in Supplementary Table Table Division of neuroscience journals and publications from to according to Bradford s law Journal number Year Zone core Zone Zone Total According to Bradford s law journals were divided into three zones and each zone should contain of total publication count Zone journals were identified as core journals Publication count here refers to the total count of articles and reviews Bibliometric performance of core journals In general the core journals maintained their performance levels over the survey period Most core journals did not exhibit a significant change in IF from to One journal Brain Research had a significantly improved IF P whereas two journals experienced a significant decrease in IF namely Journal of Neurophysiology P and Journal of Neuroscience P Figure Bibliometric performances of the key core journals Time trends of Impact Factor Time trends of Immediacy Index Time trends of Eigenfactor Score Six of the core journals did not have a significant change in II over the survey period Three journals had significantly improved II namely Brain Research P NeuroImage P and Neuroscience Letters P One journal Journal of Neurophysiology had a decreased II P In terms of ES most core journals were subject to a decrease and only two an increase However these changes were small Discussion Using data from WoS and JCR the results of the current study revealed transformations in the field of neuroscience research from to in terms of leading or core journals distribution of publications research context and contributions by country No attempt was made to retrospectively analyze data earlier than because this study s focus only concerns recent bibliometric growth rather than the complete history of this research field The annual growth of neuroscience publications over the survey period indicated of Price s Law i e no exponential growth was observed It experienced a linear growth instead This linear increment was consistent with publications in adjacent research fields such as psychiatry et al and psychopharmacology et al On the other hand there was an exponential increase in publications in melatonin et al bipolar disorder et al and hyperactivity disorder et al Since the current study aimed at providing an overview of the neuroscience literature we did not apply Lotka s Law to evaluate the productivity of individual researchers Shifting of citation focus as seen from term maps The term maps from Figure illustrated the shift of citation focus from general brain imaging terms to cellular molecular and genetic terms In recent years molecular imaging of the brain is gaining attention such as that related to neuroinflammation of microglia and macrophages et al and neurodegeneration related to tau protein and Lewy body et al These research topics investigated in experimental animal models probably led to the increased relative citation impacts of these terms Certain clinical topics remained having low citation impacts such as multiple sclerosis intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke Brain imaging terms as recurring terms Results in Table demonstrated that brain imaging terms occupied three of the top five recurring terms namely default mode network functional connectivity and neuroimaging The rise in relative citation impact of brain connectivity terms was consistent with the launches of several research funds including the aforementioned BRAIN Initiative Human Brain Project and Human Connectome Project There were two other terms related to brain connectivity among the top highest impact terms tensor imaging and fractional One popular research topic was to investigate the known as functional of different brain regions et al One such network of during a resting state is called the default mode network which is believed to be robust across populations and as a result it has gained attention in recent years and Snyder Another area that merits mention is the advancement in the use of statistics such as the implementation of dynamic causal modeling to neuroimaging data in et al which have enabled an inference of effective connectivity This application illustrates the directionality of communications between brain regions during particular experimental tasks et al Yeung et al Though the terms related to effective connectivity were not in the annual top lists of terms during the survey period they may well be a potential hot spot in the field in the future The high impact of terms related to Alzheimer s disease over the last years As reported three terms always appeared on the top list of terms over the last years namely melatonin microglia and neurofibrillary tangle Collectively these three terms are related to Alzheimer s disease Evidence has suggested that Alzheimer s disease with intracellular neurofibrillary tangle a widely recognized biomarker is linked to neuroinflammatory changes caused by overactivation of microglia that can be alleviated by administration of melatonin et al Lin et al This effect of melatonin may be related to regulation of autophagy et al Moreover we identified Journal of Alzheimer s Disease as one of the core journals in the current study Together these findings suggest that topics relevant to this disease have recently become high impact Attention to autism Autism appeared in the annual list of top terms eight times in the survey period On average its relative citation score was count times that of an average outperforming the relative citation score of other neurological disorders such as major depressive disorder and mild cognitive impairment Research directions health care priorities and prime translational research topics Results of the current bibliometric study may help identify three important areas of neuroscience research research directions health care priorities and prime translational research topics First with regard to research directions it could be observed that brain imaging was one of the highest impact over the last decade Looking at health care priorities as it was demonstrated that was a term in neuroscience field researchers may consider conducting more to answer priority questions for better practices in health care industry or health care services As for prime translational research topics brain connectivity had high thus its aberrations among patients with various neurodegenerative or neurological disorders can now be further investigated Increased publication share of geriatrics and gerontology The publication share of geriatrics and gerontology doubled from to This was reasonably expected due to the aging population of the developed countries As the elderly people are more prone to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer s disease et al the citation impact of terms relevant to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation also increased over the study period The United States and European countries as major contributors Despite changes in research hot spots the most productive or countries did not change significantly between and Developed countries mainly ones in the Western world were still major contributors to neuroscience research i e Australia Canada France Germany Japan Netherlands Italy the United Kingdom and the United States Incidentally these countries were also previously identified as major contributors to various topics within or relevant to neuroscience such as neuroimaging et al Yeung et al and Parkinson s disease et al which means these countries may have relatively more established research backgrounds and research funding However with more economic development and financial input into academic research China has emerged as one of the important contributors in neuroscience research field in recent years The correlation of publication share in neuroscience with the per capita health expenditure of the most productive countries might be consistent with the notion that the higher the spending on health the more the research publication et al However it should be interpreted with caution because data from China and the United States were relatively influential as potential outliers Growth in publication and stability of key core journals identified by Bradford s law The annual publication and count of neuroscience research increased every year as did the number of neuroscience journals By applying Bradford s law of scattering we revealed that the percentage of journals classified as core journals likewise increased over the study years These changes indicated that this field has been growing and becoming more dispersed Besides the bibliometric performances of the key core journals were mostly stable over the study period Implications and future perspectives The shift of citation focus as seen from term maps and Table indicated the importance of animal models and in vitro studies together with human neuroimaging studies While neuroimaging studies may continue to unveil the brain function or neural mechanism of relevant physiological processes animal models and in vitro studies may also be required to explore and explain the details down to genetic cellular or molecular levels Moreover with the increasing publication count and wider distribution of publications among neuroscience journals future publications should devise keywords titles and abstracts more thoughtfully Search strategy of fellow researchers should be taken into careful consideration so that the relevant works can be identified retrieved from search engines or databases By considering the specific hot topics having high relative citation scores altogether future work may focus on utilizing brain imaging and connectivity analyses to identify biomarkers that may signify neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory tendency among the aging population Study limitations This study has certain limitations First this study is retrospective and though it tracked past or recent trends rapidly developing interests in a short period may not be accurately reflected Second the work examined in this study consists exclusively of articles and reviews published from to in JCR journals as indexed by WoS It may not be sufficient to represent all neuroscience literature such as other document formats published in journals or publications not included in this study As neuroscience interacts with many other academic fields some arguably relevant studies may have been published in journals not classified as neuroscience journals However it would be difficult to define search terms that effectively cover all papers touching on neuroscience across all scientific literature while simultaneously excluding irrelevant ones Therefore we focused on JCR journals Third the analyses in this study were based on data recorded in the WoS database Although Google Scholar and other databases may offer broader coverage much of this coverage may be attributed to journals with potentially limited audience Given that we aimed to determine research changes in the core of the neuroscience community we followed previous neuroscience bibliometric publications by only accessing WoS et al Li et al Bishop Therefore the results from the current study should be interpreted with considerations that journals of other sections of JCR diagnostic imaging biochemistry biology etc were not included Future studies may expand to them and consider the access to other databases such as PubMed Medline Scopus or Embase when deemed appropriate Besides VOSviewer future studies may consider using other bibliometric tools to further dissect the evidence such as using Pajek to analyze the citation and networks of selected data subsets and Mrvar and using Publish or Perish to evaluate the distribution of citations received by selected authors in terms of or Conclusions To conclude our findings revealed changes in the landscape of neuroscience research over the study period and provided a contemporary overview of neuroscience research for researchers and health care workers interested in this field Brain imaging and brain connectivity have been shown to be hot topics and Alzheimer s disease and associated topics have

Commons Attribution License http creativecommons org licenses by which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited Positive results have been uniformly observed by various researchers for plasma in early osteoarthritis knee in the past few years PRP has clearly demonstrated its supremacy in comparison to hyaluronic acid and placebo in various clinical trials and is undoubtedly the best option available for symptomatic treatment in early OA The release of growth factors from PRP occurs immediately and lasts for around three weeks and the clinical effect tends to wane down by the end of the year Prolonged and sustained release of growth factors from platelets could possibly help in much better biological healing and sustained clinical effects PRP in combination with biocompatible carriers could be one way of achieving this Gelatin hydrogel PRP and chitosan PRP seem to be promising based on early in vitro studies and animal studies PRP in combination with hyaluronic acid also seems to be additive This article intends to discuss the present status of the PRP confusions surrounding its use upcoming trends and ideas for improvising PRP for use early OA knees based on available evidence Early OA knee plasma Hyaluronic acid Introduction Osteoarthritis of the knee is one of the commonest problems faced by ageing adults and in order to alleviate the pain and morbidity associated with OA a variety of treatment modalities ranging from oral chondroprotectives steroids to viscosupplements have been tried by pain physicians and orthopaedicians worldwide plasma is evolving into a promising solution for various orthopaedic conditions like tendinopathies and arthritis of knee The success of PRP in treating sports injuries in several sportsmen has contributed to the hype surrounding the PRP therapy leading to increasing use of PRP for treating OA knees over the last seven years Mechanism by which PRP works for knee OA Osteoarthritis alters the normal joint metabolism favouring increased catabolism and decreased anabolism Platelet contain and release numerous growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor growth factor and transforming growth which could alter the changing joint mileu in OA PRP acts at various levels to alter the joint homeostasis In cartilage it decreases catabolism improves anabolism and promotes chondral remodelling Higher amounts of collagen II and prostaglandin synthesis have been documented by Akeda et al and Pereira et al Increasing chondrocyte proliferation and production of matrix molecules have also been documented Synoviocytes are influenced by increased hyaluronic acid secretion creating a more favourable and balanced state of angiogenesis and a decreased rise in some matrix metalloproteinases The apoptotic pathway of osteoarthritic chondrocytes is influenced as growth factor in PRP may downregulate the expression of programmed cell death Lower levels of apoptosis were detected in in vivo studies by Mifune et al and the authors suggested that complex interaction of PRP within joint might positively influence chondrocyte apoptosis An overall downmodulation of the joint inflammation can explain the pain reduction which is the most prominent and disabling symptom of knee OA This could be through the regulation of nuclear factor kappa B and the principal actors of inflammatory cascade Other factors could be the inhibition of transactivation activity mediated by HGF a key cytokine present in PRP or an action by inhibiting cell chemotaxis Wu et al showed that PRP counteracted the inflammatory cascade elicited by and tumor necrosis showing an inhibition of and gene expression Lee et al noticed increase in mRNA levels of cannabinoid receptors and involved in analgesic and and this could explain the analgesic effect of PRP Preparation of plasma PRP is the plasma fraction of autologous blood with platelet concentration above baseline Platelet counts of times of the baseline label the product as PRP Autogenous platelet gel platelet enriched plasma and concentrate are the synonyms for PRP There are various methods of PRP preparation and at least kits are commercially available Initial studies used PRP prepared in the laboratory by different techniques and based on these studies the commercial kits have evolved Broadly PRP can be prepared in two ways and Anitua et al had prepared PRP in a technique and open procedure which included and named the product as EndoRet rich in growth Patel et al also prepared PRP by the open technique which involved a and additional white blood cell filtration and their product was PRP Kon et al have prepared PRP by the technique and cryopreserved the product and used it at intervals Centrifugal forces and time as well as the number of spins vs alter the PRP product in terms of platelet count and leucocyte concentration Based on the variability in yield it became necessary to classify PRP in order to compare studies and two classification systems have evolved One is the Sports Medicine Plasma classification system by Mishra et al which takes into consideration the activation method or not and the leucocyte count or to divide the PRP into four types with each having two further subtypes A and B based on the platelet concentration The other international classification system is the PAW classification by DeLong et al which also takes into consideration the absolute platelet count low to the manner of platelet activation and presence or absence of leucocytes Platelet activation Platelet activation can be achieved by different activators Bovine or autologous thrombin is a traditional activator of platelets but there are concerns regarding its tolerability and adverse effects Calcium chloride is the most common activator used in the majority of clinical studies Collagen and batroxobin are some other activators which can be used Rodeo et al showed that activated platelets release of their growth factors within the first min and release most of the GFs within the next one hour These growth factors are absorbed by the fibrin gel formed which subsequently releases the various growth factors in a controlled way The content of fibrin in the gel is the most important factor controlling subsequent release Platelet concentration fibrinogen concentration and the enzymes involved in procoagulant pathway influence the final fibrin content The above factors regulate the duration of GF release at the injection site Studies aimed at improving the controlled delivery of GFs from PRP at the target site may bring out better results Some novel approaches under consideration are the use of chitosan and gelatin hydrogel as carriers of PRP In a rabbit OA model Saito et al demonstrated that gelatin hydrogel microspheres impregnated with PRP injections markedly suppressed OA progression both morphologically and histologically than the use of PRP alone Should leucocytes be always filtered out The type of PRP to be used is another topic of debate The confusion is between and PRP We raised our concern regarding this previously The initial hypothesis that leucocytes could be proinflammatory inside the joint to supposed deleterious effects of proteases and reactive oxygen species released from white has been subsequently corroborated Pifer et al showed in an in vivo study that PRP with leucocytes contains and which is released over a period of at least six days and can be deleterious Braun et al compared the effects of PRP PRP red blood cell concentrate and plasma and concluded that of synovial cells with and RBCs resulted in significant cell death and proinflammatory mediator Dragoo et al in a rabbit study showed that the group had more undesirable side effects owing to greater inflammatory reactions following injection at the lesion site than at the group Filardo et al These authors were the only ones to conduct a clinical trial comparing two different PRP preparations PRP versus low concentrate PRP They treated patients and evaluated up to months and comparable positive results were obtained in both treatments with the only difference being that the PRP leucocyte group suffered from more swelling and pain reaction immediately after the injections To add to the confusion there are some in vivo studies which document some beneficiary effects of leucocyte released products for the OA knee Cavallo et al in their in vitro study noticed that chondrocyte proliferation and hyaluronan secretion were more prevalent in than in Riboh et al in a recent compared clinical outcomes and rates of adverse reactions between and for the OA knee They concluded that both are clinically effective over HA and placebo and had similar safety profiles and adverse reactions to PRP may not be directly related to leucocyte concentration Thus there is still a need of research on this topic so as to standardize the concentration of leucocytes needed in ideal PRP preparation injected in OA What specific type of PRP is ideal for Knee OA Based on the available literature there are some answers and but more questions which need to be answered Different PRP preparations Magalon et al studied five different commercial PRP preparations in a single donor model and noticed significant biological variation in the PRP product among different preparations and postulated this to be a reason for the variability of results in PRP studies variations were observed by Mazzocca et al in the same individual and there were variations in the PRP yield by the same method in samples drawn at different time periods In the debate about fresh PRP versus freeze thawed PRP the fresh PRP appears to be better Storing platelets in freezing conditions can alter the morphology and decrease the functional properties of platelets by degranulation of We had expressed our concerns regarding cryopreservation of PRP in our initial work However freeze thawing PRP is better in terms of patient compliance as the PRP can be prepared in a single sitting Roffi et al studied the effect of freezing thawing on the PRP molecule release and its effects on the metabolism of chondrocytes and synoviocytes They noticed decreased protein level secretion in the freeze thawed PRP but the gene expression in cultured chondroctyes and synoviocytes was similar to that in fresh PRP They concluded that PRP cryopreservation is a safe procedure which sufficiently preserves PRP quality and its ability to induce proliferation and the production of Extra Cellular Matrix components in chondrocytes and synoviocytes For knee OA PRP appears to be better than PRP Clinical studies Over clinical trials have been conducted in the past seven years which reflects the growing interest in exploring PRP as treatment modality in the OA knee It is surprising to notice that in all previous studies series as well as comparative superiority of PRP has been demonstrated in alleviating pain symptoms and improving knee scores Sanchez et al established the safety of autologous PRP for use in the first PRP trial in It was followed by subsequent studies which compared PRP with hyaluronic acid and demonstrated the safety profile and beneficial effects of PRP in the OA knee Spakova et al compared three PRP injections with three hyaluronic acid injections in their randomized control trial on patients and concluded the effectiveness and safety of autologous PRP in early osteoarthritis knee and Lawrence Grades or Better Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores and Numerical Rating Scale were noted in the autologous PRP group in comparison to the HA group Cerza et al in their RCT on patients compared four PRP injections at interval with low molecular weight hyaluronan and observed better improvement of WOMAC scores at weeks in the PRP group They did not find any correlation with the grade of OA Kon et al treated patients with three PRP injections at intervals thawed and noted improvement at six and months from baseline in International Knee Documentation Committee and visual analogue scale scores with a tendency of worsening between six and months In a subsequent comparative study Kon et al observed better symptom control and sustained effects IKDC and in autologous PRP group injections at compared to high molecular weight hyaluronan injections and injections They have established good outcomes of PRP in early degenerative cartilage lesions They have quoted on better results in younger patients low body mass index patients and those with less degree of cartilage degeneration They also followed the same patients for two years and noticed sustained improvement compared to baseline in the PRP group than HA with a slight worsening after the first year However in their recent RCT they found a similar benefit in both HA and PRP groups in early OA Sanchez et al in their RCT of patients with Ahlbacks grade OA compared three PRP injections at intervals with those of The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients having a decrease in the WOMAC pain subscore The secondary outcome measures being other WOMAC subscores Lequesne index and Osteoarthritis Research Society International responders They noticed better outcomes in the PRP group at weeks in respect to primary outcome No differences for secondary outcome measures and amount of acetaminophen consumption were observed Similarly better outcomes were documented in the PRP group in comparison to HA groups at six months by Li et al and Say et al in their prospective studies Patel et al were the first to compare normal saline with PRP and established the superiority of PRP over placebo as manifested by improved WOMAC scores which were sustained at six months They noticed that patients were experiencing benefits as early as days and also noted a slight worsening of benefits by six months based on which they hypothesized that role could be the reason for the clinical effect as for chondral remodelling it would have required much more time and would have given much sustained results There is also a lot of confusion regarding the dosage schedule of PRP for OA knees Initial studies used three injections at three weekly interval any rational probably in a bid to compare with HA which is used similarly The literature is confusing with studies available which have used two injections three injections to four injections The duration between injections is also variable week to four We were the first to compare two different PRP injection groups and found that single injection was as good as two injections of PRP shown by similar improvement in WOMAC scores Recently et al in their randomized trial noted a statistically significant improvement in the IKDC and scores in all the treatment groups compared with the control group The knee scores of patients treated with three PRP injections were significantly better than those patients of single PRP and HA groups Another alternative is to use PRP at yearly intervals or when the patient demands it again after the effect wanes out Gobbi et al have used PRP at yearly interval and established the clinical efficacy A lot more research in this direction needs to be carried out as to how long we can prolong the status with multiple yearly injections Hart et al have used another interesting approach in their trial wherein they compared PRP with mesocaine in knee articular damage grade and grade and The PRP group received a total of nine injections within a year The first six injections at weekly interval followed by a followed by three injections at three month interval They noticed a better improvement of PRP groups at months with respect to IKDC Tegner Lysholm and Cincinnati scores However no significant influence on cartilage was observed in magnetic resonance imaging So no clear benefit of such PRP loaded procedure could be validated Hassan et al looked at patients with mild to moderate OA giving mL PRP at monthly intervals for six months they noticed significant improvement in knee stiffness IKDC scores and VAS scores compared to baseline Maximal improvement was obtained in patients with young age less BMI and short disease duration Majority of the previous studies have included early OA for PRP therapy and consistently showed benefits in terms of symptomatic improvement Kon et al and Hassan et al have compared early OA with late OA and found better results in early OA Recently et al and his team have described a novel approach of PRP delivery in severe OA by intraosseous infiltration of PRP in subchondral area of femoral condyle tibial condyle and patella They also simultaneously gave injections of PRP for addressing synovial and cartilage pathology in OA Another interesting approach towards PRP administration in OA is the use of PRP Paterson et al in a randomized controlled pilot study observed the safety profile and feasibility of use of in OA knee Better scores were observed in comparison with the HA group However studies are required to compare the with PRP to show any additional effect of over conventional PRP There have been a few studies demonstrating the PRP efficacy over HA in hip OA et al demonstrated better outcomes in the PRP group at weeks in talar osteochondral lesions With the availability of commercial PRP kits in market more and more people can receive the treatment However it is advisable for the clinicians to not get carried away with the initial results and to keep track of the outcome so as to contribute to the existing literature It is also advisable to look at the yield and the product obtained to classify the PRP type Anitua et al had postulated that PRP in combination with HA may be synergistic by enhancing the migratory potential of fibroblast based on her in vitro studies The same has also been supported by Marmotti et al in his in vitro study Both HA and PRP are biological approaches and their use may be critical in the initial phase of OA environment where tissue healing may benefit Based on these concepts Andia et al have expressed that may be better than PRP alone Dallari et al in their RCT in hip primary OA compared ultrasound guided injections of PRP HA and and noticed a significant improvement in WOMAC and Harris Hip score in the PRP group over HA However the addition of did not lead to significant improvement in pain symptoms A recent RCT by Lana et al compared versus PRP versus HA in mild to moderate knee OA and noticed better outcomes in the combination over HA alone up to one year and over PRP alone up to three months They also noted better functional outcomes in the first days after treatment in the combination group over HA and PRP alone groups Clinical studies on combination therapy are limited and further studies with a larger sample size are required before a definitive comment can made Several key aspects concerning molecular weight ideal combination and dosage schedule of both need to be evaluated before conducting clinical trials definitely seems like a good future option Conclusion The present state of knowledge holds promise for PRP of certain specifications for pain management in the early OA knee PRP has consistently been shown by various clinical studies to be superior to HA Nevertheless a lot of grey areas remain in our understanding of PRP and OA and many more focused clinical and in vitro studies are required seems to be an evolving future trend Researchers are also focused on developing a better PRP product by combining it with various molecules such as gelatin chitosan and others PRP is definitely there to stay for OA therapy use in future Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest in relation with this paper Boswell SG Cole BJ Sundman EA et al plasma a

which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited Treatment of painful internal snapping hip via arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon is becoming the preferred option over open techniques because of the benefits of minimal dissection and fewer complications However complications do occur with arthroscopic techniques as well We present the case of a woman who presented with painful internal snapping of her right hip and underwent arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon Following the procedure she continued to complain of pain in her groin and was therefore investigated further with a magnetic resonance imaging which revealed a swelling near the femoral circumflex vessels A computed tomography angiogram revealed a mm pseudoaneurysm of the femoral circumflex artery which was successfully treated by selective catheterisation and embolisation Hip arthroscopists should be sufficiently familiar with the vascular anatomy around the hip and keep this complication in mind when releasing the iliopsoas tendon arthroscopically especially in revision cases with adhesions Pseudoaneurysm Femoral circumflex artery Arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release Iliopsoas snapping Embolisation Introduction Internal snapping of the hip occurs when the iliopsoas tendon snaps over the iliopectineal eminence or across the femoral head as the hip is brought from flexion abduction and external rotation to extension If treatment which includes physiotherapy to stretch the muscle fails then open or arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon has been described as being effective in relieving the snapping sensation reducing pain and restoring function Complications from open procedures such as transient sensory loss in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh have been reported to occur with high frequency thus arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon was introduced as an adjunct to hip arthroscopy for operative treatment of this problem Arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas consists of dividing the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas between the level of the acetabulum and the lesser trochanter which leads to functional lengthening of the musculotendinous unit while leaving the muscle belly intact and it has been shown to effectively alleviate pain associated with internal snapping of the hip Except for persistent snapping after release complications following arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon have not been reported thus far In this report we present a rare case of a pseudoaneurysm which occurred in the femoral circumflex artery after arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon Case presentation A woman was referred to our tertiary young adult hip service for evaluation of right hip pain which had been affecting her for over six months along with mechanical symptoms of snapping She had undergone an arthroscopy of her hip previously for an acetabular labral tear and recovered well following the same She did not report of any definite history of injury which had led to the onset of her symptoms The examination of her right hip revealed that she had a normal gait and flexion was limited to Internal rotation in flexion was limited to and external rotation in flexion was The impingement test was positive and there was definite snapping palpable in the groin on extending her hip from a flexed and abducted position which was painful Dorsalis pedis was well palpable Plain radiographs did not reveal any signs of dysplasia and showed a joint space A dynamic ultrasound scan showed that the iliopsoas tendon snapped as she extended her hip from flexed and externally rotated position Physiotherapy to stretch her iliopsoas and an ultrasound guided injection of steroid was not quite successful and since she was quite symptomatic revision arthroscopic intervention was planned At arthroscopy the labrum was frayed and therefore debrided but was stable and the iliopsoas was released from the peripheral compartment via the transcapsular approach Whilst dissecting the iliopsoas tendon a gush of blood was found and the oozing channel was coagulated with the radiofrequency probe After min of the pressure dressing there was no further ooze found There was also no evidence of any distal vascular deficit and the Doppler showed a good pulse at the dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibial artery However two weeks following the procedure she still had an uncomfortable feeling in her right hip A magnetic resonance imaging scan was arranged which showed a mm reasonably focus of abnormal signal immediately medial to the psoas tendon just proximal to its insertion which was consistent with a haematoma An angiogram showed that there was a mm pseudoaneurysm in the right groin which arose from a circumflex femoral branch that arose directly from the posterior aspect of the femoral circumflex artery immediately proximal to the profunda bifurcation Figure She underwent selective catheterisation and embolisation with micro coils Figure The aneurysm was accessed from the left common femoral artery by retrograde puncture and sheath was used Following embolisation she was asymptomatic and a repeat computed tomography Figure and MRI showed satisfactory embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm with preservation of perfusion of the surrounding muscles Figure An angiogram of A mm pseudoaneurysm which arose from a circumflex femoral branch that arose directly from the posterior aspect of the femoral circumflex artery is shown Figure An angiogram of A pseudoaneurysm was embolised with micro coils Figure A CT appearance of and A pseudoaneurysm was embolised with micro coils Discussion We present a rare case of a pseudoaneurysm following arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon for painful iliopsoas snapping Although arthroscopy has been thought of as a relatively safe procedure it is not free of complications An endoscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon can be done at the level of the hip capsule via the central or peripheral compartments or at its attachment at the lesser trochanter The posterior surface of the iliopsoas muscle and tendon is in close contact with the anterior capsule of the hip This close relationship allows performing an iliopsoas tenotomy from the peripheral compartment of the hip The femoral circumflex artery consists of two branches medial femoral circumflex artery and lateral femoral circumflex artery The MFCA has its origin from the deep femoral artery of the femoral artery The MFCA usually has five branches ascending descending acetabular superficial and deep The deep branch of the MFCA is the one which is the most responsible for the vascularisation of the femoral head and neck It has its origin medially from the femoral artery between the pectineus and iliopsoas tendons along the inferior border of externus obturator muscle The LFCA arises from the lateral side of the deep femoral artery in most of the cases From this point it goes to a lateral position just behind the sartorius and rectus femoris and between the divisions of the femoral nerve At this level it gives origin to the ascending transverse and descending branches Figure Figure Arteries around the proximal femur Iliopsoas muscle profunda femoris artery medial femoral circumflex artery lateral femoral circumflex artery ascending branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery transverse branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery descending branch of lateral femoral circumflex artery In this current case adhesions around the hip joint due to the previous arthroscopy could have contributed to the tethering of the vessels around the zona orbicularis leading to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm It should also be noted that a vessel is not the only structure which could be damaged during arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon Some branches of the femoral nerve lie directly over the anterior surface of the iliopsoas muscle These branches are at risk when a release of the iliopsoas tendon is performed although in a more distal position they are protected by the presence of the iliopsoas bursa and the vastus intermedius Hip arthroscopists should bear the possibility of adhesions and these complications especially when performing revision hip however it is not difficult to comprehend that such a complication could happen even during an open procedure As a conclusion we present a rare case of a pseudoaneurysm which occurred in the femoral circumflex artery after revision arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon Hip arthroscopists should bear this complication in mind when releasing the snapping iliopsoas tendon arthroscopically especially in the background of adhesions in revision cases Conflict of interest NN LL and VK certify that they have no financial conflict of interest in connection with this article Flanum ME Keene JS Blankenbaker DG Desmet AA

with these terms The recent learning in artificial neural networks had strong impact and widespread deployment for engineering applications but the use of deep learning for neurocomputational modeling has been so far limited In this article we argue that unsupervised deep learning represents an important step forward for improving neurocomputational models of perception and cognition because it emphasizes the role of generative learning as opposed to discriminative learning As a case study we present a series of simulations investigating the emergence of neural coding of visual space for sensorimotor transformations We compare different network architectures commonly used as building blocks for unsupervised deep learning by systematically testing the type of receptive fields and gain modulation developed by the hidden neurons In particular we compare Restricted Boltzmann Machines which are stochastic generative networks with bidirectional connections trained using contrastive divergence with autoencoders which are deterministic networks trained using error backpropagation For both learning architectures we also explore the role of sparse coding which has been identified as a fundamental principle of neural computation The unsupervised models are then compared with supervised networks that learn an explicit mapping between different spatial reference frames Our simulations show that both architectural and learning constraints strongly influenced the emergent coding of visual space in terms of distribution of tuning functions at the level of single neurons Unsupervised models and particularly RBMs were found to more closely adhere to neurophysiological data from recordings in the primate parietal cortex These results provide new insights into how basic properties of artificial neural networks might be relevant for modeling neural information processing in biological systems connectionist modeling unsupervised deep learning restricted Boltzmann machines autoencoders sparseness space coding gain modulation sensorimotor transformations European Research Council degli Studi di Padova Introduction Artificial neural network models aim at explaining human cognition and behavior in terms of the emergent consequences of a large number of simple subcognitive processes et al Within this framework the pattern seen in overt behavior dynamics of the reflects the coordinated operations of simple biophysical mechanisms dynamics of the such as the propagation of activation and inhibition among elementary processing units Though this general tenet is shared by all connectionist models there is large variability in processing architectures and learning algorithms which turns into varying degrees of psychological and biological realism g Thorpe and Imbert O Reilly When the aim is to investigate cognitive functions simplification is essential and the underlying processing mechanisms do not need to faithfully implement the neuronal circuits supposed to carry out such functions in the brain However modelers should strive to consider biological plausibility if this can bridge different levels of description and Zorzi Recent theoretical and technical progress in artificial neural networks has significantly expanded the range of tasks that can be solved by machine intelligence In particular the advent of powerful parallel computing architectures based on Graphic Processing Units coupled with the availability of data has allowed to create and train hierarchical neural networks known as deep neural networks et al for These powerful learning systems achieve impressive performance in many challenging cognitive tasks such as visual object recognition et al speech processing et al and natural language understanding et al However while the impact of deep learning for engineering applications is undisputed its relevance for modeling neural information processing in biological systems still needs to be fully evaluated seminal attempts see Stoianov and Zorzi and Kriegeskorte and van Gerven One critical aspect of most deep learning systems is the reliance on a architecture trained with error backpropagation et al which has been repeatedly shown to yield performance in a variety of problems et al However the assumptions that learning is largely discriminative g classification or function and that an external teaching signal is always available at each learning event e all training data is are clearly implausible from both a cognitive and a biological perspective et al Cox and Dean Reinforcement learning is a valuable alternative and it has already shown promising results when combined with deep learning et al Silver et al but there is a broad range of situations where learning seems to be fully unsupervised and its only objective is that of discovering the latent structure of the input data in order to build rich internal representations of the environment and Sejnowski We argue that more realistic neurocognitive models should therefore also exploit unsupervised forms of deep learning where the objective is not to explicitly classify the input patterns but rather to discover internal representations by fitting a hierarchical generative model to the sensory data Zorzi et al Compared to its supervised counterpart this modeling approach emphasizes the role of feedback recurrent connections et al which carry expectations that are gradually adjusted to better reflect the observed data and Ghahramani Friston and which can be used to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the whole cortical hierarchy and Mumford Gilbert and Sigman Notably processing is also relevant for understanding attentional mechanisms in terms of modulation of neural information processing and Ungerleider A powerful class of stochastic neural networks that learn a generative model of the data is that of Restricted Boltzmann Machines which can efficiently discover internal representations e latent using learning mechanisms RBMs constitute the building block of hierarchical generative models such as Deep Belief Networks and Salakhutdinov and Deep Boltzmann Machines These unsupervised deep learning models have been successfully used to simulate a variety of cognitive functions such as numerosity perception and Zorzi letter perception et al under visual word recognition Bono and Zorzi and visual hallucinations in psychiatric syndromes et al A similar approach has been used to simulate how early visual cortical representations are adapted to statistical regularities in natural images in order to predict single voxel responses to natural images and identify images from multiple voxel responses and van Gerven A temporal extension of RBMs has also been recently used to model sequential orthographic processing and spontaneous pseudoword generation et al Unsupervised deep learning can be implemented using an alternative architecture based on autoencoders et al which are deterministic networks whose learning goal is to accurately reconstruct the input data into a separate layer of output units autoencoders are trained using error backpropagation and can be stacked in order to build more complex architectures However despite the common view that RBMs and autoencoders could be considered equivalent et al we note that their underlying architectural and learning assumptions are significantly different In this study we empirically compare RBMs and autoencoders in terms of the type of internal encoding emerging in the hidden neurons Moreover we investigate how additional learning constraints such as sparsity and limitation of computational resources e hidden layer could influence the representations developed by the networks As a case study we focus on the problem of learning visuospatial coding for sensorimotor transformations which is a prominent example of how the emergentist approach based on learning in artificial neural networks has offered important insights into the computations performed by biological neurons and Andersen Sensorimotor transformations refer to the process by which sensory stimuli are converted into motor commands For example reaching requires to map visual information represented in retinal coordinates into a system of coordinates that is centered on the effector Coordinate transformations can be accomplished by combining sensory information with information such as postural signals representing the position of eyes head or hand thereby obtaining abstract representations of the space interposed between the sensory input and the motor output and Snyder recordings from monkey posterior parietal cortex have shown that the response amplitude of many neurons indeed depends on the position of the eyes thereby unveiling a fundamental coding principle used to perform this type of signal integration et al The term gain field was coined to describe this response of parietal neurons and since then the notion of gain modulation has been generalized to indicate the multiplicative control of one neuron s responses by the responses of another set of neurons and Thier Another fundamental property unveiled by neuronal recordings is that the encoding of space used for coordinate transformations involves a variety of different complementary frames of reference For example although many parietal neurons are centered on retinal coordinates et al Duhamel et al others represent space using et al or et al coordinate systems Moreover some neurons exhibit multiple gain modulation et al suggesting more complex forms of spatial coding For example postural information related to both eye and head positions can be combined in order to encode direction et al Stricanne et al Duhamel et al From a computational perspective the seminal work of Zipser and Andersen showed that gain modulation could spontaneously emerge in supervised neural networks trained to explicitly map visual targets into coordinates giving as input any arbitrary pair of eye and retinal positions Similar results have been observed using more learning settings such as reinforcement learning et al and predictive coding Meyer and Spratling Note that these learning settings assume that gain modulation emerges because the task implies to establish a mapping between different reference frames However it is unclear whether the form of modulation and the distribution of neuronal tuning functions is influenced by the type of learning algorithm and or by the nature of the learning task e learning mappings vs unsupervised learning of internal We also note that a popular alternative framework for modeling sensorimotor transformations is not based on learning but rather stipulates that parietal neurons represent a set of basis functions that combine visual and postural information review see Pouget and Snyder In summary space coding represents an interesting case study for testing the adequacy of different neural network architectures and learning algorithms because it provides a wealth of neurophysiological data at the population and and it departs from the classic problem of visual object recognition investigated in the large majority of deep learning research Materials and methods In this section we describe the space coding tasks used in our simulations including training and test stimuli the different learning architectures and the procedures for analyzing the emergent neural representations Space coding tasks In this study we consider a visual signal in retinotopic coordinates and two different postural signals one for eye position and another for a generic which might represent for example the position of the hand We do not consider the integration between different modalities Xing and Andersen for a computational investigation of multimodal integration in several coordinate We implemented three types of space coding tasks to test the different learning architectures Unsupervised learning with no coordinate transformation The first learning architecture is depicted in Figure Unsupervised learning is represented by undirected arrows which connect the sensory input to a separate layer of hidden neurons The input signal to the network consists of a visual map which represents target location in retinotopic coordinates and two postural maps which represent eye and effector positions The learning goal is only to build a compact representation of these input signals in the hidden layer which is later by a simple linear associator in order to establish a mapping with the corresponding motor program Details of input and output representations are provided in Section Dataset and Stimuli The unsupervised learning phase does not involve any coordinate transformation because information about the motor program is not available Figure Graphical representations of the learning architectures used to simulate the space coding tasks Undirected edges entail bidirectional connections while directed arrows represent connections Unsupervised learning with no coordinate transformation Unsupervised learning with coordinate transformation Supervised learning with coordinate transformation Unsupervised learning with coordinate transformation The second learning architecture is depicted in Figure The input signal to the network still consists of a visual map and two postural maps but in this case we also provide as input the corresponding motor program In this setting the unsupervised learning phase implicitly involves coordinate transformation e different coordinate systems become In order to compare the mapping accuracy of different learning architectures using the same method the motor program is still from hidden neurons via a simple linear associator Supervised learning with coordinate transformation The third learning architecture is depicted in Figure and it corresponds to the model used by Zipser and Andersen The input is the same of the unsupervised architecture shown in Figure but in this case supervised learning is used to establish an explicit mapping between input signals and motor programs As for the previous architectures accuracy of the motor program is also tested by from hidden neurons via linear association Dataset and stimuli The representation format adopted for the sensory stimuli was the same used in previous computational investigations and Andersen Pouget and Snyder De Filippo De Grazia et al which is broadly consistent with neurophysiological data recorded in animals performing tasks involving coordinate transformations g Andersen et al The visual input to the models consisted in a vector representing the position of the stimulus as a Gaussian peak of activity in a specific location These visible neurons simulate the activity of the cortical areas supplying retinotopic sensory information to the posterior parietal cortex The retinotopic map consisted in a square matrix of neurons which employed a population code with Gaussian tuning functions deviation Visual receptive fields were uniformly spread between and with increments of both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions Four postural maps each one consisting of neurons were used to represent the horizontal and vertical positions of the eye and the effector These visible neurons used a sigmoid activation function parameter to represent postural information between and with steps of The motor program consisted in a vector representing the target position of the stimulus Similarly to the retinotopic map it was coded as a square matrix of neurons which employed a population code with Gaussian tuning functions to represent target position in coordinates centered on the effector deviation Motor programs were uniformly spread between and with increments of both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions In order to create the stimuli dataset all possible combinations of visual input and postural signals were first generated and the corresponding motor program was computed We then balanced the patterns to ensure that target locations were equally distributed across the motor map to avoid position biases when decoding the motor program This resulted in a total of patterns which were randomly split into a training set and an independent test set The latter was used to assess the generalization performance of the models Learning architectures Despite they differ in several aspects Boltzmann machines and autoencoders can both be defined within the mathematical framework of models et al where the learning objective is to carve the surface of an energy function so as to minimize the energies of training points and maximize the energies of unobserved points A set of latent variables is used to learn an internal code that can efficiently represent the observed data points and since the number of latent variables is usually smaller than that of the observed variables the encoding process can be interpreted as a form of dimensionality reduction and Salakhutdinov In this unsupervised setting the model learns the statistical structure of the data without the need for any explicit external label Restricted boltzmann machines Boltzmann machines are stochastic neural networks that use a set of hidden neurons to model the latent causes of the observed data vectors which are presented to the network through a set of visible neurons et al In the case the network connectivity is constrained in order to obtain a bipartite graph e there are no connections within the same see Figure for a graphical The behavior of the network is driven by an energy function E which defines the joint distribution of the hidden and visible neurons by assigning a probability value to each of their possible configurations p v h e E v h Z where v and h are the column vectors containing the values of visible and hidden neurons respectively and Z is the partition function The energy function is defined as a linear combination of visible and hidden neurons activation E v h b T v c T h h T W v where W is the matrix of connections weights b and c are two additional parameters known as unit biases and T denotes the transpose operator Since there are no connections within the same layer hidden neurons are conditionally independent given the state of visible neurons vice In particular the activation probability of the neurons in each layer conditioned on the activation of the neurons in the opposite layer can be efficiently computed in one parallel step P h j v c j i w i j v i P v i h b i j w i j h j where is the sigmoid function c j and b i are the biases of hidden and visible neurons h j and v i and w ij is the connection weight between h j and v i Learning in RBMs can be performed through where each weight should be changed at each step according to a learning rule W v h v h where represents the learning rate v h are the correlations computed on the training data and v h are the correlations computed according to the model s expectations Model s expectations have been traditionally computed by running Gibbs sampling algorithms until the network reached equilibrium et al However more efficient algorithms such as contrastive divergence learning by approximating the gradient The reader is referred to Hinton and Zorzi et al for more details about RBMs and for the discussion of of the learning algorithm Figure Graphical representations of the different learning architectures used in the simulations Restricted Boltzmann Machine the learning objective is to accurately reconstruct the input patterns presented through the visible layer v by relying on a set of hidden units h which represent the latent structure of the data The reconstruction is performed by using a weight matrix W that contains symmetric e connections Autoencoder as for RBMs the learning objective is to accurately reconstruct the input patterns presented through the visible layer v by relying on a set of hidden units h However the reconstruction is performed on a separate layer of units by using two weight matrices W and W that contain directed connections supervised network in contrast to RBMs and autoencoders the learning objective is to minimize the mapping error between the input patterns presented through the visible layer v and a distinct set of output patterns presented through a dedicated layer out In our simulations RBMs were trained using contrastive divergence with a learning rate of a weight decay of and a momentum coefficient of which was initialized to for the first few epochs Learning was performed using a scheme with a size of patterns for a total of learning epochs error always Sparse representations were encouraged by forcing the network s internal representations to rely on a limited number of active hidden units that is by driving the probability q of a unit to be active to a certain desired probability p et al For logistic units this can be practically implemented by first calculating the quantity which is then multiplied by a scaling factor and added to the biases of each hidden units at every weight update When the sparsity constraint was applied we always verified that the average activation of hidden units was indeed maintained below the desired level All the simulations were performed using an efficient implementation of RBMs on graphic processors et al The complete source code is available for download Autoencoders Similarly to RBMs autoencoders rely on a single layer of nonlinear hidden units to compactly represent the statistical regularities of the training data However autoencoders are deterministic networks trained with error backpropagation et al The training data is presented to a layer of input units and the learning goal is to accurately reconstruct such input vector into a separate output layer An autoencoder is therefore composed of a set of encoding weights W that are used to compute the activation of hidden h units given the activation of input units v and a set of decoding weights W that are used to compute the network reconstructions from the activations of hidden units h W v c v r e c W h b where b and c are the vectors of output and hidden unit biases and is the sigmoid function Figure for a graphical The error function E to be minimized corresponds to the average reconstruction error which is quantified by the sum across all output units of the squared difference between the original and the reconstructed values E N n N k K v k v r e c k s p a r s i t y where K is the number of output units and N is the number of training patterns Similarly to RBMs sparse representations can be induced by adding to the cost function a regularization term sparsity that takes a large value when the average activation value q of each hidden neuron diverges from a certain desired value p In particular the sparsity constraint was implemented as the divergence from q to p s p a r s i t y i H K L p q i where H is the number of hidden units As for RBMs when sparsity was applied we always verified that the average activation of hidden units was indeed maintained below the desired level In our simulations we used an efficient implementation of autoencoders provided by the MATLAB Neural Network toolbox and Beale Learning was performed using standard scaled conjugate gradient descent with adaptive learning rate using a weight decay factor of and a batch processing scheme for a total of learning epochs error always supervised networks In order to better assess the impact of the learning regimen we compared the unsupervised learning architectures described above with a standard supervised architecture implemented as a network with one hidden layer and Andersen Similarly to autoencoders learning can be performed using error backpropagation Figure for a graphical We used an efficient implementation of networks provided by the MATLAB Neural Network toolbox Learning rate was set to and training was performed for a total of learning epochs error always Testing procedure For each experimental setting we run different networks in order to collect simulation statistics In the results we therefore always report mean values along with standard deviations Decoding internal representations by linear Following unsupervised learning a linear was performed from the internal distributed representations of the networks in order to assess how well they could support a supervised mapping to the target motor program through a simple linear projection and Snyder The was implemented using a linear neural network trained with the delta rule and Hoff Learning was performed for epochs using of patterns Learning rate was set to and weight decay of was used as a regularizer Classifier performance was always measured on the separate test set Test errors always matched those obtained on the training set indicating that the was robust to overfitting The output of the classifier was first compared with the target motor program by computing the Root Mean Squared Error between the two matrices However a more useful performance measure was obtained by first decoding the Center Of Mass of the output distribution which was then compared with the actual coordinates of the motor program This measure allows to quantify the error in degrees following Zipser and Andersen the mapping was considered to be successful if the error was below the distance between the centers of the Gaussian tuning functions in the retinotopic map e If the latter mapping accuracy was not achieved we did not consider the network for subsequent analyses We found the RMSE and COM measures to be always consistent with each other so we only report COM results Measuring and population sparseness An index of sparseness was computed using a procedure employed in neurophysiological investigations and Tovee Vinje and Gallant which describes the activity fraction a of each neuron across stimuli as a r i n r i n where r i is the firing rate of the neuron to the i stimulus in the set of n stimuli This is a useful measure of the extent of the tail of the distribution in this case of the firing rates of the neuron to each stimulus Mean sparseness for each network was then calculated by averaging the activity fraction a across all hidden neurons A low value value is maximum value is indicates that the distribution has a long tail which means that on average each neuron has high activation levels only for a small subset of input patterns This method for quantifying sparseness has a number of advantages and Tovee it results from formal analyses of the capacity of neural networks using an approach derived from theoretical physics and Rolls it can be applied both to binary neurons and to neurons with continuous firing it makes no assumption about the form of the firing rate distribution and it makes no assumption about the mean and the variance of the firing rate Following Froudarakis et al we also computed an index of population sparseness on which the activity fraction is computed over the entire hidden layer that is by considering r i as the firing rate of the i neuron and n as the total number of neurons Mean population sparseness for each network was then calculated by averaging the activity fraction a across all stimuli A low value of population sparseness indicates that on average each stimulus elicits high activations only for a small subset of hidden neurons Receptive fields emerging in the hidden neurons In order to qualitatively assess the type of visual features extracted by individual hidden neurons we first analyzed the weight matrices by separately plotting the strengths of the connections between each hidden neuron and all the visible neurons corresponding to the retinal input Weights were plotted on a gray scale with dark colors indicating strong inhibitory connections and light colors representing positive excitatory connections This allowed to assess whether hidden neurons learned receptive fields for example by developing stronger projections to specific regions of the visual field Gain modulation indexes We then analyzed the response of hidden neurons using a standard approach adopted in neurophysiological studies to assess gain modulation in parietal neurons et al First we probed the hidden neurons in order to only select the ones that is those responding to the portion of input vectors representing the retinotopic map Filippo De Grazia et al To this aim we first recorded all hidden neurons activations when the network received as input only all possible combinations of eye and effector positions e the retinotopic map and if present the motor program were set to and for each neuron we selected the positions corresponding to maximum activation We then probed again each neuron this time providing as input all possible retinotopic signals along with the preferred combination of postural signals The neuron was considered as visual if its maximum activity differed by more than from that recorded in the absence of visual input neurons were discarded from subsequent analyses We then computed a gain modulation index for each neuron by recording its response to each target location as a function of eye and effector position and Snyder We first identified the combination of postural and retinal input producing the maximum neuron activation value Starting from this input combination we systematically varied each postural variable at a time keeping all the others and computed gain modulation as the normalized ratio between the maximum and minimum activation values Therefore each neuron was characterized by four different GMIs representing the gain for each postural variable with respect to horizontal and vertical axes We finally sorted all hidden neurons into four different categories based on the combination of GMI indexes a threshold of to establish no modulation e purely visual modulation by eye position only modulation by effector position only and modulation by both eye and effector position Results Learning always converged for all models For unsupervised models convergence was monitored by measuring the mean reconstruction error on the whole training set Autoencoders required more learning epochs to converge but also achieved a lower reconstruction error compared to RBMs This is probably due to the fact that autoencoders are natively Existing extensions of RBMs et al assume that the input values are normally distributed which was not our case so we preferred to use standard RBMs Learning in the supervised models required almost times more epochs to converge number of epochs required by each learning architecture is reported in Table Table errors for each learning architecture and space coding task as a function of hidden layer size Space coding task Layer size RBMs Autoencoders Supervised Epochs Epochs Epochs No transformation Coordinate transformation errors are in degrees and standard deviations are reported in parentheses The column shows the number of epochs required by each learning architecture to converge A first qualitative analysis shows that RBMs and autoencoders developed different types of receptive fields As shown in Figure autoencoders learned homogeneous receptive fields that uniformly covered the central regions of the visual input On the other hand while some neurons in the RBMs learned receptive fields resembling those of autoencoders other neurons developed more complex receptive fields covering larger regions of the visual fields sometimes also simultaneously covering symmetrical portions of the input image Figure Visual receptive fields Samples of receptive fields emerging from RBMs and autoencoders on the unsupervised learning task that did not require coordinate transformations Similar receptive fields emerged from the unsupervised learning task involving coordinate transformations The quantitative analyses Section Testing allowed to group hidden neurons into different categories according to their response profiles In line with empirical findings et al there were always some neurons that did not exhibit any form of gain modulation e that is they responded to visual stimuli at a given spatial location regardless of or positions However the majority of neurons developed gain fields which in some cases were modulated exclusively by either eye or effector position for example top panels of Figure while in other cases were modulated by both eye and effector position resulting in multiple gain fields panels of Figure Figure Gain field coding Examples of single and multiple gain fields emerging in the hidden neurons of RBMs and autoencoders Colors represent the amount of activation with yellow indicating highest activation and dark blue indicating lowest activation Single gain fields are characterized by a modulation of the neuron s activation that depends only on one postural signal the figure effector position for the RBM and eye position for the In multiple gain fields the activation is modulated by both signals Unsupervised learning without coordinate transformation In a first set of simulations the number of hidden units was fixed to while the sparsity constraint was varied between strong sparsity constraint requiring low average and sparsity As shown in Figure the effect of sparsity constraints on the two unsupervised architectures was markedly different Levels of sparsity constraints in the first two rows are represented using a color scale where lighter tones indicate stronger sparsity and dark tones indicate mild sparsity Gain modulation in RBMs was not affected by imposing sparsity constraints In all cases we found a modest percentage of purely visual neurons which were not modulated by any postural information A more consistent percentage of neurons were modulated either by eye or by effector positions while the remaining neurons exhibited multiple gain fields accuracy was always good except for the networks trained with very strong sparsity constraints and where learning failed and accuracy did not achieve a mean error lower than The lowest error was obtained with a sparsity constraint of In contrast autoencoders were extremely sensitive to sparsity constraints Strong sparsity constraints resulted in a compressed code where the majority of hidden neurons exhibited multiple gain fields When the sparsity pressure was reduced gain fields gradually disappeared and the majority of neurons did not exhibit any modulation at all error was generally lower compared to RBMs and learning failed only for the networks trained with extreme or without any sparsity constraints Notably also for autoencoders the lowest error was obtained with a sparsity constraint of which also resulted in a distribution of gain fields more similar to that of RBMs Figure Effect of sparsity constraints Distribution of gain field types emerging in the hidden neurons of RBMs and autoencoders with varying levels of sparsity constraint Sparsity constraints are represented in different columns using a color scale where lighter tones indicate stronger sparsity constraints and dark red indicates mild sparsity constraints errors obtained at each level of sparsity constraint for RBMs and autoencoders and population sparseness as a function of sparsity constraints for RBMs and autoencoders Note that small values indicate stronger sparseness Interestingly the objective indexes of sparseness revealed that RBMs are naturally much sparser than autoencoders bottom panels of Figure Indeed the level of sparsity constraint turned out to have a very weak effect on population sparseness in RBMs as also confirmed by linear regression r b p n sparseness was only affected when the sparsity constraint operated below a critical level of In order to measure what would be the index of sparseness in RBMs we trained an additional set of networks without imposing any sparsity constraint which resulted in a sparseness of and a population sparseness of showing that RBMs naturally exhibit a remarkable sparseness In contrast sparsity constraints in autoencoders had a marked effect on both sparseness and population sparseness suggesting that this architecture naturally develops extremely distributed internal representations In particular the effect of level of sparsity constraint on population sparseness for autoencoders regression r b p n was almost one order of magnitude higher compared to RBMs In order to measure the spontaneous index of sparseness in autoencoders we trained an additional set of networks with a very low sparsity constraint which is the borderline condition that still guaranteed successful learning The latter simulations yielded sparseness values indicating highly distributed representations sparseness population sparseness In a second set of simulations the sparsity constraint for both architectures was fixed to the value leading to the best performance while the size of the hidden layer was varied systematically between and neurons in steps of This range allowed to explore the effect of relatively large increases and decreases of hidden layer sizes with respect to the previous simulations without compromising the learning accuracy For both architectures the accuracy was not affected by hidden layer size and the mapping error was always below errors for all different hidden layer sizes are reported in Table However as shown in Figure also in this case the manipulation had different effects for the two architectures colors indicate smaller The type of encoding developed by RBMs was affected by hidden layer size When the number of hidden neurons decreased the network developed more compressed codes by increasing the percentage of multiple gain fields and reducing the percentage of neurons modulated by only eye or effector positions Interestingly it turned out that the manipulation of hidden layer size had a clear impact also on the underlying sparseness of the representation Indeed both and population sparseness decreased as a function of number of hidden neurons regressions sparseness r b p n population sparseness r b p n This result suggests that the distribution of gain fields in RBMs might in fact be modulated by the underlying sparseness of the representation This was confirmed by the high correlation between the percentage of multiple and the objective sparseness indexes correlations sparseness r p population sparseness r p Figure Effect of hidden layer size with strong sparsity constraint Distribution of gain field types emerging at the hidden layer of RBMs and autoencoders with varying number of hidden neurons and sparsity constraint fixed to Lighter tones indicate smaller layers and dark blue indicates larger layers and population sparseness as a function of hidden layer size for RBMs and autoencoders Note that small values indicate stronger sparseness On the contrary neuronal tuning functions in autoencoders were not affected by hidden layer size as this architecture always developed uniformly distributed types of gain fields Interestingly as for RBMs the reduction of hidden layer size caused a decrease in both sparseness and population sparseness regressions sparseness r b p n population sparseness r b p n However the sparseness indexes did not correlate with the percentage of multiple p This suggests that similar changes in the underlying sparseness do not produce the same effect on the gain field distribution in RBMs and autoencoders In order to better clarify if the size of the hidden layer in RBMs modulates the distribution of gain fields only when sparseness is externally forced e when using a sparsity constraint of in a subsequent set of simulations the sparsity constraint was set to a weak level and the size of the hidden layer was manipulated as in the previous condition In this case the distribution of gain fields did not systematically change but notably also the population sparseness was not affected regression r b p n Correlation analyses still revealed a correlation between population sparseness and the percentage of multimodal gain fields r p while the correlation with sparseness was not significant p These results show that for RBMs population sparseness is a robust predictor of the distribution of gain fields if RBMs must rely only of few active neurons to represent each sensory stimulus they will develop more compressed spatial codes such as those based on multiple gain fields The corresponding simulation with autoencoders was relatively uninformative because the weak level of sparsity constraint resulted in the absence of multimodal gain fields Figure Effect of hidden layer size with moderate sparsity constraint Distribution of gain field types emerging at the hidden layer of RBMs and autoencoders with varying number of hidden neurons and sparsity constraint fixed to Lighter tones indicate smaller layers and dark blue indicates larger layers and population sparseness as a function of hidden layer size for RBMs and autoencoders Note that small values indicate stronger sparseness Unsupervised learning with coordinate transformation As discussed before in this learning setting the motor program was included as input during unsupervised learning This implies that two different coordinate systems e retinotopic and are implicitly associated during training For these simulations we focused on hidden layer size which was varied between and neurons in steps of Note that the larger number of hidden neurons with respect to the previous simulations is motivated by the increased size and complexity of the training patterns The sparsity constraint was fixed to which was the value resulting in more accurate and more balanced distribution of gain fields for both RBMs and autoencoders in the previous set of simulations For both architectures accuracy was always good error below and it was not affected by hidden layer size Table As shown in Figure RBMs generally developed a larger percentage of gain fields compared to autoencoders In particular the number of multiple gain fields was much higher for RBMs Interestingly for both architectures also in this case the manipulation of hidden layer size produced a systematic change in the sparseness indexes regressions RBMs sparseness r b p n RBMs population sparseness r b p n autoencoders sparseness r b p n autoencoders population sparseness r b p n For both architectures population and sparseness were highly correlated with the percentage of multiple gain fields correlations RBMs sparseness r p RBMs population sparseness r p autoencoders sparseness r p autoencoders population sparseness r p This finding corroborates the hypothesis that especially for RBMs reducing the number of active neurons results in more compressed codes based on multiple gain fields which might be particularly advantageous in the current scenario since learning involved coordinate transformations In contrast fewer neurons in autoencoders exhibited multiple gain modulation even if also in this case the percentage of multiple gain fields was proportional to the underlying level of sparseness Figure Unsupervised learning involving coordinate transformations Distribution of gain field types emerging at the hidden layer of RBMs and autoencoders with varying number of hidden neurons Lighter tones indicate smaller layers and dark blue indicates larger layers and population sparseness as a function of hidden layer size for RBMs and autoencoders Note that small values indicate stronger sparseness Supervised learning with coordinate transformation The final set of simulations reproduced the supervised architecture used by Zipser and Andersen As in their original work we did not enforce sparse coding The size of the hidden layer was varied between and in steps of Learning always converged and both the mapping error and the error were below Table As shown in Figure this type of learning architecture developed a strikingly lower proportion of neurons in the hidden layer Almost of the neurons did not exhibit any form of gain field The remaining ones were almost uniformly distributed across the three other types for either eye or effector for multiple gain Moreover differently from the unsupervised architectures the type of gain modulation was not affected by changes in the hidden layer size This result is remarkable because it suggests that supervised architectures are much less prone to develop efficient forms of space coding based on gain fields One possible explanation for this finding is that the type of coding used to represent the motor program might have affected the efficiency of error backpropagation which was not able to properly propagate the error signals across the hidden layer Indeed also Zipser and Andersen found some discrepancy between the type of gain modulations developed when using a monotonic output format compared to the Gaussian output format was adopted in the present However the previous simulations with autoencoders showed that backpropagation can give rise to a variety of strong gain modulations when it is applied within an unsupervised learning setting Another more critical factor might instead be the absence of sparsity constraints which were not used in the models but turned out to be fundamental with autoencoders Figure Supervised learning of coordinate transformations Distribution of gain field types emerging at the hidden layer of a supervised neural network similar to that used by Zipser and Andersen with varying number of hidden neurons Lighter tones indicate smaller layers and dark blue indicates larger layers Discussion In this study we investigated the role of architectural and learning constraints in neural network models that learned to encode spatial information resulting from the combination of visual and postural signals Results showed that compared to the supervised architecture originally proposed by Zipser and Andersen unsupervised architectures like Restricted Boltzmann Machines and autoencoders discover space codes that more closely reproduce the distribution of neuronal tuning functions observed in neurophysiological experiments In particular the majority of hidden neurons of RBMs and autoencoders exhibited gain modulation which in some cases only depended either on eye or effector position while in other cases depended on both eye and effector positions thereby resulting in multiple gain fields In fact all unsupervised models developed a much higher percentage of gain modulated neurons compared to the supervised models Although the precise distribution of gain field types in the cerebral cortex depends on the exact recording site and Goldberg our simulations suggest that this efficient form of encoding emerges more naturally if the task requires to reconstruct the whole sensory input rather than to simply discover a mapping to a target motor program In other words gain field coding might be useful when the goal is to discover internal representations of the input data that is when the aim is to unveil and more explicitly encode the latent factors underlying the input data distribution As a general principle the quality of an internal representation should reflect how well the learned features disentangle as many factors of variation as possible at the same time discarding as little information about the data as is practical et al In the specific case of sensorimotor transformations it has been proposed that good internal representations should have a variety of properties such as the ability to combine the input signal in a nonlinear way the ability to fully cover the range of possible input values and the ability to represent multiple reference frames simultaneously within the same neurons and Snyder Populations of gain modulated neurons satisfy these requirements allowing to encode visual space using a flexible set of basis functions Notably our simulations showed that this allows to learn coordinate transformations in two separate stages by first learning the set of basis functions in a completely unsupervised way and then learning appropriate mappings to target motor commands by relying on explicit supervision or reinforcement signals and Snyder Our analyses also highlighted several differences in the spatial codes learned by RBMs and autoencoders despite the fact that these two unsupervised architectures are often considered similar if not equivalent et al Coates et al Even from a simple qualitative analysis of the visual receptive fields it turned out that these models developed different internal representations Subsequent analyses conducted to investigate the emergence of gain fields further revealed that the distribution of hidden neurons tuning functions in RBMs and autoencoders was similar only for a very narrow choice of the An important finding was that RBMs spontaneously exhibited a remarkable level of sparseness which made them insensitive to external sparsity constraints and which encouraged the emergence of compressed forms of spatial coding based on gain modulation The spontaneous level of sparseness in RBMs could be manipulated only within a narrow range by imposing an extreme sparsity constraint and jointly reducing the size of the hidden layer This forced the internal representations to rely on even fewer neurons and produced an increase in the percentage of multiple gain fields These findings are consistent with the intuition that reducing the computational resources forces the networks to discover more complex forms of encoding such as those resulting from the combination of many sensory postural variables into multiple gain fields Notably for RBMs this was the case even when the task did not involve any coordinate transformations which implied that postural variables were orthogonal In other words despite the fact that eye and effector positions were varied independently across training patterns the RBMs with fewer active neurons often combined these signals together resulting in an increase of multiple gain fields Nevertheless unlike autoencoders RBMs always dedicated some representational resources also to encode eye and effector positions independently Autoencoders turned out to rely on much more distributed representations compared to RBMs and were therefore extremely sensitive to external sparsity constraints This implies that compared to RBMs autoencoders have an additional that must be carefully tuned Notably when the sparsity pressure was reduced hidden neurons in the autoencoders did not develop any form of gain modulation Only for specific values of sparsity constraints autoencoders could reproduce the variety of gain field types observed in neurophysiological data et al Graziano et al Snyder et al Chang et al with a distribution compatible with that of RBMs However in autoencoders the underlying sparseness indexes did not seem to be systematically related to the complexity of the emergent spatial codes Though these findings alone do not allow to adjudicate between models they call for a more systematic investigation of these different learning architectures possibly spanning other domains and using a more direct comparison to neurophysiological data A plausible explanation for the striking differences in the spontaneous level of sparseness between RBMs and autoencoders can be found when considering the different processing dynamics embedded in these two neural network models Indeed in autoencoders the activation of each hidden neuron is deterministic and simply corresponds to the value returned by the logistic activation function In RBMs instead the value returned by the logistic function is treated as a probability and the final activation of each hidden neuron is obtained by performing a stochastic binarization step This important difference likely produces more sharp neuronal activations driving RBMs to develop more sparse representations compared to autoencoders From a broader perspective we believe that stochastic neural networks such as RBMs and their extension into hierarchical generative models will have an increasingly central role in neurocomputational modeling because they provide a unique bridge between descriptions of cognition in terms of Bayesian computation and mechanistic explanations inspired by the biophysical properties of real neuronal networks and Zorzi For example generative neural networks are compatible with Bayesian approaches based on probabilistic population codes et al which have been successfully used to simulate sensorimotor transformations with basis functions and Sejnowski Pouget and Snyder RBMs extend the basis function approach by explaining how learning might shape the emergent neuronal gain fields and they could similarly be combined with attractor dynamics to simulate optimal statistical inference over multisensory spatial representations Pouget et al and spatial remapping in attention orienting Casarotti et al Moreover the fact that generative networks can simulate both evoked and intrinsic neuronal activity makes them particularly suited to investigate spontaneous brain activity which has been recognized as a fundamental property of the brain but whose computational role is still largely unknown An intriguing hypothesis suggests that intrinsic activity could help with driving the brain close to states that are probable to be valid inferences once an external input arrives thus potentially shortening the reaction time of the system et al Stochastic generative networks are consistent with this framework and also support the idea that neuronal noise could play an important role during sampling et al for example by keeping the system in a metastable state that facilitates flexible settling into the most appropriate configuration Deco et al Notably we are also beginning to better understand how these powerful models could be implemented with biologically more realistic architectures such as those incorporating temporal dynamics and communication et al Nessler et al In conclusion we hope that the recent breakthroughs in machine learning will attract the interest of the neuroscience community as these models hold great promise for improving our understanding of how learning shapes and organizes information processing in complex neuronal networks Author

deformity and gradual lengthening through this osteotomy site has greatly simplified postoperative recovery This manuscript is a review of the techniques that are currently being used in surgery Methods The article is broken into two sections distal femur osteotomy and tibia osteotomy Each is addressed separately since they have different personalities Also included are topics of particular interest that surface in ongoing conferences regarding the ILN This work is a mix of expert opinion and best practice supported by peer reviewed publications on the topic Results Most published series demonstrate excellent results with the ILN Certain precautions are reiterated including avoiding mechanical failure need for a percutaneous osteotomy need for and the need for blocking screws Discussion Current controversies will be brought to light and discussed The reader should find this aspect particularly helpful in navigating this rapidly evolving field Internal lengthening nail Limb deformity Limb lengthening Distraction Malalignment Introduction The introduction of the internal lengthening nail has revolutionized how deformity surgeons approach the treatment of complex malalignment and shortening about the knee Where once external fixation was required to manage simultaneous deformity with lengthening internal fixation has utilized the tactic of acutely correcting the malalignment and gradually lengthening through this osteotomy site Some studies have even shown that the regenerate heals faster lower consolidation with ILN when compared with external fixation Certain technical considerations are important to the success of this newer approach including blocking screws and the intraoperative use of external fixation to control the bony reduction during reaming This review article aims to present successful strategies for deformity correction and lengthening through the distal femur and proximal tibia Methods femur Retrograde femoral nailing surgical technique The retrograde approach to the femur offers excellent control over distal femoral deformity The distal femur is an ideal location for osteotomy due to its reliable bone formation during distraction osteogenesis The challenge of the distal femur lies in its width which allows for the reamer and intramedullary nail to move in many possible directions In order to secure a path for the nail to pass blocking screws have been implemented blocking screws ensure that the reamer and IM nail will head in the proper direction both correcting the acute deformity and preventing deformity This concept of deformity is well known to deformity surgeons with experience using external fixators but may not be so obvious to other orthopedic surgeons attempting deformity correction and lengthening with the IM nail For retrograde nailing with a distal femoral osteotomy the distal bone fragment can be expected to flex during lengthening This requires that a blocking screw be placed posterior to the nail at the time of the index surgery in anticipation of the impending deformity The mechanical axis will deviate laterally during lengthening at an expected quantity of mm of translation per cm of lengthening This circumstance is of particular relevance for lengthenings of cm where mm of lateral translation can occur This scenario is less common in the setting of periarticular deformity correction where average lengthening is cm and more common in the practice of stature lengthening which is not the focus of this paper With regard to stature lengthening where an antegrade approach is typically used an interesting phenomenon occurs the nail and femur tend to bend into a few degrees of varus This varus deflection counteracts the lateralization of the mechanical axis Therefore in more aggressive lengthenings the use of an antegrade technique will typically keep the mechanical axis neutral For a retrograde lengthening the mechanical axis would need to be shifted the appropriate number of millimeters medially during planning to anticipate the valgus deviation This will add a small amount of varus correction acutely to the correction The reverse planning technique can be used as well Location of the deformity The location of the deformity in the distal femur is important to determine This technique is best suited for deformities A far distal deformity requiring a very osteotomy may be better treated with a plate An ILN can be inserted proximally to address rotation and shortening Figures Figure This preop lateral radiograph shows a flexion deformity of the distal femur Postop lateral shows a correction of the apex anterior deformity through an posterior opening wedge osteotomy stabilized with a plate and a proximal femoral lengthening with an ILN This far distal osteotomy would be difficult to control with an intramedullary implant Surgical steps Preoperative planning There are many ways to plan for the deformity correction and lengthening Whatever technique is used will require two considerations first the existing deformity needs to be measured Second the expected lateral deviation of the mechanical axis that occurs during lengthening needs to be considered Then an osteotomy site is picked translation is accounted for blocking screw position is planned and nail length and width are selected Figures Figure This inch AP radiograph allows for deformity planning with correction of varus and shortening The mechanical axis planning is used to determine the magnitude and location of the deformity The red lines show the planned path of the ILN that will ensure correction of mechanical axis The lines also show the length of the nail The white lines are placed to designate the path of the nail and the circles are used to mark the location of the blocking screws These radiographic plans are brought into the OR for comparison with intraop fluoroscopy shots Osteotomy site The osteotomy site that was selected on the preoperative plan is located on the femur under fluoroscopy A mm incision is made in the lateral thigh at this level and taken through the iliotibial band The incision can be extended for an IT band release We release the IT band routinely for correction of valgus and lengthening and for large lengthenings A drill is then inserted with a protective sleeve and multiple drill holes are created in one plane This creates vent holes during reaming and marks the osteotomy site to help with blocking screw placement Blocking screws When correcting coronal plane deformity blocking screws are inserted The position of the screw needs to be decided as a part of the preoperative planning and replicated in the OR For valgus deformity a blocking screw is placed lateral to the proposed path of the ILN Figure For varus deformity the blocking screw is placed medial to the path of the nail Figure An additional screw can be placed in the proximal fragment as well for optimal control A blocking screw needs to be placed posterior to the path of the ILN Figures and Figure This illustration shows the suggested position of the blocking screws for correction of a valgus deformity The screws centered around the osteotomy are more typically used leaving the peripheral screws as an option The same planning can be used for correction of a varus deformity The overlay of the hands is showing a principle called the rule of whereby the bone is grabbed with the thumb and index fingers of both hands and a correction simulated The blocking screws should be placed opposite the location of the thumb and index fingers In the sagittal plane the blocking screws are inserted posterior to the ILN at the osteotomy site The distal screw is the most important but the proximal screw can also be used for a shorter nail The peripheral screws are seldom needed This fluoroscopy shot shows ideal posterior blocking screw placement close to the osteotomy site and lying against the ILN Half pins A half pin is inserted into the distal femur using cannulated technique A is inserted posterior to the path of the IM nail and checked using The wire is then with a cannulated drill bit through a small incision The solid half pin is then inserted Figure A second half pin is inserted in the proximal femur proximal to the tip of the ILN Rotation should be accounted for in this step for later correction Figure A mm half pin is seen in the typical location posterior to the path of the ILN Distal fragment The knee is flexed and the distal femur is prepared through an arthrotomy either through or medial to the patellar tendon A mm is drilled in the center of the notch under AP and lateral fluoroscopy until it reaches the osteotomy site The ACL mm reamer is then inserted over the guide wire up to the osteotomy site taking care not to damage the patellar cartilage Osteotomy The osteotomy is then performed with an osteotome through the previous drill hole incision under fluoroscopy The reduction is performed with translation and rotational correction The external fixator can then be placed to hold this reduction Figure Figure A simple frame is used to hold the reduction of the osteotomy Reaming Sequential reaming is then performed mm over the nail diameter There are different teachings on the correct way to prepare the canal This will be further discussed ILN insertion The external fixator is removed The nail should slide into the canal without too much resistance A mallet can be used but if aggressive tapping is needed then we suggest removing the nail and reaming an additional mm The distal locking is then performed with the targeting device Figure The rotation and alignment are checked and adjusted with the half pins The proximal screws are inserted with a free hand technique Figure The AP fluoroscopy shot shows the distal femur after successful distal interlocking with the varus deformity corrected The blocking screws are positioned to prevent varus deviation during lengthening The external half pin is also seen in the field Lengthening begins after a latency period and proceeds at approximately mm per day The patient is followed at regular intervals with radiographs checking for regenerate quality and joint contractures Figures and Figure The lengthening is complete and the limb length is checked The regenerate bone is filling in but is still plastic enough to allow for of the length The can be affected by hip and knee joint muscle contractures yielding a false length measurement This needs to be considered before the limb The final alignment and length are checked after ILN removal Results femur Effect of acute deformity correction on the growth of the regenerate An acute correction of the femur coronal plane deformity maximum will not impact the ability of regenerate bone to form through a distal femoral osteotomy At the Limb Lengthening and Reconstruction Society an abstract was presented reviewing a series of patients all treated with simultaneous distal femoral deformity correction and lengthening with an ILN In this cohort there were no nonunions after an acute correction of an average of of deformity and gradual lengthening of an average of cm of lengthening Rate of lengthening As a general rule G A Ilizarov taught the world that bony distraction achieved optimal osteogenesis when performed at a rate of mm per day split into at least four separate adjustments of mm per day With the precision interlocking nails available rate can be strictly controlled In our practice distraction needs to be started four days after surgery at the accelerated rate of mm per day mm four times for four days and then slowed to a rate of mm per day mm three times Rate is then further based on regenerate formation observed during the postop period We have not experienced any premature consolidation or nonunion in the femur using this formula premature consolidation occurred due to a Singh et al reported excellent results starting lengthening post operative day at mm day Other authors have used a more classic rate of mm per day following seven days of latency however in their series the external magnet was unresponsive and they had difficulty achieving the final goal and had premature consolidation These problems may have been related to excess at the distraction site created by too slow a lengthening rate Minimally invasive osteotomy The role of minimally invasive osteotomy is believed to be paramount to the success of acute deformity correction followed by distraction The creation of drill holes at the osteotomy site followed by reaming leads to the deposition of endosteal autograft at the osteotomy site This is noticeable on the intraop radiographs Figure Osteotomy is then achieved without ever visualizing the bone The osteotome is directed by feel and by fluoroscopy It is possible that the success of acute correction is in part due to the minimally invasive nature of this osteotomy An open osteotomy may drain the site of the autograft and ruin the regeneration potential Therefore the excellent results achieved with this combination of techniques cannot be assigned to any one variable and deserve further study to determine the impact of each variable on the end product One series reported nonunions which may be due to a distraction rhythm of mm BID or due to use of the or due to a more open osteotomy technique Figure This intraop fluoroscopy frame shows a blush at the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site Pain control The United States is exiting an era of heavy narcotic prescribing by launching an initiative to drastically cut down on opioids The field of limb deformity surgery in the US has relied greatly on prolonged narcotic use for the duration of the lengthening process and often the entire time that external fixator is on the patient Based on promising results in pediatric patients adult surgeons are moving toward the aggressive use of acetaminophen and with minimal narcotic backup There is concern that the use of NSAIDs may slow the healing requiring a different rate of distraction Alternatively the use of narcotics may have negatively affected the regenerate formation and abandoning them could positively affect the bone formation going forward The results of this paradigm shift will be seen in the coming months Intraoperative external fixation The use of external fixation during this surgery is helpful for maintaining the deformity correction during the reaming process Since the ILN will follow the path of the reamer we believe it is best to create that path with the bony deformity reduced and stabilized The half pins also offer rigid control of the bone fragments This helps to rotate the osteotomy to ensure it is complete translate the bone fragments to achieve the desired reduction and control the final rotation prior to interlocking Some surgeons feel that the half pins and the external fixator are not necessary however they ensure a smooth procedure with reliable results One study showed that larger half pin size was associated with a more accurate correction of the mechanical axis Rigid vs flexible reaming The decision of whether to ream the femoral canal using rigid reamers or flexible reamers has been debated extensively The advantage of rigid reaming is that the sagittal curve of the femur is minimized allowing for less of the canal This in turn gives the ILN a tighter fit with less potential for malalignment at the time of insertion or during the lengthening process If performed correctly the rigid reamer can preferentially remove posterior cortical bone which some surgeons feel is important There are several advantages to flexible reaming It is more convenient since it does not require special reamers Rigid reamers have the potential to notch the anterior cortex putting the femur at greater risk for fracture a problem unlikely to happen with flexible reamers with flexible reamers has not been a problem with excellent alignment and healing obtained Distal curved vs straight ILN The ILN comes with both curved and straight distal options There has been little discussion as to the advantages of each There may be an increased tendency to create a procurvatum deformity when using the curved nail In cases where the surgeon wants to correct a procurvatum deformity at the osteotomy site a curved nail can be rotated to extend the osteotomy site We have found that the straight entry ILN will often contact the posterior cortex obviating the need for a blocking screw Figures and Figure The intraop fluoroscopy image shows contact of the posterior cortex of the distal fragment with the ILN at the osteotomy site After cm of lengthening the distal fragment has not been able to flex due to the cortical abutment Methods tibia Tibial nailing surgical technique Acute deformity correction of the tibia followed by distraction with an ILN is gaining popularity Tibial nailing is more challenging than retrograde femoral nailing with regard to alignment control The entry point of the tibial nail is difficult to pinpoint due to the need to flex the knee with subsequent poor AP fluoroscopic imaging The suprapatellar approach to tibial preparation may help with alignment precision although this has never been studied in deformity patients Proximal tibia osteotomy much like proximal tibial fractures often requires the use of blocking screws and external fixation The posterior blocking screw is critical in preventing flexion of the osteotomy Coronal plane blocking screws also ensure that the nail stays central on the AP view Surgical steps Preoperative planning The tibia does not deviate from the mechanical axis during lengthening making planning straightforward An osteotomy site is picked translation is accounted for blocking screw position is planned and nail length and width are selected Figures and Nail width is often quite limited in the isthmus requiring either a thinner nail or a shorter nail Figure The inch standing film shows a diaphyseal valgus deformity and limb length discrepancy The path of the ILN is planned with the osteotomy site at the intersection of the red lines Osteotomy site The osteotomy site that was selected on the preoperative plan is located on the tibia under fluoroscopy A mm incision is made in proximal leg A drill is then inserted with a protective sleeve and multiple drill holes are created in one plane This creates vent holes during reaming and marks the osteotomy site to help with blocking screw placement Blocking screws When correcting coronal plane deformity blocking screws are inserted The position of the screw needs to be decided as a part of the preoperative planning The distance of the screws from the osteotomy site and cortex should be replicated in the OR For valgus deformity a blocking screw is placed lateral to the proposed path of the ILN Figure For varus deformity the blocking screw is placed medial to the path of the nail An additional screw can be placed in the distal fragment as well for optimal control The most critical blocking screw is placed posterior to the path of the IM nail in the proximal fragment This will ensure the nail is not inserted in flexion and will prevent flexion from developing during lengthening Figures and Figure This shows a different The valgus correction is maintained by placing blocking screws in the concavity of the deformity Peripheral blocking screws can be used as well The sagittal plane requires at least one blocking screw in the proximal fragment near the osteotomy screw shown at the entry site of the ILN is theoretical and is never This lateral film shows a posterior blocking screw Half pins A half pin is inserted into the proximal tibia using cannulated technique A is inserted posterior to the path of the IM nail usually superior and anterior to the fibular head and checked using The wire is then with a cannulated drill bit through a small incision The solid half pin is then inserted A second half pin is inserted in the distal tibia distal to the tip of the ILN Rotation should be accounted for in this step for later correction Figure Figure In this unrelated case the external fixator helps to maintain the reduction of the deformity correction after osteotomy during reaming A suprapatellar approach was used in this case Distal syndesmotic screw The distal syndesmotic screw is placed to protect the ankle during distraction We recommend a mm fully threaded solid cortical screw Fibular osteotomy The fibula is cut percutaneously by with a and then using an osteotome Figure Figure The osteotome is inserted through a limited incision under fluoroscopy Proximal fragment The knee is flexed and the proximal tibia is prepared through an arthrotomy either through or near the patellar tendon A suprapatellar approach can also be used A mm is drilled under AP and Lateral fluoroscopy until it reaches the osteotomy site The ACL mm reamer is then inserted over the guide wire up to the osteotomy site Osteoplasty The osteotomy is then performed with an osteotome through the previous drill hole incision under fluoroscopy The reduction is performed with translation and rotational correction The external fixator can then be secured to hold this reduction Reaming Sequential reaming is then performed the canal by mm ILN insertion The external fixator is loosened The nail should slide into the canal without too much resistance A mallet can be used but if aggressive tapping is needed then we suggest removing the nail and reaming an additional mm The proximal locking is then performed with the targeting device The rotation and alignment are checked and adjusted with the half pins The distal interlock screws are inserted with a free hand technique Proximal syndesmotic screw The proximal screw is placed using a cannulated technique A guide wire is placed through the fibular head from lateral to medial It is and then a solid screw is inserted to prevent migration of the fibula during lengthening Figure Figure In this unrelated case the proximal syndesmotic screw also served as the posterior blocking screw Fasciotomy It is routine to perform a percutaneous fasciotomy of the anterior compartment when acutely correcting a tibial deformity to prevent compartment syndrome Lengthening begins after a latency period and proceeds at approximately mm per day The patient is followed at regular intervals with radiographs checking for regenerate quality and joint contractures Figures and Figure The shown in Figures and are a continuation of the patient presented in Figures and The end of distraction radiograph shows equal limb length and ideal alignment A lateral radiograph shows interval healing of the regenerate and ideal sagittal alignment Results tibia Prophylactic peroneal nerve decompression It is clear that tibial lengthening places tension on the common peroneal nerve and can cause nerve damage Special consideration is given to the correction of valgus or rotational deformities in conjunction with lengthening These realignment procedures will further stretch the peroneal nerve and therefore require a peroneal nerve release This is done at the beginning of the surgery under tourniquet For varus deformity correction with lengthening the peroneal nerve release is not standard For larger lengthening goals lengthening or greater than increase in tibial the release should be strongly considered In all cases of tibia lengthening the common peroneal nerve is at risk for injury and nerve function needs to be closely monitored postoperatively during the lengthening process Will acute deformity correction affect the growth of the regenerate This topic is not as well studied as in the femoral counterpart Acute deformity correction of in the tibia may affect the quality of the regenerate as measured by the consolidation index and circumferential healing greater than the effect seen in the femur The consolidation index for femoral lengthening has been excellent averaging days cm than that seen with external fixation These studies include very few tibia cases obscuring our ability to compare CI among tibia lengthening cases The protocol we use for the tibial lengthening is slower than for femoral lengthening The latency is seven days after which the tibia is lengthened at a rate of mm per day split into four mm lengthening sessions This is done for four days and then slowed to mm three times per day This slower lengthening schedule has been helpful in protecting the osteotomy ability to heal Tibial bone healing The tibial consolidation rate is significantly slower than that of the femur using ILN The situation is further complicated by the asymmetric healing of the different tibial cortices The deficiency is typically in the anterior portion of the regenerate Responding to the deficient regenerate is complicated since a slower rate of distraction will help the anterior cortex while placing the posterior cortex at risk for premature consolidation Most surgeons will avoid consolidation in favor of the posterior cortical healing Surgical treatment is varied depending on the severity of the anterior defect but can include observation percutaneous drilling and injection of bone marrow aspirate concentrate exchange nailing open bone grafting or a combination Discussion The ILN is a great advancement in the area of limb deformity and lengthening particularly in the femur Surgeons are still learning the capabilities and shortcomings of these devices The quality of the available implants continues to improve The tibia continues to challenge abilities to control

with these terms Brain dynamics are often taken to be temporal dynamics of spiking and membrane potentials in a balanced network Almost all evidence for a balanced network comes from recordings of cell bodies of few single neurons neglecting more than of the cortical network We examined the dynamics of excitation and inhibition simultaneously in dendrites and axons over four visual areas of ferrets exposed to visual scenes with stationary and moving objects The visual stimuli broke the tight balance between excitation and inhibition such that the network exhibited longer episodes of net excitation subsequently balanced by net inhibition in contrast to a balanced network Locally in all four areas the amount of net inhibition matched the amount of net excitation with a delay of ms The dynamics of evolved to reduce the complexity of neuron interactions over the whole network to a flow on a manifold within ms In contrast to the pure temporal dynamics the low dimensional flow evolved to distinguish the simple visual scenes cerebral cortex mechanics of vision dynamical systems balanced network inhibition voltage sensitive dye Introduction How do neurons in the brain collaborate to produce visual perception This question has no satisfactory answer yet The idea of neuron coding in vision builds on the notion that the temporal sequence of spikes from single neurons or a population of neurons is sufficient to distinguish different visual objects or scenes Gross et al Richmond and Optican The spike trains are analyzed statistically or analyzed for their information content to find a match or correlation with the present scene or object An alternative to these objectives is to use a dynamical systems approach and examine the evolution of the spiking in state space Forsberg et al used both approaches i e examined the temporal dynamics of spiking populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex in state space and examined the spike rates in single trials from the same population Although both the temporal spike rate changes and the temporal spiking dynamics in state space reported whether a sharp or a smooth visual transient changed the visual scene neither could differentiate simple visual scenes on a single trial basis When one examines temporal structures of spike trains or membrane currents for information about a current visual scene and when one analyzes the temporal aspects of these variables in state space one neglects what goes on in the remaining network and one neglects the possibility that combinations of temporal and spatial evolution of spiking or membrane potential changes might be more efficient in distinguishing visual scenes Therefore we examined the dynamics of the membrane potential changes of the visual areas and of the ferrets used by Forsberg et al By dynamics we mean the progression of membrane current changes in the topological space made up of the cortical network of neurons The cortical network of neurons is formed by the synaptic connected neurons having their cell bodies in the cerebral cortex The evolutions of the membrane potentials over the four visual areas are described as trajectories and vectors in state space We found that within ms after exposure to the visual scenes the dynamics reduced to a state space where the trajectories of the membrane potential changes caused by the individual scenes clearly separated These diverging flows on a low dimensional manifold show that the connectivity and spiking dynamics in the visual cortical network swiftly constrain the patterns of membrane potential changes to simple low dimensional solutions unique for each of the scenes Although this succinctly describes the interactions of the membrane potential changes in mathematical terms it does not provide a biophysical explanation of the mechanisms The visual scenes were very simple composed of one stationary or moving bar Creutzfeldt et al showed that a moving bar first depolarized and then hyperpolarized the neurons in the primary visual cortex of the cat Currently there seems to be a consensus that neurons in the primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates have a balance between excitation and inhibition during visual stimulation and Pare Anderson et al Monier et al Priebe and Ferster Haider et al Rudolph et al Tan et al Xue et al Dehghani et al The terms excitation and inhibition are used in several ways In this context balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortical network means that the excitatory membrane currents inhibitory membrane currents Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky Alternatively the balance has been interpreted as balanced ratio between excitatory and inhibitory membrane conductances and Machens for a recent It does not matter too much which of these definitions of balance one adheres to the point is that the balance is not instantaneous If it were there would be no excitatory spiking of the neurons The membrane potential however cannot show the balance between excitatory and inhibitory membrane currents because the membrane potential can be high during large inhibitory currents and conductances and currents can change markedly without affecting the membrane potential too much et al Monier et al Priebe and Ferster Haider et al Rudolph et al Okun and Lampl Tan et al Xue et al The finding of Creutzfeldt et al is still valid although it does not say anything about the instantaneous balance between excitation and inhibition The time derivative of the membrane potential reports this balance because it equals the sum of the ionic currents through the membrane divided by the specific capacitance specific capacitance is regarded If the inhibition first increases after a delay there would be a chance that excitation can spread through the cortical network The question is how big this delay is In vivo patch clamp recordings of individual neurons in primary visual cortex have generally shown two types of responses The excitatory conductance increased while the inhibitory conductance decreased or did not change initially but thereafter increased with a delay of some ms For other stimuli and for other neurons the excitatory and inhibitory conductances increased almost or the inhibitory conductances lagged the excitatory conductances with a small ms delay et al Monier et al Priebe and Ferster Haider et al Rudolph et al Okun and Lampl Tan et al Xue et al In these studies the excitatory currents and inhibitory currents were measured in the cell bodies of only a limited number of neurons As cell body membranes only make up an estimated of the total membrane surface of cortical neurons and Harris such measurements say little about the balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents in the dendrites and axon terminals of the measured neurons and Mitchell In this report we take a network approach and examine the dynamics of the membrane potential changes with a voltage sensitive dye et al simultaneously in areas The cortical surface exposed for measurement was mm neurons mm and that of these contribute fluorescence to the VSD signal the estimate of the number of neurons measured would be around Voltage sensitive dyes reliably report changes in membrane potential of neurons et al The voltage sensitive dye signal reports relative increases and decreases of population membrane potential compared to baseline at the network scale and without any bias toward spiking probabilities receptive fields and stimulus feature preferences et al Under the assumption that the membranes in a small volume of the cortical network from where the fluorescence originates can be regarded as one compartment the dt of that compartment is the sum of the membrane currents multiplied by a constant et al The dt thus reports the instantaneous balance between excitatory currents and inhibitory currents in the network If the balance changes toward net inhibition matter whether this is due to reduced excitatory currents or increased inhibitory the dt significantly decreases below baseline fluctuations Thus we label significant decreases of the dt as net inhibition NINH and significant increases as net excitations NEX The dt has been used to measure balance in the cortex et al Harvey et al Onat et al Harvey and Roland Onat et al showed that the balance between excitation and inhibition in response to a drifting grating at ms goes into NINH and then switches to NEX This and the other dt studies showed the temporal characteristics of the inhibition balance at one location or averaged from all locations However to our knowledge the evolution of inhibition and the balance between excitation and inhibition has not been explored NEX and NINH evolved with similar dynamics in all four visual areas and distinguished the visual scenes The visual stimuli disrupted the tight balance between excitation and inhibition and drove the network into a regime tolerating large amplitude NEX and NINHs However at each cortical spot in the four visual areas the amount of integrated NEX and NINH were strongly correlated showing that after longer delays became balanced with overall in the exposed part of the cortical network Materials and methods Animals The voltage sensitive signals were measured in female adult ferrets These animals also participated in the study of Harvey and Roland but none of the results presented in this study have been presented in Harvey and Roland or elsewhere Laminar action potentials were measured at the border between areas in adult female ferrets of which also had their VSD i measured The Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm had approved all procedures The ferrets were anesthetized and artificially ventilated with isofluran mixed with N O O and paralyzed with pancuronium bromide throughout the experiments A craniotomy with a chamber affixed to the skull exposed cortical areas and The partial pressure of CO was maintained between and KPa Stimuli In all animals known cortical landmarks were used to guide a single electrode penetration at the estimated crossing of the vertical and horizontal meridian in areas The receptive field at this area was then mapped using an method et al The monitor position was then adjusted to be precisely centered to this RF location Stimuli were presented in a pseudorandom order on a video monitor with a refresh rate of Hz located cm in front of the animal Research Systems Kent Stimuli consisted of horizontal bars cd m on a homogenous gray background cd m There were six conditions A bar moving downwards from the center of field of view with a velocity of s for ms along the vertical meridian A bar moving upward from the CFOV with a velocity of s for ms along the vertical meridian Upward and downward moving bars initially flashed below and above the center of field of view respectively and moving a total of with a velocity of s along the vertical meridian for a period of ms with start and end points equidistant from the screens center A single stationary bar was presented at the CFOV for ms In addition a condition was included consisting of a homogenous gray screen cd m presented continuously in between the stimulus conditions Each of these six conditions was repeated times Voltage sensitive dye measurements The procedures were described in detail recently and Roland The cortex was stained for h with the voltage sensitive dye mg ml n or mg ml n Imaging Rehovot Imaging was centered on the initial recording site and acquired using a photodiode array WuTech Instruments Gaithersburg Images of the voltage sensitive dye signal were acquired at a rate of kHz stimulus presentation was synchronized to the electrocardiogram and respiration stopped during stimulus presentation The voltage sensitive dye signal in most animals n covered both the representations of the CFOV at the border and the CFOV representation at border Laminar electrophysiology A ferrets having the measured The multiunit activity was recorded with single shank channel laminar probes Ann Arbor with recording site resistances of and leads separated by The signal was digitally band pass filtered Hz and KHz At each recording site receptive fields were first mapped using the methodology noted above For electrode penetrations in cortex mapping the CFOV the receptive fields in the granular layer were less than Current source density We estimated current source densities from the second spatial derivative of the local field potentials in filtered original data files et al The data files were averaged over trials for each lead either from a single stationary bar or from whole screen flashes of Hz Layer was estimated to start where the early sink appeared sink being at the upper part of layer the supragranular and infragranular layers above respective below layer et al Data analysis voltage sensitive dye The voltage sensitive dye signals were analyzed up to ms after the start of the stimulus The details of the analysis have been described elsewhere et al Eriksson et al Harvey and Roland The signal in the blank condition was subtracted from the signal of the stimulus conditions and divided by the background fluorescence to yield the fractional fluorescence F referred to here as VSD i Usually the VSD i of trials were averaged to give one Cytoarchitectonics Six of the eight ferrets had their cytoarchitectural borders determined between areas and and and and Their brains were sectioned stained and the cytoarchitectural borders determined The sections were reconstructed to a volume and the borders overlaid the hexagonal map of the Figure as described in detail in Harvey and Roland The individual with the cytoarchitectural borders were aligned as described in detail in Harvey et al to produce the average cytoarchitectural borders in Figures and Movies Figure Original averaged data from the cortex at the red retinotopic zone for the CFOV Relation between dt value in upper layers and supragranular MUA spiking rate value from cortex mapping the penetration The contour plots are identical snapshots of the mean of animals at absolute maximum ms stationary bar to show the red sampling area mapping the CFOV from where the temporal course of the mean VSD and mean dt were sampled The red arrow marks the location

square displayed for ms had an OFF response moving bars did not Mean standard error of mean shown n for respective stimulus Bars starting in the evoked sharp net excitatory transients followed by net inhibitions shown in the dt whereas the bars moving toward the CFOV evoked early and late net excitations which after the bar had been mapped at cortex representing the CFOV was followed by net inhibition State space analysis of trajectory differences in the time domain In each animal the photodiode channels sampling from the cortex mapping the CFOV were chosen The mean of dt from these channels in one animal is a time vector for one stimulus condition A principal component analysis PCA was then performed on the data matrix for the stimulus conditions to be compared in state space for all animals The first components accounted for of the total variance For each condition and animal the first three principal components were used as regressors against the time vector of the condition to obtain a for each principal component showing how well it describes the condition The polynomial of principal components times the was then calculated to show how a particular condition is described by all three principal components The difference between two conditions polynomials within an animal was further calculated to describe how the two conditions differ in the same state space as a function of time Features in the time series of the conditions that are not part of the common state space are thus effectively removed and thereby not compared between conditions Across animals a statistical t was used to test if the difference between in any given time point could be rejected in the given state space False Discovery Rate was finally used to correct for multiple comparisons over time at Net excitation and net inhibition Experimentally the change in the is proportional to the change in the average membrane potential of a small population of neurons et al Ferezou et al Thus dVSD t dt k dV m t dt The change in the membrane potential is the sum of the ionic currents divided by the specific capacitance dV m t dt C m g Na V m t E Na g Ca V m t E Ca g Cl V m t E Cl g K V m t E k In which C m is the specific capacitance of these membranes E is the reversal potential and g the conductance Then under the assumption that the membranes in a small volume of the cortex from where the fluorescence originates can be regarded as one compartment et al Roland the dt of that compartment is dVSD t dt k C m g Na V m t E Na g Ca V m t E Ca g Cl V m t E Cl g K V m t E k At the network scale at which our measurements of the dt were done the membrane compartment comprises the membranes of thousands of neurons at a single spot Although a few of these neurons may be depolarized over their spiking threshold these action potentials will not be detectable in the et al Arieli et al Senseman Roland Slovin et al Petersen et al Jancke et al Ferezou et al Roland et al Ahmed et al Eriksson et al Harvey et al Ayzenshtat et al Chavane et al Harvey and Roland et al The reason most likely is that the fraction of membrane depolarized over spiking threshold is too minute Consequently the will reflect a population membrane potential above the reversal potentials for Cl and K currents and below the reversal potentials for Na and Ca The dt thus indicates the sum membrane currents of the membranes in the compartment Definition of net excitation and net inhibition For a single spot in the network where the dt is measured a significant decrease from baseline fluctuations of dt is a net inhibition and a significant increase is a net excitation The baseline fluctuations were determined in the period Statistically significant decreases and increases from baseline fluctuations p For the analysis of and the was filtered with a temporal Gaussian filter ms and then the temporal derivative dt was calculated A filter of ms did not change the results No spatial filtering was done but in the figures and movies the original hexagon pixels were Statistical significance In each animal statistical comparisons between the time interval and the interval for all photodiode channels are corrected for mass significance with a false discovery rate of and Hochberg The results are movies and snapshot sequences of only statistically significant dt increases and decreases p As our definition of NEX and NINH is significant increases and decreases from baseline fluctuations in the dt in the period it implies that these fluctuations will be smaller than the and and that there might be periods in the interval in which and are not defined significant parts of the cortex will have the same color as the interval in figures and movies Movies and Figures show the evolution of the and at State space analysis of dt trajectories To produce Figure The dt underwent PCA For each of the cortical zones in the figure the data matrix comprised conditions The PCA was done using Singular Value Decomposition as implemented in the PCA routine X U V T X N L where N N times N animals N conditions is the number of observations and L is the number of photodiode channels example if the zone of cortex was monitored by When all of the exposed cortex was examined L to the photodiode channels monitoring all cortical Figure State space trajectories of the dt in different cortical zones are similar The visual scenes and their associated trajectories in state space from the red zone Each trajectory is a projection of the first principal components all over time shown in ms after the stimulus start by the black numbers FP is the origo of the state space The first row of trajectories comes from the red zone i e the cortex mapping the CFOV The red parts of the trajectories show the time intervals with the largest acceleration Trajectories from the red zone also mapping the CFOV Red parts of trajectories show the fastest acceleration for the bars initially mapped in cortex representing the last two red parts are shown for comparison with A Cortical zones in which the stimulus in the top row was not mapped according to retinotopy and active evoked spiking The dt trajectories for each of the zones in Red parts of trajectories only shown for comparison with In all zones the trajectories were significantly different at from the period in the time interval ms for conditions with stimulus starting in CFOV and for interval ms for the last conditions Notice the similarities in trajectories irrespective of whether the stimulus was mapped by retinotopic localized spiking or not The vectors U u u u u N hold the coordinates of the observations in the PCA vector space spanned by V T v v v v L T The diagonal matrix L holds the singular values which scales vectors in U to reflect the variance explained by each of the L principal components The trajectories in dimensions are the u i u i u i coordinates plotted over a time series of i s Movies Note that the u i u i u i x i x i x i Figure shows the trajectories of the first three components Balance of net excitation net inhibition and delay To examine the balance between NEX and NINH we calculated the and of the and for the time intervals in which and were defined in the period from to ms We calculated the integrals of over the time interval the was defined added the integrals and divided by the number of time frames in the interval the was defined Similar for This produced the hexagon maps of and in Figure Thereafter we determined the delay between the maximum NEX and minimum of NINH NINHmin in all pixels where and were defined for each condition in each animal and calculated a mean delay for that condition in each animal We also calculated the correlation between and pixel by pixel for each condition and animal Figure NEX and NINH velocities The NEX and NINH velocities of propagation were determined by the algorithm of Ahmed et al As the algorithm assumes that the parameter amplitude progresses as an increase Figure in Ahmed et al the dt file was used Shortly a region of interest was made covering the progress of the NEX or NINH in an animal The mean dt for the time interval chosen dVSD was calculated Then all values of dt dVSD were divided in amplitude levels and the cortical positions of these amplitude levels vs time were plotted and a linear regression was made giving the velocity in mm ms and its statistical significance determined this paper Figure For further details see Ahmed et al The algorithm thus does not require a progress with constant amplitude and velocity NEX and NINH phase lags between areas We used the algorithm of et al This algorithm makes a Hilbert transform of the data under the assumption that all parts of the cortex monitored can be seen as one wave of NEX or one wave of NINH The different positions on the cortex x and hence the different cortical areas will be in different phases if there are delays in the propagation of NEX or NINH between areas The real part at position x is dVSD x Re The phase z x iy is a complex number The algorithm calculates the imaginary part as I m z x t P d t R e z x t t t from this the phase x t t a n I m z x t R e z x t t a n I m Z x t d V S D x t giving the phase Phase delays between the earliest point x and the other x s are then calculated in ms Figure To visualize the phase in Movie of the the was normalized to the maximum value in the time interval VSDmax i e pixel values were VSDmax The evoked spiking in areas and and The positions of the electrode penetrations were transferred to a map of the cortex monitored by the The electrode penetrations preserved their relation to the cytoarchtectural border between areas and The cortical map was centered to the electrodes mapping the very center of the field of view Stimulation The electrode penetrations are marked with white circles in the movies The treatments of the spike data and the calculation of the proportion evoked trials ms by ms for each electrode penetration was done separately for supragranular granular and infragranular layers as described in Forsberg et al For each electrode penetration the proportion of evoked trials was calculated for the specific layer Evoked trials of spiking are trials in which the spiking trajectories are outside the separatrix separating the spontaneous states from the evoked spiking states in state space analysis of spiking see Forsberg et al First episodes of a single spiking trial were detected as evoked if the velocity vectors of the trajectory of the spiking in state space were located outside the separatrix separating the state space into spontaneous ongoing spiking and evoked spiking details see Forsberg et al The proportion of trials evoked is shown for each ms for each penetration The number of encircled positions is less than because one position may represent more than electrode penetration to and a few electrode positions were outside the map Results In the experiments the anesthetized ferrets were exposed to a gray screen in an otherwise dark room The scene suddenly within ms shifted and a continuously moving bar or occasionally a stationary bar appeared We measured the voltage sensitive dye signal VSD i simultaneously from all points of the exposed cortex comprising visual areas and The activity was also measured from all layers in areas and to the same albeit not simultaneously with the VSD i measurements The VSD i data presented in this report were averaged over trials belonging to one stimulus condition to give the averaged signal and the dt Figure shows the typical time relation between the average spike rate and the time derivative dt For the scenes with stimuli appearing in the center of field of view CFOV the dt shows a strong NEX transient at the arrival of the increased spiking from layer and thereafter NINH For the scenes in which the stimulus passed through the CFOV after ms the network at the retinotopic site for the CFOV showed two smaller NEXes prior to the passage followed by a smooth further NEX that at ms was replaced by a NINH The fluctuations of the dt in the period were significantly smaller than the deviations caused by the changes of the visual scene at We interpret these smaller fluctuations as reflecting a tight balance between inhibition and excitation Temporal dynamics of in different cortical zones When stimuli are presented in the center of field of view they first increase the spiking in a small zone at the border between areas and and then with a delay in a similar zone at the border between areas and et al Harvey et al First we examined the dynamics of the balance between excitation and inhibition dt inside and outside zones in the network where the bars were retinotopically mapped We used a dynamical systems approach et al Forsberg et al and examined the evolution of the dt for each zone in multidimensional state space In this state space the time evolution of the dt evolves as a trajectory Each coordinate of the trajectory corresponds to one state of the network in one zone Figure shows the temporal dynamics of the derivative of the dye signal dt for the two retinotopic sites mapping the CFOV in areas and areas Prior to stimulus onset the trajectories evolve in a narrow part of state space close to with FP in Figure When the stimulus drives the evolution of the trajectories they accelerate make a smooth loop and return slowly by another route to the space near This is the typical stimulus evoked behavior of a dynamical system et al The trajectories did not show any sign of equilibrium points outside the In addition to these zones the cortex was subdivided into other zones shown in the colored inserts These zones comprise the cortex that did not show stimulus related retinotopic localized spiking For example the stationary bar did not lead to continuous spiking outside the red zones The trajectories of the dt systematically showed stimulus evoked dynamics in all zones no matter whether the zone mapped the stimulus or not The evoked parts of the trajectories were significantly different from the trajectories in the period discovery rate of We then tested whether the trajectories from the zone mapping the CFOV in the population of animals n distinguished the scenes shown in Figure There were no significant differences in the evoked part of the trajectories between the scenes with objects moving from the center of field of view at paired The scene with the stationary object could be distinguished from scenes with the object moving from the CFOV in the interval ms e after the OFF Scenes with a bar moving up or down from the peripheral field of view could be distinguished from to ms at for both The temporal dynamics of dt thus could not differentiate the visual scenes in all cases sequences of NEX and NINH in areas and Next we examined the evolution of the statistically significant changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortical network i e the NEX and NINH changes in anatomical space in each of the animals at The NEX and NINH were defined as significant increases and decreases above the spontaneous state fluctuations in dt for each animal The appearance of the visual scenes changed the balance into a series of NEX and NINH evolutions in engaging most of the exposed cortex Identical scenes evoked nearly identical sequences of NEX and NINH in the animals Figure dynamics of NEX and NINH to a visual scene with bar moving up from the CFOV significant cortex is light blue Statistically significant NINH dark blue to black scale at statistically significant NEX colors from green to red at Maximum scale values The time after the stimulus start is shown in ms on top and below dynamics associated with scene in which a bar moves upwards from the CFOV in animal parts amplitudes from to The sequence of events The NEX appears and spreads in all directions into the adjacent cortex from the two CFOV mapping sites Then an offshoot of the NEX in moves toward area and the NEX at moves left The NEX reached its maximal amplitude in areas and in areas The NEX diminishes and the NINH took over almost simultaneously in areas and The NINH spreads in all directions gaining amplitude into all exposed areas The NINH shrinks and moves pursuing the earlier NEX in both areas and areas For the scenes in which the object appeared in the CFOV and moved either up or down the statically significant NEX and NINH typical events are summarized by a representative animal in Figure also Movies which show the dynamics in anatomical space much better than any figure can The legend to Figure gives the proportion of animals having a particular statistically significant event The times after stimulus onset when these changes of NEX and NINH occurred varied among the animals by up to ms but the sequence of events was consistent in Movies The variability in the timing of the NEX and NINH became even more pronounced in the conditions in which the scenes started with a bar moving from the peripheral field of view This is characteristic for a dynamical system The sequence of dynamical events was consistent in the animals also in these conditions although minor variations could appear in the later part of the evolution NEX always preceded the first NINH The NEXs and NINHs had similar dynamics in anatomical the NINH dynamics roughly replicated that of the preceding NEX Movies Figure dynamics of NEX and NINH for bar moving upwards from peripheral field of view One animal shown parts amplitudes from to As the bars started From the CFOV the cortex that was initially active was outside the network monitored by the photodiode array in the majority of the animals Statistically significant NEX first appeared in area and in animals in area The NEX then spreads and an offshoot of the NEX in areas moves to the area of NEX The NEX in areas becomes further elongated in the cortical direction of the bar motion Then the NEXes in areas and almost simultaneously attained maximal amplitude not NEXes subsequently decrease and switch to NINH almost simultaneously in areas and after which the NINH spreads In the other animals the NEX was replaced by the balanced state for a while A second NEX appears in areas and spreading from the cortex mapping the CFOV In animals the NEX decreased and the exposed cortex went into a balanced state in animals a third NEX appeared immediately and in after a little while moving away from the CFOV mapping cortex areas and areas Behind the moving NEX a similar moving NINH appeared spreading in all directions In animals the moving NEX and following NINH disappeared from monitoring photodiodes and left the cortex in a balanced NEX NINH state Neither the NEX nor the NINH evolved to a state with motion of constant amplitude and velocity over the network In contrast the balance between excitation and inhibition changed throughout the whole evolution The changes in the balance engaged large populations of neurons in all animals The return to small amplitude baseline fluctuations of the balance may take ms dynamics but not temporal dynamics alone distinguish the visual scenes Figure showed that the mean and the mean dt of the population of neurons mapping the CFOV do not distinguish the visual scenes with a bar moving upwards from a bar moving downward from the CFOV Neither do the temporal course of the dt distinguish a stationary bar flashed in the CFOV from the bars moving from the CFOV until the stationary bar disappears and elicits an OFF response Averaging spatially over the CFOV mapping population or any other neuron population removes the dynamics In contrast just by looking at the evolution of the balance between excitation and inhibition over the four visual areas one can distinguish the five scenes Movies Similarly just by looking at the evolution of the population membrane potentials i e the caused by stationary and moving objects over the same four areas one can distinguish such simple visual scenes in carnivores and primates et al Ayzenshtat et al Harvey and Roland Figures show how when and where large populations of neurons change their balance between excitation and inhibition or change the membrane potentials at the network scale However they do not show how the brain reduces this multidimensional evolution many dimensions as points of the network to lower dimension solutions characteristic for a single or if such a reduction is at all possible For this reason we examined the dynamics in multidimensional state space This is in a state space that had as many dimensions as the number of channels in our photodiode camera namely We calculated the spatial PCA of the in localizations of the visual cortical network and plotted the first four components The first components explained of the total variance The made of the first principal components explained between and of the variance in the The animals in Movies had an extra condition in which two bars moved toward each other and Roland In state space the caused by one visual scene produced one trajectory The trajectories of the of all scenes first evolved in a chaotic like manner in a small part of the state space throughout the period and into the period Movies Within ms the trajectories accelerated diverged and continued to diverge in state space This was especially clearly seen in the projection of principal components and This result was consistent in all animals The time the individual trajectories left the chaotic like state in small part of state space where this behavior took place depended on the time the first statistically significant NEX appeared in the monitored cortex This delay ranged from to ms ms ms standard The longer delays seemed related to the time it took for the NEX to spread in the four visual areas Figure evolution of in areas produce flow on low dimension manifold State space projection of principal components and of the spatial dimension state space of all five visual scenes Each condition s trajectory has a marking its position in state space at the time of the snapshot marked in ms and a of its previous ms course Condition codes bar moving down from CFOV bar moving up from CFOV bar moving down from periphery bar moving up from periphery stationary bar Snapshots showing evolution from trajectories to accelerating diverging trajectories moment at which the trajectories diverge in animals respectively For the true dynamics see Movies This means that the evolution of the in all parts of the exposed network first evolved in a chaotic like manner by spatial cooperative activity similarly to the temporal dynamics in Figure Soon after the upper cortical layers became net excited and the thus increased and this increase spread in the network reducing the complexity of the network membrane potential changes to roughly a evolution at ms progressing in time uniquely for each of the or visual scenes evolution of spiking in areas and We had electrode penetrations in areas and In Movies the reconstructed position of each site is mapped on the hexagonal photodiode array monitoring the visual areas Depending on how many of the trials that showed evoked spiking in a certain ms Methods for definition of evoked the color changed from light blue to red Movies show initial spreading of the evoked spiking in the network up to ms For the stationary object the evoked spiking outside the retinotopic mapping of the object in areas and ceased in the granular layer but continued albeit weakly in the supragranular layers For the scenes with moving objects there was some spiking ahead of the retinotopic evoked spiking at ms characteristic for each scene described by Harvey et al Thereafter there was a more ordered progression of retinotopic spiking movies for spiking to the other scenes at https www dropbox com sh However only the spikes from a single penetration were obtained simultaneously therefore it made no sense to perform a spatial PCA on these reconstructed data If one compares the evolution of the evoked spiking with the evolution of dt and Movies the changes and the changes of balance take up a larger territory of the network in areas and Furthermore it is obvious that the spiking even in the upper cortical layers from to ms and in periods thereafter continues seemingly unaffected by the NINH regimes Delayed balance So far our results unambiguously showed that the smaller fluctuations in the balance after the impact of the visual scenes is replaced by a large amplitude NEX that after some ms switches to a NINH Movies The network of the four visual areas could still be balanced in the sense that inhibition sooner or later would bring it back to a stable state when the impact of the scenes cease et al We examined the local amount of NEX and NINH p in the four areas by integrating the NEX over the whole period ms and then dividing by the number of samples and then repeating this for the NINH The integrated NEX matched the integrated NINH in distribution and amount in all areas The correlations between the average integrated NEX and average integrated NINH for all cortical locations in all animals and all conditions of moving bars n were all highly significant p The average delays between the maximum NEX and the minimum of the NINH n were for the two conditions with the bar starting at the CFOV ms stand For the two conditions with the bar starting in the peripheral field of view ms and for the stationary square condition ms The average slope of the regression was stand indicating that on the average the amount of NEX became balanced by an equal amount NINH These results were largely independent of the duration of the period over which the NEX and NINHs were integrated For example reducing the period to be from to ms and even from to ms after stimulus onset did not affect the strong correlation between NEX and NINH The figures of average integrated NEXs NINHs and their spatial correlations in all animals and conditions are available at https www dropbox com sh Figure Spatial distribution and correlation of average NEX and NINH First column stimuli and correlations of average NEX and NINH at the cortical locations having NEX and NINH Second column Top images distributions of the delay between maximum NEX and the NINH minimum for each cortical location Bottom significant p NEX and NINH from each of the locations in the four visual areas ms Third column spatial distribution of average NEX in the visual areas Last column spatial distribution of NINH in the visual areas Scale values should be multiplied with The average NINH at each location is proportional to the average NEX Across animals and conditions the slope of the correlation was not significantly different from Object moving down from CFOV one animal Object moving up from CFOV one animal Object moving down from peripheral FOV one animal Object moving up from peripheral FOV one animal These results showed that there was no instantaneous or fast tight balance between NEX and NINH after the perturbation by the stimuli Instead at any spot in the participating cortical network the was after a delay of ms balanced by an equal amount of This also implied that the NEX and NINH occupied identical network territory Propagation speeds of NEX and NINH There were several forms of propagation of the NEX and NINH in the cortical network First the spreads out from the retinotopic mapping site in area when a visual object is flashed in the FOV et al Roland et al Then the NEX became oriented in the direction mapping the trajectory of the object and then the NEX branched out from areas moving toward the NEX in areas Examination of these dynamics show that they were partly superimposed i e after a while it is not possible to describe the NEX of the membranes as a single having one direction Movies As seen in Figure there was a relatively large range of speeds of both NEX and NINH spanning from to mm ms The distribution of speeds was similar in areas and areas The mean speed square root of the variance was mm ms for the initial NEX and mm ms for the first NINH in areas with no statistical difference between NEX and NINH p t In areas the speeds were mm ms for the first NEX and mm ms for the first NINH with no statistical significance p t In summary there were no differences between the speeds of the first NEX and the first NINH propagation and no difference in speeds between the primary visual areas and the higher areas The progression speed of the second NEX was n mm ms and the second NINH n mm ms Figure Speeds of NEX and NINH and delays between areas Distribution of speeds of propagation in areas and of the first NEX and NINH for all four scenes with moving objects Same but for areas and Distributions of minimum latencies of the first NEX and NINH in ms between areas and area Phase delays When the objects moved along on the display screen first the neurons in areas and spiked and went into NEX then the neurons in areas and spiked and went into NEX Thus the NEX will appear in several versions in several visual areas each delayed more and more compared to the primary visual cortex We asked whether there existed a mechanism that brought the membrane potentials into phase In order to calculate the phase differences in the cortex we Hilbert transformed the data files et al Calculated over a time interval of ms the Hilbert transformed data gives a single image of the cortex showing the phase latencies in ms The NEX delay between areas and areas in all animals and conditions is shown in Figure and was ms square root of and significantly greater than p n The NINH delay between area and areas was not significantly different from p n in mean ms This indicated that when the NINH starts the phase differences were not obvious To further illustrate this we spatially aligned the measurements of animals with roughly matching cytoarchitectural borders by simple affine transformations to show the evolution of the normalized across animals Normalizing all pixels to their max being removes the amplitude differences but maintains their phase relations Movie n shows that for the bar moving down from the peripheral field of view the in areas leads that of areas from ms up to ms and thereafter the area catches up to nullify the phase differences at ms and onwards Figure Phase latency maps of first NEX and NINH in four scenes The Hilbert plots show the phase latencies of the first NEX and NINH in ms between the start location in cortex the minimum and the remaining parts of the cortex Note the ms delays between area of the and areas of for NEX start Animal Discussion We presented the following main results The appearance of the visual scenes drove the network away from a more tightly balanced state into sequences of expansive NEXs and NINHs NEX and NINH propagated through the network with similar speeds Locally in the network the amount of NINH was strongly correlated with the amount of NEX appearing ms earlier This implied that the NIMH matched the NEX spatially and dynamically albeit with a delay The temporal dynamics of the NEX and NINH could not distinguish the visual scenes in all cases The dynamics in all parts of the exposed network evolved early to reduce the complexity of the network membrane potential changes to roughly a evolution progressing in time uniquely for each of the visual scenes Temporal dynamics Our in vivo measurements and data treatment of the VSD i impose some constraints on the interpretation of the results First we averaged the single trials to get the Second we applied a temporal filter on the to exclude high frequency fluctuations Third the VSD i at each cortical point of measurement stems from dendrites and axons belonging to tens of thousands of neurons This implies that individual fluctuations of the sum of membrane currents have been suppressed and therefore we can only characterize the average behavior of the network Fourth because the cell bodies only make up a minute proportion of the total membrane surfaces of neurons and Harris the NEX and NINH may not agree with somatic patch clamp data and Mitchell Fifth the dye signal is proportional to the surface of the stained membranes thus signaling mainly the membrane potential changes in large populations of dendrites and axons in the upper layers of the network This means that the membrane compartment providing the NEX and NINH is a mixture of and elements Sixth in in vitro experiments isoflurane concentration increase a K leak current modestly and linearly in thalamic neurons and Puil which could depress the spiking driving the NEX In another in vitro experiment the dye RH enhanced the response at concentrations used in our experiments et al Thus the dt results may be slightly biased toward NINH However a recent modeling study show that these inhibitory effects might be negligible and Chavane In addition inhibition in anesthetized mice and was weaker than in awake mice et al Finally at each point of measurement the NEX and NINH only report relative changes in the sum of the ion currents in the membrane compartment Consequently the NINH cannot distinguish decreases in the sum of inward currents from increases in the sum of outward currents and the NEX does not distinguish increases in inward currents from decreases in outward currents These limitations however cannot effect the results that the presentations of visual scenes with moving objects lead to longer ms lasting episodes of NEX and nor that the amount of NEX locally in the four visual areas subsequently is matched by an equal amount of NINH The impact of the afferent potentials switched the balance in the visual cortex from a tight temporal balance to a delayed balance The period of permits active spiking to propagate through the network When the network is perturbed by stimuli its connectivity and the behavior of the inhibitory neurons allow larger deviations from the spontaneous state When the visual scenes disappear the delayed balance implies that the network will return to the regime of smaller fluctuations from the baseline although slowly Movies Our results complement studies of balanced excitation and inhibition performed on single cell bodies Although our results are incompatible with a tight temporal balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents after the impact of a change in the visual scene and although our cortical is practically blind to what happens at the somata of the neurons the result that there is a ms delay in the cortical network between maximal net excitatory and maximal net inhibitory currents is similar to recordings from the cell body In a subset of earlier single neuron patch clamp findings in lightly anesthetized cats and ferrets similar or even longer delays were found between excitatory and inhibitory conductances et al Martinez et al Monier et al Priebe and Ferster Tan et al Baudot et al However the delay between excitation and inhibition may depend on animal order et al For carnivores it may also depend on the type of visual stimulus e g drifting grating object or a natural scene et al Martinez et al Monier et al Priebe and Ferster Tan et al Baudot et al Natural scenes might evoke shorter delays than those we observed et al Our results are compatible with observations that the spiking of excitatory and inhibitory neurons matches over longer time scales et al Our result gives the overall delay in dendrites axon terminals and cell bodies belonging to an estimated neurons that the cell body measurements cannot predict As seen from Figure the delay varied locally from to ms This is what would be expected from large network with dynamics Our overall result does not exclude shorter or longer delays in selected single neurons Onat et al computed the average time courses for a drifting grating and natural scenes and estimated the decay VSD signal by a straight line processing of different gratings showed a strong adaptational decay of net excitation levels For gratings its negative slope was equal to s CI s meaning that after only s of presentation time amplitudes declined to half of the peak activity levels During stimulation with natural movies the mean adaptational decay was s CI s and the median slope was found to be only marginally different from zero test P From which they drew the conclusion drifting oriented gratings are processed in a regime and in contrast natural movies processing is generally characterized by overall stationary balance between excitation and et al Neither Eriksson et al Harvey et al Harvey and Roland nor we could fine any time segments over the first ms in which the temporal course of the dt of the period to stationary and moving stimuli was approximately linear This indicates that the time course of the balance between excitation and inhibition in response to these stimuli most likely is dynamic i e changing continuously The time course of the inhibition may depend on the duration of the stimuli The shorter the stimulus the deeper the inhibition elicited by the stimulus offset et al When two bars move toward each other in the field of view the local balance between excitation and inhibition turn to inhibition in advance of their mutual occlusion For the time interval of occlusion the spiking locally at the retinotopical spot in primary visual cortex becomes tuned to that representing one single bar and Roland This might illustrate a property of the local network to modulate the balance for of local visual details It is often claimed that the cerebral cortex is similar to a balanced neuronal network The visual cortex is continuously spiking in vivo even when it is not driven by external stimuli and Wiesel The spiking in this spontaneous state is slow and irregular associated with moderate amplitude fluctuations of the membrane currents indicating a relatively tight balance of et al Monier et al Huys et al Figure This however does not necessarily mean that the cerebral cortex behaves like a balanced neuronal network Even in very large balanced neuronal networks with many biologically relevant details the spiking rapidly dies out unless it is driven by an external input and Edelman Kumar et al Markram et al This holds also for the classical balanced neuronal network that swift and nearly linearly responds to an increase in the external drive with a new equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory currents Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky which is in contrast to our results Movies dynamics in the cortical network We described the dynamics of the membrane potential changes in two different spaces the topological space made of the cortical network of synaptic connected neurons Movies and the state space depicted as orthogonal principal component projections Movies In the cortical network anatomical space one can see the spatial evolution of NEX and NINH in time and get an intuitive sense of their dynamics The visually evoked dynamics of the dt started with a NEX in a small zone spreading in all directions including the direction opposite to that mapping of the moving object After this followed a NINH with similar dynamics Movies Although the increase appearing after visual scene shifts always spreads laterally in the cortex in Roland et al we now show that this is composed of NEX dynamics followed by a similar spreading NINH dynamics The spreading NEX dynamics enable the spiking related to two different objects to interact at a distance and interact with the visual background and Roland The speed of NEX spread varied from to mm ms in all four areas from the two cortical sites mapping the retinotopic position in areas and indicating that the NEX spread may be fast from the mapping neurons as well as more slowly via neurons not mapping the bar in the cortical surround The hypothesis is in accordance with the result that there were neurons entering the evoked spiking state outside the CFOV retinotopic site for a short instance initially These speeds are also in accordance with the spread of increases observed in primates and by et al Speculatively the spread of the NINH into the adjacent cortex could be done by long axons from inhibitory neurons spiking in the mapping zone et al The slower spreading of NINH could hardly be but caused by the disappearance of excitation locally combined with local spiking of inhibitory neurons At the mapping site the spiking increased again after ms this might be an increase of spiking mainly by inhibitory neurons because this spiking increase coincided with the NINH getting deeper As the excitatory drive now was gone the object this would cause the excitation to decrease also locally in the surroundings of the mapping zone where the always spiking inhibitory neurons would take over et al The first NINH covered large regions including the retinotopic spiking zones related to the object ms after the NEX Movies However the layer and neurons continued to spike at these subsequent retinotopic sites during the NINH Apparently this spiking was insufficient to drive the network into NEX This is not so surprising as the reflects membrane potential changes of all membranes The finding though illustrates that the network around spiking excitatory neurons can be in a different regime The widespread inhibitory regime might prevent the spread of the evoked spiking in the interval ms after the start of the stimuli and hence confine the evoked spiking to the retinotopic zone The individual variations in appearance of second NEXs and NINHs and third NEXs and NINHs became more pronounced as time after the stimulus onset increased as expected for a dynamical system A full description of individual variations should ideally be on a single trial basis which was not possible for the present data of dt Some theoretical models replicate essential parts of the dynamics to stationary and moving objects in the primary visual cortex of primates and carnivores This includes the lateral spreading of the increases and dynamics giving rise to visual illusions et al Deco and Roland Markounikau et al Markounikau et al show that the most likely is composed to a large extent of inhibition modeled as the time derivative of the population membrane potentials which is in accordance with our results However none of the models have spontaneous ongoing membrane current fluctuations and hence do not predict the transition from tight to delayed balance In the Chemla and Chavane s model different delays between excitatory and inhibitory spiking modulates the shape of the and hence affect also the dt Although many models including the above mentioned have a strong local coupling between excitation and inhibition in accordance with to our knowledge this has not lead to predictions of the dynamics of the long delays between NEX and NINH One model study predicts the NEX propagation from area toward areas at ms Deco and Roland One recent model predicts that excitation and inhibition under certain synaptic regimes can segregate spatially at the mesoscopic scale et al This is in contrast to our finding of a strong local correlation between NEX and NINH in the four visual areas and the results in Figures When the scene appears at time first the spiking from the lateral geniculate nucleus breaks the tight balance between excitation and inhibition and drives the network into NEX and evoked spiking at the retinotopic spot for the bar Movies The temporal dynamics of the NEX at this spot of the network does not distinguish a stationary bar from bars moving up or down neither do the temporal course and the temporal dynamics of the evoked spiking Forsberg et al The evoked spiking at this initial spot drives the surrounding network into NEX with similar temporal dynamics engaging the network over nearly all of the exposed cortical surface Movies However after ms the driving by the retinal input spikes has moved to an adjacent spot in the network where the previous spreading NEX facilitates the evoked spiking accordance with the models of Rangan et al Markounikau et al At this new spot the spreading NEX changes to be more specific to the visual scene driving it at ms and onwards The evolution of the NEX and NINH in is a succinct mathematical description of the collaboration of all parts of the exposed cortical network comprising the four visual areas The made of the first principal components i e a manifold is a mathematical object on which the flow of the NEX and NINH for each scene evolves The evolution of the specific dynamics starts with the divergence of the trajectories at ms showing the cooperative membrane potential changes of the total network The departure from the chaotic like behavior and divergence of the trajectories coincided with the NEX spreading to cover most of the exposed cortex The trajectories continued to diverge over the next ms when the net inhibitory regime takes over at ms It is at this point of time the evoked spiking becomes more clearly related to current scene Eriksson et al The trajectories on the manifold thus show the dynamics of the membrane potential changes leading up to the ms when the scene is likely to be perceived et al Chen et al Eriksson et al Onat et al b using a drifting grating as stimulus and principal component analysis showed that some components reflected the wave propagation from the moving gratings whereas the first components reflected the stationary feature i e the orientation of the grating If one looks at Movies one can see that the first components contribute to the divergent flows over the manifold although the divergence was slightly larger in the projection of the and component Thus in our case there was no separation of space vs time in the dynamics In our case the retinotopic mapping of the moving object moved over the cortical network so one could think that this was the reason for the discrepancy However if one focus on the flow associated with the stationary square in Movies gray in Movies this was also affected by the first components Another reason for the discrepancy could be that the first ms were discarded from the analysis in the Onat et al study In contrast our stimuli and analysis was starting from ms and thus biased toward transients The evolution to low dimensional flow would not have been possible if the network had remained in tight balance as also seen in Movies The spontaneous state is a stable state et al Forsberg et al For sensory areas in general the tight balance between excitation and inhibition must be broken to allow the evoked spiking and NEX to propagate in the network to engage as many neurons as possible in the dynamics driven by the scene Even if the neurons are only engaged this makes the solution of the network robust The subsequent NINH appearing locally in the network at ms removes excess spiking outside the part of the network engaged in mapping the progress of the bar and hence probably sharpens and further stabilizes perception It remains to be tested whether the dynamic separation also works in single trials This question was not possible to answer with our present data Conclusions We measured the balance between NEX and NINH in the network of dendrites and axons in the upper layers of four visual areas Our results complement studies of the balance in the cell bodies of single neurons The appearance of visual scenes with moving objects elicited longer ms lasting episodes with larger deviations of NEX and NINH from baseline and at times sequences of several NEXs and NINHs implying that it took some ms for the balance to return to the state of small fluctuations These results are incompatible with a fast tight balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents and with the behavior of a classic balanced network Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky Locally in the network in all four areas the amount of NINH with a delay matched the amounts of NEX for these episodes The NEX and NINH thus were also matched spatially in the network in our case within ms by local inhibition Thus the network should return to the baseline or state when the last episode of NINH is finished The temporal dynamics of the changes in the population membrane potentials the dt spread to all zones of the visual areas with similar trajectories resembling those of a excitable system In contrast to the temporal dynamics of the dt and hence the NEX and NINH the NINH and NEX dynamics in anatomical space as well as in abstract state space explained how differences evolved to distinguish simple visual scenes We do not know whether these mechanisms also will explain differences in natural complex scenes dynamics of the changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition evolved at a much larger scale than that used to examine receptive fields changes in single neurons The dynamics are missed with local probes and are only captured by a high frequency sampling network approach The results of the collaboration in this large network were succinctly described as diverging trajectories after ms on a in state space The network in the four areas operated with similar local temporal dynamics to the presentation of the visual scenes whereas its dynamics evolved to distinguish the scenes Author contributions PR and MH designed the experiments MH did the experiments LB LF and PR
